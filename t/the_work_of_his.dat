5|$|The initial {{years of}} his office were {{relatively}} uneventful. Gebhard continued some of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessor, Salentin, chiefly in {{the reconstruction of the}} Arnsberg castle in Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|In {{his career}} as a scholar-official for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an {{ambassador}} to the Western Xia Dynasty and Liao Dynasty, a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the Hanlin Academy. By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy. With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science, and proposed many reforms to the Chinese calendar alongside <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colleague Wei Pu. With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court.|$|E

5|$|Now outside Parliament, Odlum {{maintained}} {{his presence in}} the public eye through meetings and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newspaper, The Crusader. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} attribution to Droeshout {{the younger}} {{can also be}} supported on stylistic grounds. A drawing known to be by Droeshout the elder appears to show superior artistic skill than <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nephew, and the clumsy features of the depiction of Shakespeare's body resemble other prints by Droeshout the Younger. The attribution to the younger artist is provisionally accepted by the National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
5|$|The name Book of Kells {{is derived}} from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and place of {{production}} {{have been the subject of}} considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba, possibly even as <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date 800, long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.|$|E

5|$|Domestically, Henry {{is known}} for his radical changes to the English Constitution, {{ushering}} in the theory of the divine right of kings to England. Besides asserting the sovereign's supremacy over the Church of England, he greatly expanded royal power during his reign. Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial, by means of bills of attainder. He achieved many of his political aims through <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Richard Rich, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry's administration. He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome. Despite the influx of money from these sources, Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars, particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|For their {{elegance and}} {{restrained}} tones, Thayer's {{portraits of the}} mid-1880s, and particularly The Sisters, have been cited as influential to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> younger colleague Dennis Miller Bunker.|$|E

50|$|Beethoven's stylistic {{innovations}} {{bridge the}} Classical and Romantic periods. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early period brought the Classical form to its highest expressive level, expanding in formal, structural, and harmonic terms the musical idiom developed by predecessors such as Mozart and Haydn. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> middle and late periods {{were even more}} forward-looking, appropriately being categorized in and contributing to the musical language and thinking of the Romantic era, directly inspiring other Romantic composers such as Frédéric Chopin, Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms.|$|R
50|$|John Levy (1910-1976) was a British mystic, artist, and musician, {{best known}} for {{translating}} <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guru Sri Atmananda Krishna Menon, Atma Darshan and Atma Niviriti into English.|$|R

25|$|Various reasons impelled Lucien Biva {{to emigrate}} to the United States. His {{father was a}} {{well-known}} painter, {{and it may have}} been difficult for Lucien Biva {{to make a name for}} himself without being linked to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father.|$|E
25|$|He {{wished to}} reach this `holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s—despite his related health problems—took its toll, and finally {{prevented}} him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents {{a radical departure from}} reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> student Robert Rosen.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Mozart's {{music is}} inevitably overshadowed by <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son Wolfgang, {{and in any}} case the father willingly sacrificed his own career to promote his son's. But Leopold's Cassation in G for Orchestra and Toys (Toy Symphony), once {{attributed}} to Joseph Haydn, remains popular, and a number of symphonies, a trumpet concerto, and other works also survive.|$|E
50|$|Apollodorus himself wrote little, and {{his whole}} theory could be {{gathered}} only from <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> disciples, Gaius Valgius and Atticus. Lucian states that Apollodorus {{died at the}} age of eighty-two.|$|R

25|$|Raskin was {{a long-time}} member of BAYCHI, the Bay-Area Computer-Human Interface group, a {{professional}} organization for human-interface designers.

25|$|Horace's {{influence}} can {{be observed}} in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> near contemporaries, Ovid and Propertius. Ovid followed his example in creating a completely natural style of expression in hexameter verse, and Propertius cheekily mimicked him in his third book of elegies. His Epistles provided them both with a model for their own verse letters and it also shaped Ovid's exile poetry.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy systematized {{the study}} of astronomy, drawing on <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{predecessors}} to build astronomy upon a secure empirical basis and to demonstrate the relationship between astronomical observations and the resulting astronomical theory. His Almagest defined the method and subject matter of future astronomical research and the Ptolemaic system became the dominant model for the motions of the heavens.|$|E

25|$|The Robert {{brothers}} were skilled engineers with a workshop at the Place des Victoires in Paris, {{who worked with}} professor Jacques Charles to build the first usable hydrogen balloon in 1783. Charles conceived the idea that hydrogen would be a suitable lifting agent for balloons because, as a chemist, he had studied <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries Henry Cavendish, Joseph Black and Tiberius Cavallo.|$|E
25|$|A man of {{the theater}} first and foremost, Caragiale was well-acquainted with <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors, from William Shakespeare to the Romantics, and heavily {{impressed}} by the French comédie en vaudeville. He applied the notion of well-made plays, as theorized by Eugène Scribe, and was also influenced by the dramaturgy of Eugène Marin Labiche and Victorien Sardou. Reportedly, Labiche was his favorite author.|$|E
25|$|Ancient {{sources are}} {{virtually}} unanimous in ascribing the synoptic gospels to the apostle Matthew, Peter's interpreter Mark, and Paul's companion Luke, hence their respective canonical names. A remark by Augustine {{at the turn}} of the fifth century presents the gospels as composed in their canonical order (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), with each evangelist thoughtfully building upon and supplementing <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors—the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew–Mark).|$|E
50|$|He {{started to}} paint portraits before his Kiev period. The {{earliest}} known portraits <b>of</b> <b>his</b> are portraits <b>of</b> Elizabeth of Russia. He {{did not meet}} his model, but based the paintings on <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teacher, Louis Caravaque.|$|R
50|$|He wrote {{a number}} of short stories and novels, poetry and {{theatrical}} pieces, <b>the</b> early <b>work</b> being in general the most significant, particularly <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> so-called 'youthful maturity', the {{collection of short stories}} Dialogo dei massimi sistemi (1937).|$|R
