5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If <b>the</b> <b>device</b> {{is supported by the}} host, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> drivers needed for communicating with <b>the</b> <b>device</b> are loaded and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E
5|$|Before the Battery Charging Specification was defined, {{there was}} no {{standardized}} way for the portable device to inquire how much current was available. For example, Apple's iPod and iPhone chargers indicate the available current by voltages on the D− and D+ lines. When D+ = D− = 2.0V, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> may pull up to 500mA. When D+ = 2.0V and D− = 2.8V, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> may pull up to 1A of current. When D+ = 2.8V and D− = 2.0V, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> may pull up to 2A of current.|$|E
