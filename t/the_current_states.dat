25|$|Keep a set data {{structure}} of all states which the NFA might currently be in. On {{the consumption of}} an input symbol, unite {{the results of the}} transition function applied to all current states to get the set of next states; if ε-moves are allowed, include all states reachable by such a move (ε-closure). Each step requires at most s2 computations, where s is the number of states of the NFA. On the consumption of the last input symbol, if one of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> is a final state, the machine accepts the string. A string of length n can be processed in time O(ns2), and space O(s).|$|E

25|$|The Territory of Oregon was an {{organized}} incorporated {{territory of the}} United States that existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859, when the southwestern portion of the territory {{was admitted to the}} Union as the State of Oregon. Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), the region was divided between the UK and US in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana. The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, then back to Salem, which became the state capital upon Oregon's admission to the Union.|$|E
25|$|The Franciscans were {{in charge}} of the evangelization process in the state, {{starting}} from 1524, when they founded the monastery of Huejotzingo. Between 1540 and 1560, they founded others such as those in Tecamachalco, Quecholac, Tecali, Calpan, Cuautinchán, Zacatlán, Cholula, Huaquechula, Tepeaca, Tehuacán, Xalpa and Coatepec. The Augustinians arrived next, constructing monasteries in Chiautla, Chietla, Huatlatlauca, Tlapa, Xicotepec and Papaloticpac. The last of the evangelists were the Dominicans, who built monasteries at Izúcar de Matamoros, Tepapayeca, Huehuatlán and Tepexi. The bishopric was established in 1526. Initially, the seat was in the Yucatán, but it was eventually moved to Tlaxcala, then to Puebla by 1550. Eventually, its extension included <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> of Tlaxcala and Puebla during much of the colonial period.|$|E
