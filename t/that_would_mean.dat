5|$|In March 2009, it was {{announced}} that Jim Knight, Minister of State for Schools and Families, had approved plans <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> the closure of both Ladymead Community School and the nearby St Augustine of Canterbury RC/CoE School both in the Priorswood area of Taunton. The schools closed in August 2010, and were replaced in September 2010 by The Taunton Academy.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E

50|$|On 16 November 2001, Spain {{offered to}} {{allocate}} 70,000 numbers to Gibraltar. However, Gibraltar refused the offer, citing <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> giving Spain {{control of its}} numbering policy.|$|R

25|$|The {{disagreements}} {{continued on}} other topics; the Prince {{wanted to build}} a palace, but Venizelos strongly opposed it as <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> perpetuation of the current arrangement of Governorship; Cretans accepted it only as temporary, until a final solution was found. Relations between the two men became increasingly soured, and Venizelos repeatedly submitted his resignation.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{percentages}} provided in the six-class model by Gilbert, {{as well as the}} model of Thompson and Hickey, one can apply U.S.Census Bureau statistics regarding income. According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52nd and 84th percentile of society. In terms of personal income distribution in 2005, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> gross annual personal incomes from about $32,500 to $60,000.|$|E

25|$|Could the {{woodland}} {{have survived}} {{this level of}} industrial use? The two resources that the Romans needed were ironstone and fuel. With both available on one site, this would make it an attractive location, but to ensure continuity of fuel supply, it would seem most likely that they encouraged re-growth through a coppice-style system. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that there was continuity of woodland trees and habitats throughout and after the Roman period, and possibly since the ice receded.|$|E
25|$|The season {{concludes with}} {{the revelation of}} a plot to force Britain and Russia into war. Harry manages to thwart the plot and decides to leave the service to {{live a normal life}} with Ruth Evershed. But when a vengeful Sasha Gavrik {{attempts}} to take revenge on him, Ruth takes the blow for Harry before dying in his arms. Harry then decides to return to MI5, the prospect of a normal life, whatever <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> without Ruth, no longer appealing to him.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most Senate Presidents {{that are}} the {{symbolic}} presiding officers of the upper house, the Senate President of the Philippines wields considerate power by influencing the legislative agenda and {{has the ability to}} vote not just in order to break ties, although the Senate President is traditionally the last senator to vote. A tied vote, therefore, means that the motion is lost, and that the Senate President cannot cast a tie-breaking vote since <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that the presiding officer would have had voted twice.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 {{the county}} planned {{to expand the}} ski hill, but Indians objected <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> cutting grave marker trees and {{disturbing}} burials. A compromise was reached in 2003 and little has changed since then.|$|R

25|$|The Forum of National Parties, an {{association}} of 12 moderate Islamist parties, said it rejected the proposed election law because it encouraged voting along tribal lines and gave undue influence to the wealthy. According to Wasila al-Ashiq, head {{of one of the}} parties represented in the organization, candidates would have to run as independents under the proposed law because Libya has no law regulating political parties. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that those candidates capable of drawing on tribal power and affiliation would win the seats, she said, while minorities such as the Berbers would be ignored.|$|E
25|$|The RLIF's {{scheduling}} of competitions made {{shortly after}} its formation, specifically {{the timing of}} world cups, was criticised by Graham Clay, editor of Open Rugby magazine for opting for a four-yearly cycle beginning in 2002 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> rugby league facing strong competition from other major sporting events for corporate sponsorship. During the build-up to the 2008 World Cup, which had been timed to coincide with Australia's Centenary of Rugby League celebrations, it was stated and confirmed afterwards that the following tournament in the United Kingdom would be held in 2013 to avoid the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and that subsequent World Cups would be contested on a four-year cycle.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have linked the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr with the Nine Daughters of Ægir (whose parentage and names combined imply waves), an identification <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that Heimdallr was thus born from {{the waves of}} the sea. However, this connection has been questioned {{on the grounds that}} the names presented for the Nine Daughters of Ægir (whose names point to waves) and the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr (as found in Völuspá hin skamma) do not match. Scholar John Lindow comments that the identification of Heimdallr's mothers as Ægir's daughters do, however, match on the grounds that Ægir's daughters, like Heimdallr's mothers, are sisters, and that two separate traditions about Heimdallr's mothers may explain the differences between the two.|$|E

50|$|In one study, {{participants}} were asked to judge which of two road improvement plans would be more efficient in reducing mean journey time. Respondents preferred a plan <b>that</b> <b>would</b> increase the <b>mean</b> speed from 70 to 110 km/h more than a plan <b>that</b> <b>would</b> increase the <b>mean</b> speed from 30 to 40 km/h, although the latter actually saves more time (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 1).|$|R
25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally {{seen through the}} prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|The cathodes of {{some early}} 2007 {{lithium-ion}} batteries {{are made from}} lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is expensive, and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates, the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge. The price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about US$5000, some US$3000 of which is for their NiMH battery packs. At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> a break-even point after six to ten years of operation. The conventional hybrid premium could fall to US$2000 in five years, with US$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing for a three-year payback. The payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids, because of their larger, more expensive batteries.|$|E
25|$|First of all, {{the law of}} the pursuer only {{applies to}} a {{spontaneous}} act, whereas Yigal Amir planned this assassination for two years. Secondly, {{the law of the}} pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent death. There is absolutely no proof that withdrawing from certain territories will directly lead to the death of any Jews. On the contrary, Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite—that it will save Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that Amir should have killed over half the population of Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act was totally futile and senseless since the peace process will continue.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{strictly}} geological definition, a small region {{south of the}} Main near Wertheim and another south of Gemünden can be {{considered part of the}} Spessart. <b>That</b> definition <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> part of the Spessart lies in the state of Baden-Württemberg.|$|R

25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an energy plan that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E
500|$|Barton's agent Willie McKay {{revealed}} in January 2007 {{that if any}} team offered at least £5.5million for Barton, it would trigger a release clause in his contract <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> City would have to allow Barton {{to talk to the}} interested club. This reportedly prompted Everton manager David Moyes to make an inquiry to City about Barton's availability. However, the next day Barton said [...] "People are trying to unsettle me but I'm happy to stay here".|$|E
500|$|Success on the Turkish front continued, mostly {{attributable}} to Potemkin. He now {{had the opportunity}} to confront the Turks and dictate a peace, but <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> leaving Catherine. His procrastination soured Catherine's attitude towards him, a situation compounded by Potemkin's choice of the married Princess Paskovia Adreevna Golitsyna (née Shuvalova) as his latest mistress. In the end, Potemkin was given the requisite authority to negotiate with the Turks (and, afterwards, to pursue his Polish ambitions), and dispatched by Catherine back to the south. She sent a note after him, reading [...] "Goodbye my friend, I kiss you".|$|E
50|$|The Second French Empire {{remained}} officially neutral {{throughout the}} American Civil War and never recognized the Confederate States of America.
