5|$|At {{the launch}} event, Barra {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> would initially be shipped to Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. On July13, 2012, Google began shipping the Nexus7 to customers in Australia and the US who had pre-ordered <b>the</b> <b>tablet.</b> The company released the Nexus7 to Canada and the UK {{four days later}} on July17. <b>The</b> <b>tablet</b> was released in France, Germany, and Spain on August 27, 2012, and in Japan on September 25, 2012. Two days later <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> was released in South Korea. The Nexus 7 was progressively released to selected markets, such as Portugal and India, in the following months.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given <b>the</b> <b>tablet,</b> he will explain he wishes to use <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> to Yeesha, <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro <b>the</b> <b>tablet,</b> ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|Another common rumor at {{the time}} was that <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> would have an Apple A6 processor.|$|E
50|$|The 30 nm thick {{interface}} between <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> that connects {{them together and}} the aragonite grains detected by scanning electron microscopy from which <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> themselves are made of together represent another structural level. The organic material “gluing” <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> together is made of proteins and chitin.|$|R
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "which you broke, and {{you shall}} put them," [...] in [...] Rav Joseph {{noted that the}} verse employs {{superfluous}} words to describe <b>the</b> <b>Tablets.</b> Rav Joseph reasoned that the two mentionings of <b>the</b> <b>Tablets</b> teaches that both <b>the</b> <b>Tablets</b> and <b>the</b> fragments of <b>the</b> <b>Tablets</b> that Moses broke were deposited in the Ark. Rav Joseph deduced from this that a scholar who has forgotten his learning {{through no fault of}} his own (through old age, sickness, or trouble, but not through willful neglect) is still due respect (by analogy to the broken pieces of <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> that <b>the</b> Israelites nonetheless treated with sanctity).|$|R
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} principle {{is to turn}} <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> to lift selected sets of threads in <b>the</b> warp. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> may be turned in one direction continually as a pack, turned individually to create patterns, or turned some number of times [...] "forward" [...] and the same number [...] "back". Twisting <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> in only one direction can create a ribbon that curls {{in the direction of}} the twist, though there are ways to thread <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> that mitigate this issue.|$|R
5|$|Neither the dog's grave nor mummy {{have been}} recovered. The tomb in which <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> was {{unearthed}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, {{close to the}} western side of the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops). The white limestone tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2cm (21.3×11.1×9.1in) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of a leash is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2012, Apple {{announced}} a media event scheduled for March 7, 2012, at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The company did not predisclose {{the subject of}} the event, but analysts widely expected the event to announce {{a new version of the}} iPad. The announcement affected <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> resale market positively.|$|E
5|$|The {{find was}} {{recorded}} by the main expedition photographer, Mohammedani Ibrahim, who took more than 9,321 large-format glass-plate images on Reisner's expeditions. <b>The</b> <b>tablet</b> is now held by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (inventory number JE67573).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> used in weaving are {{typically}} shaped as regular polygons, with holes near each vertex and possibly at the center, as well. The number of holes in <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> used is a limiting factor on {{the complexity of}} the pattern woven. The corners of <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> {{are typically}} rounded to prevent catching as they are rotated during weaving.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> {{containing}} 167  mg MFGM/tablet {{were produced}} by direct compression of mixtures. <b>The</b> placebo <b>tablet</b> was prepared using {{whole milk powder}} instead of MFGM. <b>The</b> placebo <b>tablets</b> had an indistinguishably similar shape, taste, and texture as that of <b>the</b> MFGM <b>tablets.</b> Each subject consumed six MFGM tablets (1  g MFGM/day: equivalent to approximately 600  mL of milk) or the placebo (1  g whole milk powder/day) tablet daily for 10  weeks. On days with exercise training, the subjects were instructed to consume <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> within 1  hour before the training. On the other days, the subjects were instructed to ingest <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> during their daily routines.|$|R
50|$|The year {{of their}} {{production}} is unknown but the signature indicates that <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> were produced by Kim Yonggu (1907 - 1982), the same calligrapher who made <b>the</b> verse <b>tablets</b> for Daeungjeon Hall. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> are undecorated, measuring about 3.5 m in length and 0.4 m across.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablet</b> was {{released}} in ten countries on March 16, 2012. It gained mostly positive reviews, earning praise for its Retina display, processor and 4G (LTE) capabilities. However, controversy arose when the LTE incompatibilities became known. Three million units were sold {{in the first three}} days.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1790s Dennie {{contributed to}} various journals, {{including}} the Federal Orrery and the Massachusetts Magazine, often using pen {{names such as}} Academicus and Socialis. In 1795, his writing being enthusiastically received, Dennie was persuaded to begin a literary journal, <b>The</b> <b>Tablet.</b> William Spotswood, a Boston printer and bookseller, agreed to oversee the entire enterprise, splitting the profits evenly with Dennie. Such a literary journal was a novel idea at the time, and it was well received among the city's elite. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, <b>The</b> <b>Tablet</b> lasted {{only a few months}} before folding, having published thirteen issues.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, reviewers noted a lack {{of support}} for {{expandable}} storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported instances when the screen would not register inputs while <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> performed data-intensive operations, while others complained about the build-quality of the screen.|$|E
500|$|Barthel {{speculated that}} the banana leaf might even {{have served as a}} {{prototype}} for <b>the</b> <b>tablets,</b> with <b>the</b> fluted surface of <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> an emulation of the veined structure of a leaf: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Bloomberg <b>tablets</b> were an {{unexpected}} find, as organic material such as wood and leather tends to rot away and disintegrate with time. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> were preserved by the thick, wet mud {{generated by the}} underground river Walbrook. The mud limited the exposure of <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> to oxygen.|$|R
50|$|Nyoka, {{with help}} from Larry Grayson, {{attempts}} to discover <b>the</b> Golden <b>Tablets</b> of Hippocrates. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> contain <b>the</b> medical knowledge of the Ancients — not to mention being buried along with gold and other treasure. Also hunting for <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> are Queen Vultura ("Ruler of the Arabs") and Cassib.|$|R
5|$|Google and Asus omitted {{cellular}} connectivity on initial {{models of}} the device, instead employing Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n as the only means for <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> to connect to the Internet. A mobile-capable version of the device utilizing HSPA+ cellular technology with 32 GB of storage was later introduced in October 2012 for $299. Unlike most tablets, the Nexus7 has NFC connectivity built in, which allows users to share files quickly with Android Beam and perform non-touch payments at sites that employ NFC cash registers.|$|E
5|$|Intersection, in {{collaboration}} with British telecommunications company BT and British advertising agency Primesight, is also planning to install up to 850 Links in the United Kingdom, including in London, beginning in 2017. The LinkUK kiosks, as they will be called, {{are similar to the}} LinkNYC kiosks in New York City. These Links will replace some of London's iconic telephone booths due to these booths' age. The first hundred Links would be installed in the borough of Camden. The Links will have tablets, but they will lack web browsing capabilities due to the problems that LinkNYC faced in enabling <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> browsers.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, {{the liner}} hosted a press luncheon, and, the next afternoon, hosted some 3,000 {{members of the}} Daughters of the American Revolution who {{presented}} a commemorative bronze tablet. Stewart L. Woodford, a former Congressman and ambassador, spoke at the ceremony dedicating <b>the</b> <b>tablet,</b> which was placed {{at the base of}} the staircase in the first-class smoking room. Beginning 24 June, the North German Lloyd opened George Washington to the public for five days of viewing of the new ship.|$|E
40|$|Ranitidine HCl is an H 2 anhistaminic drug mainly {{used for}} {{treatment}} of peptic ulcers and is absorbed 50 % orally. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism, so the attempt {{has been made to}} administer it as fast dissolving tablet to increases its oral bioavailability. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> were prepared by using sublimation method using ammonium bicarbonate as sublimating agent. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> were evaluated for hardness, wetting time, dispersion time, disintegrating time. <b>The</b> other <b>tablets</b> prepared by using sodium starch glycolate and cross carmellose sodium as superdisintegrant. It was concluded that <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> prepared by super disintergrant addition have better disintegrating properties and release profile when compared to <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> prepared by sublimation method...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Tanais <b>Tablets</b> are two tablets dated late 2nd-3rd century AD, {{and written}} in Greek {{from the city}} of Tanais, in the {{proximity}} of modern Rostov-on-Don, Russia. At the time, Tanais was composed of a mixed Greek and Sarmatian population. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> are public inscriptions which commemorate renovation works in the city. One of <b>the</b> <b>tablets,</b> Tanais Tablet A, is damaged and is not fully reconstructed. The other one, Tanais Tablet B, is fully preserved and is dated to 220 AD. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> were discovered by Russian archaeologist Pavel Mikhailovich Leontjev in 1853 and are today kept in the lapidary of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> are considered important for the early Croatian history.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses {{to carve out}} two tablets of stone like the first, come up the {{mountain}}, and make an ark of wood. God inscribed on <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> <b>the</b> Ten Commandments that were on <b>the</b> first <b>tablets</b> that Moses had smashed, and Moses {{came down from the}} mountain and deposited <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> in <b>the</b> Ark.|$|R
5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, {{as can be seen}} in the image at left.|$|E
5|$|The Nexus7 {{is powered}} by a 4,325mAh {{lithium-ion}} polymer battery that typically lasts 9.5hours and can be charged via micro-USB. In order to maximize the device's battery life, Asus engineers spent one month attempting to reduce electrical leakage by measuring heat and voltage at every point on the printed circuit board (PCB). <b>The</b> <b>tablet</b> includes a highly efficient power management integrated circuit designed by Maxim Integrated Products. Google claims the Nexus7's battery life allows 9hours of HD video playback, 10hours of web browsing or e-reading, and 300hours on standby.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Hebrew writing yet discovered, {{found at}} Khirbet Qeiyafa, {{dates to the}} 10th century BCE. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) trapezoid pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet). <b>The</b> <b>tablet</b> is written from left to right, indicating that Hebrew writing {{was still in the}} formative stage.|$|E
30|$|In {{the survey}} using Wi-Fi, <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> were {{connected}} to the wireless router by 802.11 a (5 GHz band). In the survey using Wi-Fi Direct, <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> were connected via a 2.4 GHz band.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> {{constitute}} one of {{the oldest}} archives and libraries ever found; there is tangible evidence of their arrangement and even classification. <b>The</b> larger <b>tablets</b> had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The locations of <b>the</b> fallen <b>tablets</b> allowed <b>the</b> excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves; they found <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> had originally been shelved according to subject.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> were photographed using infra-red {{sensitive}} {{cameras in}} 1973 by Susan M. Blackshaw in the British Museum and more comprehensively in 1990 at Vindolanda by Alison Rutherford. <b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> were scanned again using improved techniques in 2000-2001 with a Kodak Wratten 87C infra-red filter. The photographs are taken in infra-red {{to enhance the}} faded ink against the wood of <b>the</b> <b>tablets,</b> or between ink and dirt, to make the writing more visible.|$|R
5|$|The {{only source}} from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone {{inscription}} tablet {{that may have}} come from the funerary chapel of the dog's owner. <b>The</b> <b>tablet</b> was apparently among spolia used to build another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty mastaba, after the chapel's demolition. It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E
5|$|According to gadget site Tom's Hardware, 3–4million {{units were}} {{expected}} to sell in 2012, which would account {{for most of the}} six million tablets Asus was expecting to sell for the year. Other sources estimated that 6–8million units of <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> would be shipped before the year's end. Google initially expected to sell 3million units of the Nexus7 by the end of 2012, but Forrester Research estimates that Google met this sales target in mid-October 2012. Asus CFO David Chang said that by October, sales of the Nexus7 had approached 1million units per month. In light of Google not releasing official sales figures, mobile industry analyst Benedict Evans estimated that the device most likely sold between 4.5 and 4.6million units in 2012. According to Carphone Warehouse, the Nexus7 is the UK retailer's highest-selling Android tablet.|$|E
5|$|Alice Ayres came to renewed {{public notice}} {{with the release}} of the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber and the 2004 BAFTA Award- and Golden Globe-winning film Closer based on it {{starring}} Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen. A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres in Postman's Park, in which it is revealed that the character Jane Jones (played by Portman in the film), who calls herself Alice Ayres for most of the story, has in fact fabricated her identity based on <b>the</b> <b>tablet</b> on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, which she reads {{at the time of her}} first meeting with Dan Woolf (played by Jude Law in the film) at the beginning of the action. The park, and the memorial to Ayres, feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{complaints}} is the bulkiness of <b>the</b> <b>tablets.</b> <b>The</b> main offender is PZA (<b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> being <b>the</b> size of horse tablets). PZA syrup may be offered as a substitute, or if the size of <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> is truly an issue and liquid preparations are not available, then PZA can be omitted altogether. If PZA is omitted, the patient should be warned that {{this results in a}} significant increase in the duration of treatment (details of regimens omitting PZA are given below).|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> {{were kept}} in groups in baskets on shelves, judging by {{impressions}} left in the clay from the weaving of the baskets. When the buildings they were housed in were destroyed by fires, many of <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> were fired.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tablets</b> {{were put}} {{on display in the}} Roman Baths Museum in Bath, where they {{continue}} to be available to be viewed by the public. The inscriptions on <b>the</b> <b>tablets</b> were published in full in 1988 by historian Roger Tomlin.|$|R
