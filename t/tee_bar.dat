40|$|The key {{interest}} in ship building is {{to design a}} ship having minimum weight and maximum strength. Usage of open sections like Flat bar, Angle bar, Holland Profile and <b>Tee</b> <b>bar</b> are common in ship structure. The stiffeners of closed section offer numerous advantages as much from the structural as from the economic point of view. Hat Stiffened Plate {{has a number of}} closed profile stiffeners provided along dominant direction. A representative unit cell of Hat Stiffened Plate has been selected and numerical investigations using finite element software ANSYS have been carried out to quantify the structural advantages of hat shaped stiffeners over the commonly used open section stiffeners like flat bar, angle and tee sections. Hat stiffeners can very effectively be used in the design of lighter ships...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, straight-forward {{statistical method}} is presented here {{to assess the}} probability of reduction of geometrical properties of aged ship structural profiles. These rolled profiles such as bulb plate, <b>tee</b> <b>bar,</b> flat bar etc. begin to shrink mainly due to corrosion wear following the breakdown of protective coatings. Geometrical properties may include the stiffener cross-sectional area {{with or without the}} attached plating, moment of inertia, section modulus etc. among many others. The first set of inputs includes the statistical data about the dimensions or scantlings of the structural profiles usually collected by the manufacturers. For example, the mean and coefficient of variation (c. o. v.) of the web height, web plate thickness etc. The second set of inputs for this analysis is the evenly distributed corrosion wear; the mean wear and the c. o. v. or standard deviation of wear. Based on certain assumptions the mean and variance of the geometrical properties may be derived statistically from these basic inputs. The outputs may be used to address the following issue. The Classification Societies set up Renewal Criteria for the stiffeners/profiles in ship hull structures when they do not meet the requirements which may be, for example, cross-sectional area falling below 90 % of the original nominal value. However, the means and variances of the geometrical properties as functions of age have many other useful applications...|$|E
50|$|The double {{railroad}} {{is carried}} by four longitudinal steel trough girders, with {{the sides of}} the troughs acting as guards against derailment. These are supported by massive cross-girders riveted to the underneath of the vertical struts and lower booms of the main trusses, at 5.2 metre intervals. The decking consists of ironbark longitudinals bedded on bitumen and sand, and bolted to steel <b>tee</b> <b>bars</b> which connect the trough girders transversely.|$|R

It has a length of 136.5 m, width of 8 m, it consists of a platform of 23 flights, each flight is formed by two numbers of the ferro-concrete piles united in a frame by a ferro-concrete crossbar. From above the design is blocked by ferro-concrete plates <b>tee</b> <b>bars</b> on five plates in flight.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the age of}} 15, {{he moved}} to Atlanta, Georgia, with his sister Renetta to study {{performing}} arts. In the ensuing years, RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s. He participated in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film Star Booty, and an album by the same name. In Atlanta, RuPaul often performed at the Celebrity Club (managed by Larry <b>Tee)</b> as a <b>bar</b> dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole. RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis. RuPaul's first prominent United States national exposure came in 1989 with an extra role dancing in the video for [...] "Love Shack" [...] by The B-52's.|$|R
2500|$|Wee Burn Country Club – {{formed in}} 1895, {{it is the}} first {{organized}} golf club in the state and [...] "either the second or third in the United States." [...] The name of the club was taken from a small stream, Stony Brook, which ran through the old grounds. Originally a small house on the Post Road in Noroton (across the street from St. Luke's Episcopal Church) was rented for a clubhouse and nearby land for a seven-hole course was rented. The lease stipulated that the links couldn't prevent the landlord from continuing to use the fields as pasture for his cows. Eventually more land was bought on Hollow Tree Ridge Road and the course was enlarged to nine holes and then 18 by (at the latest) the 1930s. The club is the largest taxpayer in Darien, with an assessed property value (equal to 70 percent of estimated value) of $29.8 million. As recently as 1999, the club did not allow women as full members – they were subject to restricted <b>tee</b> times and <b>barred</b> from the clubhouse.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} robust methods of FEA to evaluate non-linear lower bound limit load estimates of ship type structures. The robust methods used in this thesis include the r-node method, Progressive Modulus Reduction (PMR) method, and the mα method. The results of each technique are compared {{to the results of}} full nonlinear finite element analysis, analytical solutions and lab test data where available. The structures modelled in this thesis included a rectangular indeterminate beam, three types of mainframe stiffeners (flat <b>bar,</b> angle and <b>tee),</b> a flat <b>bar</b> stiffened panel and an Arctic icebreaker grillage. [...] Robust methods make use of a modulus reduction scheme to redistribute and relax peak stresses in the structure. By iterating and selectively correcting the local modulus in finite element models, the form of a limit state stress distribution can be evaluated. In order for the limit loads evaluated based on this limit state stress distribution to be lower bound, the conditions of the stress field in the structure must be "statically admissible. ” [...] The basis of the r-node method is the identification of redistribution nodes or r-nodes within a structure, which are essentially load-controlled locations. Identification of exact r-node locations may be difficult to achieve with finite mesh densities particularly in complex structures. As well, complicated structures pose added difficulties in achieving a progressive r-node stress relaxation with increased iterations. This may be partly attributed to the difficulty in locating exact r-node locations. [...] The mα method was developed in an attempt to improve lower bound estimates of limit loads, making use of just two linear elastic analyses. The notion of a "reference volume is used in conjunction with the "theorem of nesting surfaces" and the concept of leapfrogging to a near limit state to evaluate lower and upper bounds on the limit load. The results of this thesis indicate that for complicated structures~ improved limit load estimates can be obtained if four or more iterations of moduli are carried out. Reducing the rate of relaxation (reducing modulus adjustment index q) may enhance convergence characteristics, but results in a higher state of limit stress evaluated. [...] The Progressive Modulus Reduction (PMR) method, which is an extension of the elastic compensation method, systematically adjusts or reduces the moduli of the pseudo-elastic stressed elements of a structure to synthesise the growth of the yield zone. The PMR method is used to evaluate the non-linear deflection of the structure for applied loads up to the limit load. [...] In general the robust methods are an attractive alternative for evaluating limit loads of ship type structures. Results are a significant improvement over classical methods and are either close for simple structures or sufficiently conservative when compared to full non-linear FEA results. Each robust method models material non-linearities and hence evaluates good estimates of a non-linear limit load. Also, because the solution process is stable, convergence difficulties, encountered with full non-linear analysis, are avoided. Limit loads can be evaluated in a cost effective manner, which is particularly attractive at the initial stages of design...|$|R
