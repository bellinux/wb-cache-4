5|$|Whisked {{away from}} her home and her beloved, Sue is in despair until Hal appears outside her window with a ladder. The {{attempted}} elopement fails when the mistress catches Hal in the act and dismisses him. She awaits Sue to descend and round the corner before halting her and forcing her back inside. The father pulls up {{to a place of}} business and Hal, who is walking by, attempts to greet the father. The angry father ignores him, but Hal <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the wigmaker's store next to him. An idea strikes him and he pays a photographer to get a photo of the father on the way out, which further angers him. Hal then sends a message to Sue, that he will come and claim her the following day, disguised as her father.|$|E
25|$|Lantern (Shadows): In the meantime, the Court Jester and the Twin Brother {{have taken}} refuge in a cave. The Jester gently tries to nurse the Twin Brother's wounds. To {{distract}} {{him from his}} pain and fear, the Jester teaches the Twin Brother the art of shadow puppets. This beautiful moment is spoiled by the archers, who, watching at a distance, plot their capture of the two. The Jester hears a sound and investigates, leaving Twin Brother alone. The Twin Brother <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> {{the face of the}} Chief Archer's Daughter. Their eyes meet but are interrupted as the Archers leap out and capture him. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches helplessly as the Twin Brother is carried away.|$|E
6000|$|... [STRANGWAY {{has come}} in noiselessly, and is {{standing}} just behind [...] her. She <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> him. There is something so still, so [...] startlingly still in his figure and white face, that she cannot [...] for the moment fond her voice.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nit," [...] she curtly replied; [...] "you rest up, and we'll go to-morrow night. We {{might take}} another <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the town by {{electric}} light; you could kind o' lean {{back in the}} car and take it easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet {{is there}} life in that I make,-- [...] Oh Thou who knowest, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>see,</b> [...] As Thou hast power over me, [...] So I have power over these, [...] Because I wrought them for Thy sake, [...] And breathed in them mine agonies.|$|R
6000|$|A {{string of}} covered waggons passes by. I <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> {{a number of}} men sitting inside and looking almost as cheerful as a beanfeast in Epping Forest. They make facetious gestures. They have a subdued sing-song going on. But one of them looks a little sick, and then I notice not very {{obtrusive}} bandages. [...] "Sitting-up cases," [...] my guide explains.|$|R
6000|$|Werner (<b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> him). A curse upon thee, stranger! [...] Where dids't thou learn a tone so like my boy's? [...] 110 [...] Thou mock bird of my hopes--a curse upon thee! [...] Out! Out! I say. Thou {{shalt not}} harbour here.|$|E
6000|$|Ind. Oh, dismal day! Fate, thou hast ravished my {{last hope}} away! [...] [She <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> AURENG-ZEBE {{standing}} [...] by her, and starts. O heaven! my Aureng-Zebe--What strange surprise! Or does my willing mind delude my eyes, And shows the figure always present there? Or liv'st thou? am I blessed, and see thee here? ...|$|E
6000|$|THE OFFICER. (impatiently, {{coming back}} into the room). Your {{neighbours}} have their heads so full of runaway Servians that they see them everywhere. (Politely.) Gracious lady, a thousand pardons. Good-night. (Military bow, which Raina returns coldly. Another to Catherine, who follows him out. Raina closes the shutters. She <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Louka, who has been watching the scene curiously.) ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>turns</b> quickly <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the rector. She instinctively {{switches}} at her Gozzoli fringe {{with her}} fingers, but gives {{it up as}} hopeless.|$|R
60|$|Ring growled {{and sniffed}} the keen air and bristled. Venters {{clutched}} at his rifle. Whitie sometimes made a mistake, but Ring never. The dull thud of hoofs almost deprived Venters {{of power to}} <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> from where disaster threatened. He felt his eyes dilate {{as he stared at}} Lassiter leading Black Star and Night out of the sage, with Jane Withersteen, in rider's costume, close beside them.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's no how astonishing. She was the last," [...] he said. [...] "Hadn't {{you better}} <b>turn</b> over, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if there's {{any more of}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|IDONEA [...] I {{have nothing}} [...] To do with others; {{help me to}} my Father-- [...] [She <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> MARMADUKE leaning on ELEANOR--throws herself [...] upon his neck, and after some time,] [...] In joy I met thee, but a few hours past; [...] And thus we meet again; one human stay [...] Is left me still in thee. Nay, shake not so.|$|E
6000|$|Here are the hussars. How {{much more}} they carry to battle than at [...] reviews. The hay in those great nets must {{encumber}} them. [She [...] <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> {{that her daughter}} has become pale.] Ah, now I know! [...] HE has just gone by. You exchanged signals with him, you wicked [...] girl! How {{do you know what}} his character is, or if he'll ever come [...] back? ...|$|E
6000|$|LONG--Yer'll see 'em in arf a mo', {{when that}} church lets out. [He <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the window {{display in the}} two stores for the first time.] Blimey! Look at that, will yer? [They both walk back and stand looking in the jewelers. Long flies into a fury.] Just look at this 'ere bloomin' mess! Just look at it! Look at the bleedin' prices on 'em--more'n our 'old bloody stokehole makes in ten voyages sweatin' in 'ell! And they--her and her bloody clarss--buys 'em for toys to dangle on 'em! One of these 'ere would buy scoff for a starvin' family for a year! ...|$|E
5000|$|On expressways {{where there}} are many sharp <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> curves, <b>seen</b> {{especially}} in the largest cities, a yellow line indicates no passing between lanes, as follows: ...|$|R

60|$|I didn't {{know what}} time it was, but it seemed as if it must be getting on into the afternoon; and feeling that my deer hunt was over, I thought I had better lose no time in hunting up Jone, so I {{followed}} on after the men and the dogs, who was going to the main road, but keeping a little back of them, though, for I didn't know what the older one might do if he happened to <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> me.|$|R
60|$|Bill <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the boy, {{and loses}} his {{complexion}} {{and sits down}} plump on the round and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks. For an hour I was afraid for his mind. And then I told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately {{and that we would}} get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old Dorset fell in with our proposition. So Bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the Russian in a Japanese war with him is soon as he felt a little better.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (brusquely). Get up, get up. (He turns moodily {{away and}} takes a turn across the room, pausing {{for a moment to}} say, over his shoulder) You're talking nonsense; and you know it. (She gets up and sits down in almost {{listless}} despair on the couch. When he <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> her there, he feels that his victory is complete, and that he may now indulge in a little play with his victim. He comes back and sits beside her. She looks alarmed and moves a little away from him; but a ray of rallying hope beams from her eye. He begins like a man enjoying some secret joke.) How do you know I am a brave man? ...|$|E
5000|$|Later, {{when the}} Deputy {{is in his}} motel room packing his things, he <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the ham radio. Children's voices are heard saying [...] "It's the kids, he gets the kids!". As a young girl's voice whispers [...] "Deputy", Bughuul appears and the scene cuts to black.|$|E
60|$|I <b>turn</b> my head, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> it, in its {{beautiful}} serenity, beside me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon a Frenchman's got {{his little}} standby for a dull time, too; because when all other {{interests}} fail, he can <b>turn</b> in <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if he can't {{find out who}} his father was." ...|$|R

50|$|John 20:14 is {{the fourteenth}} verse {{of the twentieth}} chapter of the Gospel of John in the Bible. In this verse, Mary Magdalene has just {{finished}} speaking to the angels she found in Jesus's empty tomb. She then <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the resurrected Jesus, but fails to recognize him. In the Gospel of John, {{this is the first}} moment anyone sees Jesus after his resurrection.|$|E
5000|$|He <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> his friend, who {{has finally}} become {{reconciled}} to him, having decided {{to visit the}} altar to honour not her own Dead but Stransom's. Stransom, dying, tries {{to tell her that}} he is ready to add a candle for Hague, but is able only to say [...] "One more, just one more". The story ends with his face showing [...] "the whiteness of death." [...] Thus Stransom's last words are rendered ambiguous.|$|E
50|$|Back at the project, Philpot visits Colonel Nelson in her room, {{where she}} is taking doses of uppers to stay focued. He {{questions}} the wisdom of letting Roper into the lab, a man with whom Philpot claims to have had some experience. After a brief argument, Philpot decides he cannot and will not let Roper into the project. Colonel Nelson seems to relent when, behind Philpot, a video monitor comes on, displaying Roper's face as he stands outside. Philpot <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> this, when the Colonel shoves {{his head into the}} monitor, knocking him unconscious.|$|E
6000|$|Lo, I have wrought {{in common}} clay [...] Rude figures of a {{rough-hewn}} race; [...] For Pearls strew not the market-place [...] In this my town of banishment, [...] Where with the shifting dust I play [...] And eat the bread of Discontent. [...] Yet is there life in that I make,-- [...] Oh, Thou who knowest, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> [...] As Thou hast power over me, [...] So have I power over these, [...] Because I wrought them for Thy sake, [...] And breathe in them mine agonies.|$|R
50|$|The episode {{ends with}} Alaric having {{a drink at}} the bar when a {{familiar}} voice greets him. Alaric does not look surprised to hear it, <b>turns</b> around <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Isobel (Mia Kirshner) {{standing in front of}} him.|$|R

50|$|The Pinkertons arrive {{looking for}} Bill, and Garrett tells them {{a secret that}} Bill is Murphy. Bill tells the Pinkertons that there's some women and {{children}} lock in the bank safe inside. As the Pinkertons go inside to get {{the women and children}} out, Bill, Will, Garrett, Jane, and Josiah steal their horses. Bill rides off west, and the others ride off to Lincoln. The Pinkertons start shooting at their escapers and Ms. Murphy finds her fathers' gold watch. She <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Bill on his horse in the sunset.|$|E
50|$|When {{the young}} gardener, Josh comes the {{following}} day asking after Mrs. Brown, Linda, concealing a kitchen knife behind her back tells him that she is down in the cellar. Paula has escaped from her room and witnesses the ensuing scene. Josh tells Linda to ask Mrs. Brown {{to get in touch}} with him before leaving the house. Linda shuts the door behind him, allowing Paula to see the knife behind her back. Linda <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Paula on the stairs and the terrified Paula flees back to her room, locking Linda out.|$|E
50|$|When {{they return}} from the mountain, Howard has arrived early and happens to see them {{disembarking}} the boat together. As {{he goes to the}} couple's suite, he notices the porter taking Steven's suitcase from the adjoining room and is filled with suspicion. His pride is further hurt when Mary rushes by him to the terrace, not realising he is there, to wave goodbye enthusiastically to Steven. He storms out when Mary <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> him, her feelings revealed on her face, and soon files for divorce against her, alleging adultery.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have many}} reasons for going wonder-ways: to make my winter chair free from spleen--to enlarge my vision--to escape disquisitions on Poetry and Kingston Criticism; to promote {{digestion}} and economise shoe-leather. I'll have leather buttons and belt; and, if Brown holds his mind, over the Hills we go. If my Books will help me to it, then will I take all Europe in <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the Kingdoms of the Earth and the glory of them. Tom is getting better, he hopes you may meet him at the top o' the hill. My Love to your nurses. I am ever ...|$|R
