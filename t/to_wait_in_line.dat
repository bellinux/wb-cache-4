5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for the game.|$|E
25|$|T. Keith Glennan {{had been}} {{appointed}} the first Administrator of NASA, with Hugh L. Dryden (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at {{the creation of the}} agency on October 1, 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA's Space Task Group, and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program. Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a retrorocket system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and landing on water. To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built. In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the U.S. space program an overly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the Defense Production Act), which meant that Mercury had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, {{a little more than a}} year and a half after Sputnik was launched.|$|E
500|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Yonkers", Tyler, The Creator disparages {{numerous}} artists, including Bruno Mars. Tyler also disparages Mars in The Game's song [...] "Martians vs. Goblins", {{in which he}} and Lil Wayne are featured artists. Mars, {{in response to the}} verse [...] "stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus," [...] said [...] " [...] has <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> if he wants to stab me... definitely not the first guy that's said something like that to me and he's {{not going to be the}} last". On April 24, 2015, Tyler admitted to being wrong regarding Mars' talent and pointed to Mars performance of [...] "Gorilla" [...] at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards as evidence.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Railways {{estimated}} that 340 million passengers would take trains during the 2009 Chunyun period. However, the average daily {{capacity of the}} Chinese railway system is 3.4 million. The shortage of railway resources led many passengers to pay double or even triple-priced tickets from scalpers or <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> for up <b>to</b> a day at railway stations.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{club members}} have also {{performed}} bouncer services {{at times in}} biker bars. This can occur for several reasons, such as to protect their members or to prevent various conflicts from occurring or escalating. Sometimes club members work in unison with bouncer staff in bars, and sometimes club members are paid employees as part-time bouncers. Additionally, club members sometimes receive preferential service by bar staff, such as not having <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> get inside of a crowded bar while non-club members <b>wait</b> outside <b>in</b> a queue.|$|R
50|$|One Friday then-President Ronald Reagan {{placed a}} call to then retired U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, who {{happened}} <b>to</b> be <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for a table. After the President’s call had ended, Senator Johnston graciously returned to his position <b>in</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
500|$|Perry's {{announcer}} on the broadcasts, Frank Gallop, {{became a}} foil for Como's jokes. When {{the television show}} began, {{there was not enough}} room for Gallop to appear on stage; he was an invisible [...] "voice from the clouds" [...] until the show's 1958 – 1959 season. There was as much fun at rehearsals as on the show itself. Como's relaxed and fun-loving manner at rehearsals put many nervous guests at ease. It was common for Como to leave the Saturday afternoon rehearsal for about a half-hour to go to confession. He managed to save some time by asking his music publisher, Mickey Glass, <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for him at the confessional. Glass, who was Jewish, was most agreeable to this, but wondered what to do if his turn came before Como arrived.|$|E
500|$|The {{police were}} to {{transport}} the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for about 15minutes. Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, {{but they did not}} leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: [...] "Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Incred-O-Dome, (1981–1997), an OMNIMAX-style theater where viewers {{could go}} on a virtual ride of, among other things, the Orient Express coaster. This appealed to {{visitors}} {{who did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> or experience the real ride, as well as those with physical conditions which would prevent them from riding at all. The show was presented less than [...] away from the actual ride.|$|E
50|$|On May 10, 2010, the Philippines had {{its first}} presidential {{election}} using electronic voting. Comelec reported that only 400 of the 82,000 machines malfunctioned. Most voter complaints were related <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> long <b>lines</b> and learning the new technology.|$|R
50|$|Employee Assistance Programs {{would see}} a {{significant}} shift during the economic crisis of the 1980s. During this time, the government was forced to create cutbacks for programs. This would cause for mental health public agencies, treatment centers, and private counseling firms to survive by partnering with industry wanting to enter the EAP field. This though would also cause {{the effectiveness of the}} programs to come into question. The cutbacks began to affect the training of the EAP specialist and their effectiveness. The situations of workers also began to change at this time. People were also having <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines,</b> and were having to search for work due to the crisis.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, RD was {{published}} twice a week, but was later {{converted to a}} daily newspaper. The circulation of the paper was in the beginning around 70-100 thousand copies, while people interested in the newspaper had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> get a copy. Its 2005 circulation was 10,000 copies, making it the third most read daily in the country. In the first numbers RD oriented {{to the values of}} freedom, democracy, free market and anti-self-understanding. There were left pages to former politically persecuted and former owners, who by this action got {{for the first time in}} history a voice in the country.|$|R

[...] After the mutiny, the administration at USP Atlanta declared Jerry Myles to be incorrigible and a danger to the security of their prison. [...] They determined that their facilities were insufficient to fully monitor Myles' activities, so on 8 May 1945 they transferred him to the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{writes that}} Kastner had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> {{for two hours}} in the Agency's office on Erzsébet Boulevard, among scores of Jewish {{refugees}} desperate {{to find a way}} to escape to Palestine. He eventually barged past Krausz's secretaries and into his office. Krausz explained that he was determined not to alienate the British, which meant that every entry visa had to be legitimate and properly processed, which was consuming all his time. Kastner offered to help, but Krausz wasn't interested. Porter writes that Krausz took an instant dislike to the [...] "forceful, loud, and insistent Kastner." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Paris omnibus {{was painted}} in yellow, green or brown. It carried {{fourteen}} passengers on two long benches and was entered from the rear. [...] It was pulled by two horses and {{was equipped with}} a driver and conductor dressed in royal blue uniforms with silver-plated buttons, decorated with the gothic letter O, and a black necktie. [...] The conductor wore a kepi and the driver a hat of varnished leather. In summer, they wore blue and white striped trousers and black straw hats. The omnibus was required to stop any time a passenger wanted to get on or off, but with time, the omnibus became so popular that passengers had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> to get a seat.|$|E

5000|$|Hot Doug's was a Chicago, Illinois-based {{restaurant}} {{specializing in}} a variety of hot dogs and sausages. The self-proclaimed [...] "Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium" [...] was in its second location at 3324 North California Avenue in the city's Avondale neighborhood before it closed on October 3, 2014. Its first location, on Roscoe Street, closed after a 2004 fire. Hot Doug's was frequently featured in local and national media for its unique menu, and its purveyor and head chef, Doug Sohn, has been noted for his work to create affordable gourmet food. The restaurant was an extremely popular dining destination among both locals and tourists, and at lunch time and throughout much of the weekend customers could expect <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> sometimes exceeding an hour just to get in the door.|$|R

Their egg dishes are made using double yolk eggs, which they claim makes the eggs larger and fluffier.|$|R
2500|$|When drafted, Jones was on {{probation}} for a fight in West Virginia. He encountered more legal trouble before playing a down for the Titans. [...] On July 14, 2005, Jones was arrested on charges of assault and felony vandalism stemming from a nightclub altercation in Nashville. On September 5, 2005, Jones was a guest at the annual Nashville Sports Council Kickoff Luncheon. After a loud verbal tantrum {{in which he was}} told <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for his vehicle, Jones was counseled by the police. He refused to pay for any valet services used that evening, because he did not have money. Subsequently, the State of West Virginia filed a petition alleging that Jones had not made regular and sufficient contact with his probation office or reported his July arrest in a timely fashion. The court ordered the probation extended for 90 days, although the state requested it to be extended one year.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} two years of the game, there was an in-park quest program which {{permitted}} players to earn special in-game prizes at Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts.

5000|$|As {{part of his}} {{strategy}} of food security Chávez started a national chain of supermarkets, the Mercal network, which had 16,600 outlets and 85,000 employees that distributed food at highly discounted prices, and ran 6000 soup kitchens throughout the country. Simultaneously Chávez expropriated many private supermarkets. According to Commerce Minister Richard Canan, [...] "The average savings for the basic food bundle (at the Mercal Bicentennial markets) is around 30%. There are some products, for example cheese and meat, which reach a savings of 50 to 60% compared with capitalist markets." [...] The Mercal network was criticized by some commentators as {{being a part of}} Chávez's strategy to brand himself as a provider of cheap food, and the shops feature his picture prominently. The Mercal network was also subject to frequent scarcities of basic staples such as meat, milk and sugar - and when scarce products arrived, shoppers had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Performances on the {{boulevard}} began at 6 o'clock, but spectators began lining up outside several hours before. The popularity {{of an actor}} or theater {{was measured by the}} length of the line outside. [...] Street merchants sold oranges, bouquets of flowers, baked apples and ice cream <b>to</b> those <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Some spectators, particularly students, obtained discounted tickets by serving as part of the claque, applauding furiously when signalled by a theatre employee.|$|R

5000|$|Consumers Distributing {{was plagued}} by the {{perception}} that items were frequently out of stock due to the catalogue shopping nature of the store. With the catalogue concept, the customer selected the item either at home while looking through the company's catalogue, or {{by a group of}} catalogues in the showroom of every store. It was not uncommon for a customer <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> only to be told by a clerk that the merchandise was not in stock. In 1984, a concept called the [...] "Flashboard" [...] was introduced. The Flashboard was a steel bulletin board with magnetic catalogue numbers for out of stock items. Customers were able to look at the Flashboard for their item and if it was listed, they knew that it was out of stock and they did not have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>line.</b> This concept was used in some New York and New Jersey stores before computerization became mainstream.|$|E

[...] Each camp was intended to be self-sufficient, and Manzanar was no exception. Cooperatives operated various services, such as the camp newspaper, beauty and barber shops, shoe repair, and more. In addition, incarcerees raised chickens, hogs, and vegetables, and cultivated the existing orchards for fruit. Incarcerees made their own soy sauce and tofu.|$|R

50|$|The UK miners' {{strike and}} the {{disintegration}} of community that followed because of the suffering the miners and their families had to endure {{are central to the}} plot.

Instead of just examining the effects upon the communities, however, McDermid also explores the characters' emotions during the two periods examined. One reviewer pointed to McDermid's childhood in Fife as the reason she was so good at depicting the effects of the strike.|$|R
