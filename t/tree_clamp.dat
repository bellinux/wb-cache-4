5000|$|Clip-ons â€” popular on sport bikes, {{in which}} two {{separate}} short handles are clamped directly to the fork tubes. These may be fitted above or below the triple tree, and are easily adjustable. These two piece clip-on bars may also {{be attached to the}} top triple <b>tree</b> <b>clamp</b> and non adjustable.|$|E
5000|$|Scott {{produced}} a motorcycle with telescopic forks in 1908, and {{would continue to}} use them until 1931. In 1935 BMW became the first manufacturer to produce a motorcycle with hydraulically damped telescopic forks. Most motorcycles today use telescopic forks for the front suspension. The forks can be most easily understood as simply large hydraulic shock absorbers with internal coil springs. They allow the front wheel to react to imperfections in the road while isolating {{the rest of the}} motorcycle from that motion.The top of the forks are connected to the motorcycles frame in a triple <b>tree</b> <b>clamp</b> (known as a [...] "yoke" [...] in the UK), which allows the forks to be turned in order to steer the motorcycle. The bottom of the forks is connected to the front wheels axle.|$|E
25|$|For larger specimens, or {{species with}} stiffer wood, bonsai artists also use {{mechanical}} devices for shaping trunks and branches. The most common are screw-based clamps, which can straighten or bend {{a part of}} the bonsai using much greater force than wiring can supply. To prevent damage to the <b>tree,</b> the <b>clamps</b> are tightened {{a little at a time}} and make their changes over a period of months or years.|$|R
60|$|Landing at the quay, in {{the midst}} of confusion, Hector smiled at the Doctor's {{innocent}} proposal of walking, and bestowed him in a little carriage, with a horse whose hard-worked patience was soon called out, as up and up they went, through the narrow, but lively street, past the old-fashioned inn, made memorable by a dinner of George III.; past the fossil <b>tree,</b> <b>clamped</b> against a house like a vine; past heaps of slabs ready for transport, a church perched up high on the slope, and a parsonage in a place that looked only accessible to goats. Lines of fortification began to reveal themselves, and the Doctor thought himself arrived, but he was to wind further on, and be more struck with the dreariness and inhospitality of the rugged rock, almost bare of vegetation, the very trees of stone, and older than our creation; the melancholy late ripening harvest within stone walls, the whole surface furrowed by stern rents and crevices riven by nature, or cut into greater harshness by the quarries hewn by man. The grave strangeness of the region almost marked it out for a place of expiation, like the mountain rising desolate from the sea, where Dante placed his prisoners of hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I fancied when I {{first heard}} it," [...] I said casually, {{and went out}} up the hill under {{sunshine}} that filled the heart and trees, that filled the eye with joy. You know the unadulterated pleasure of that first clear morning in the Hills when a month's solid idleness lies before the loafer, and {{the scent of the}} deodars mixes with the scent of the meditative cigar. That was my portion when I stepped through the violet-studded long grass into forgotten little Japanese cemeteries--all broken pillars and lichened tablets--till I found, under a cut in the hillside, the big bell of Kioto--twenty feet of green bronze hung inside a fantastically roofed shed of wooden beams. A beam, by the way, is a beam in Japan; anything under a foot thick is a stick. These beams were the best parts of big <b>trees,</b> <b>clamped</b> with bronze and iron. A knuckle rapped lightly on the lip of the bell--it was not more than five feet from the ground--made the great monster breathe heavily, and the blow of a stick started a hundred shrill-voiced echoes round the darkness of its dome. At one side, guyed by half a dozen small hawsers, hung a battering-ram, a twelve-foot spar bound with iron, its nose pointing full-butt at a chrysanthemum in high relief on the belly of the bell. Then, by special favour of Providence, which always looks after the idle, they began to sound sixty strokes. Half a dozen men swung the ram back and forth with shoutings and outcries, till it had gathered sufficient way, and the loosened ropes let it hurl itself against the chrysanthemum. The boom of the smitten bronze was swallowed up by the earth below and the hillside behind, so that its volume was not proportionate {{to the size of the}} bell, exactly as the men had said. An English ringer would have made thrice as much of it. But then he would have lost the crawling jar that ran through rock-stone and pine for twenty yards round, that beat through the body of the listener and died away under his feet like the shock of a distant blasting. I endured twenty strokes and removed myself, not in the least ashamed of mistaking the sound for an earthquake. Many times since I have heard the bell speak when I was far off. It says B-r-r-r very deep down in its throat, but when you have once caught the noise you will never forget it. And so much for the big bell of Kioto.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of hepatic resections performed. The aim of this review was to assess available techniques for liver resection and their application. METHODS: A literature review was performed based on a Medline search to identify articles on liver resection. Keywords included liver resection, liver neoplasm, cancer, colorectal metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma. RESULTS: Improved understanding of the segmental anatomy of the liver has resulted in the evolution of liver resection. The development of new approaches to the biliovascular <b>tree,</b> combined with <b>clamping</b> to produce ischaemic demarcation, has been important in demonstrating segmental boundaries for resection. The combination of methods of vascular control such as the Pringle manoeuvre and techniques of parenchymal resection such as ultrasonic dissection allows hepatic resection with minimal blood loss and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Application of refined techniques for liver resection by specialised units allows liver resection to be performed on both normal and cirrhotic livers with low morbidity and mortality...|$|R
