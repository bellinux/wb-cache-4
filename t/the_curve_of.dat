Soon after passing I-35, SH-32 forms a brief concurrency with US-77, and passes through Marietta. East of town, the route comes to a junction with SH-77S (one of SH-77S's four termini). SH-32 continues east, following <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Lake Texoma's shoreline, passing through Lebanon. The highway then intersects with SH-99C.|$|E

5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. <b>The</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E

The motte is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> the Chilton.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop running through St. Ignace. The loop starts at exit344 on I-75 as the continuation of US Highway2 (US2) into downtown. The highway carries the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT). It runs along a four-lane roadway {{on the north side}} of Straits State Park and curves northward into downtown St. Ignace along State Street. BL I-75 and three lanes and runs along the lakefront past the marina and docks for Mackinac Island ferry services. It widens back to four lanes to follow <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> East Moran Bay and then turns inland past several hotels situated on a point jutting into the bay. North of the point, BL I-75 follows the Lake Huron shoreline past the Mackinac County Airport. North of the airport, the adjacent properties are primarily residential with a few tourist-oriented businesses. The business loop intersects County Road H-63 (Mackinac Trail) and comes to an end near Castle Rock at exit348 on I-75 in St. Ignace Township. On average each day in 2013, 4,327vehicles use the business loop near the northern I-75 interchange, and 8,819vehicles do so near the southern I-75 interchange, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E

25|$|Typical fission events release {{about two}} hundred million eV (200MeV) of energy for each fission event. The exact isotope which is fissioned, {{and whether or not}} it is {{fissionable}} or fissile, has only a small impact on the amount of energy released. This can be easily seen by examining <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> binding energy (image below), and noting that the average binding energy of the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium is around 7.6 MeV per nucleon. Looking further left on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> binding energy, where the fission products cluster, it is easily observed that the binding energy of the fission products tends to center around 8.5 MeV per nucleon. Thus, in any fission event of an isotope in the actinide's range of mass, roughly 0.9 MeV is released per nucleon of the starting element. The fission of U235 by a slow neutron yields nearly identical energy to the fission of U238 by a fast neutron. This energy release profile holds true for thorium and the various minor actinides as well.|$|E
