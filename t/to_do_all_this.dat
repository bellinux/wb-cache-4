It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair, and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting {{of the rest of the}} main cast from the film had been secured. Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances. Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio, and said that [...] "it was nice to be able to play the character and not have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> physical stuff".|$|E

Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: [...] "Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work". As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: [...] "He has a {{cerebral}} haemorrhage. He will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move". But then he reflected: [...] "He has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this.</b> If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body".|$|E
2500|$|Eckford {{extended}} extensive {{credit to}} the United States Government during the war, going bankrupt in the process because of difficulty the government had in paying him, although he never doubted that it eventually would. His efforts, {{along with those of}} Adam and Noah Brown, were key to American success on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Chauncey wrote in praise of Eckford to Secretary of the Navy William Jones on 8 October 1813, saying, [...] "...yet as Mr. Eckford has built 4 vessels at this place, and has become acquainted with the resources and people of this part of the country, I think that he could have built sooner and perhaps cheaper than perhaps any other man, and as to his talents as a ship carpenter, I am bold {{to say that there is}} not his equal in the United States, or perhaps the world. His exertions are unexampled...," [...] and in a letter of 15 January 1814, Jones replied, [...] "The talents and zeal of Mr. Eckford the builder, is a source of great satisfaction and confidence, which assures me that though the enemy has made great progress in the building of his two largest vessels, he will be over taken and surpassed in this branch of service by the superior energy and judgment of Mr. Eckford." [...] In the words of maritime historian Howard I. Chapelle, [...] "It was Eckford's extraordinary ability to design, lay down, and build ships, ranging in size from a very small schooner to the largest frigates, working in a wilderness and in severe winter weather with sick or dissatisfied labor, and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> in extremely short periods of time, that maintained American superiority on Lake Ontario." [...] Chapelle continues, [...] "From a naval shipbuilding point of view, the outstanding men of the War of 1812 were Eckford and the Browns, Adam and Noah. Through the efforts of these three, the [...] Navy held control of the lakes and prevented the British from invading the North and Northwest ... No officer or constructor of the Navy accomplished more. There were no competitors to the Browns and Eckford among the navy yards, or in the contract shipyards along the coasts, [...] on the lakes... building was made infinitely more difficult than on the coast because of climate and geographical conditions, to say nothing of scarcities of labor and some materials." [...] One advantage Eckford and the Browns may have had was a lack of attention by US government officials to their activities; Federal officials focused their efforts on the coasts, where they greatly interfered with shipbuilding decisions and progress during the war.|$|E
