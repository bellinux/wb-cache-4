He re-assembles the former crew, including Spock, and sets out to intercept the alien. As they approach the entity, it transports a humanoid probe on board the Enterprise that takes a variety of forms—including that of Jesus. The crew determine that the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development. The being is malfunctioning; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension.|$|E
5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E

40|$|Many low-income, {{minority}} students are performing poorly in American schools (Gay, 2000). Two problems {{that contribute to}} {{minority students}} 2 ̆ 7 poor academic performance are teachers 2 ̆ 7 negative perceptions of and instructional disconnection between their low-income, minority students 2 ̆ 7 home lives and community experiences (Cagle, 1998; Sternberg, 2006). Culturally responsive training {{has the potential to}} ameliorate teachers 2 ̆ 7 negative perceptions in these areas (Ginsberg, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2005; Villegas 2 ̆ 6 Lucas, 2002). ^ This study investigated the influence that culturally responsive training had on teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy perceptions and instructional strategies with respect <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>their</b> low-income, minority students (Ashton 2 ̆ 6 Webb, 1986; Ginsberg, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2005). The research questions were the following: (1) How does culturally responsive training influence elementary and middle school teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy perceptions with respect <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>their</b> low-income, minority students?, (2) How does culturally responsive training influence a change in elementary and middle school teachers 2 ̆ 7 instructional strategies concerning their low-income, minority students?, and (3) Is there a significant difference between elementary and middle school teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy with respect <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>their</b> low-income, minority students?^ A type II single-case, embedded case study design was used (Yin, 2003). The purposeful sample of N= 35 teachers, n= 20 elementary and n= 15 middle school participated in the study. The data were gathered and triangulated for corroboration purposes using the following strategies: questionnaires, document analysis, and interviews (Yin,). The questionnaires used a 5 -point Likert agreement scale. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used to analyze the questionnaire data (Gall et al., 2007). Hodder 2 ̆ 7 s (2003) material culture strategy was employed to analyze teacher lesson plans, and Rubin and Rubin 2 ̆ 7 s (2005) coding strategy was used in the analysis of the teacher interview typescripts. ^ Findings indicated that culturally responsive training did not influence teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy or instructional strategies with respect <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>their</b> low-income, minority students. It was concluded that teachers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of low-income, minority students 2 ̆ 7 home lives was essential for developing supportive accommodations <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>teaching</b> practices for these students. Further investigation of teachers 2 ̆ 7 supportive accommodations was recommended to enhance educators 2 ̆ 7 working with low-income, minority students. ...|$|R

5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|Schools {{have been}} the center of {{controversy}} over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education {{requires the use of}} both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> students how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a critical review}} on writing teacher training research and a reflection of best current practices and desirable directions for future writing teacher training. I argue that, currently, the focus {{has been placed on}} preparing writing teachers <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> aspects like vocabulary and grammar of academic prose, genre, written corrective feedback, and writing assessment. Such studies tend to emphasize on the written outputs, and ignore the writing teachers’ attitude <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> <b>their</b> educator identity, and their professional development as writing teachers. I conclude by suggesting opportunities that await these writing teacher training research programs in the future...|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} {{to try and}} fix this issue with the education system, {{but there have been}} many bumps in the road. Institutions have come across a lack of funding when trying <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the instructors the process of actually demonstrating to the students how to use the online programs. Not to mention, teachers weren't expecting all the overtime hours they would have to put in when learning the online programs in addition <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>their</b> regular classroom hours. Many of them opted out of learning the programs which leaves a huge disconnect if all the teachers aren't interested in participating.|$|R

25|$|In the Islamic conception, {{every human}} being has a {{responsibility}} towards oneself. Since human life is sacred and initially created by divine rather than human agency, people are responsible for trying to keep their bodies and souls healthy, and not causing themselves spiritual or physical harm. Consequently, sport has obvious attractions in Islam: traditions record that Muḥammad raced with his wife 'Ā'ishah, and that he encouraged parents <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> children swimming, riding and archery.

25|$|Practical {{difficulties}} included recruiting teachers {{by ethnic}} group rather than language ability. Consequently, some teachers were expected <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> ethnic language {{even if their}} ability was poor while other teachers, who could speak the ethnic language, were not recruited. Teachers who could speak the local language had no training in its structure or written form. Local languages could lack standardization and their vocabularies might be too limited to cover the curriculum. Lack of dictionaries and grammar books meant that teachers had no guide to {{the proper use of}} language and textbooks were the only written material to help students with reading. One solution to these problems has been to allow bilingual instruction and Amharic sections in some schools.|$|E
25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations.

The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E
