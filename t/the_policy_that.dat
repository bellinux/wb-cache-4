5|$|Armando Galarraga and Jim Joyce, {{along with}} Daniel Paisner, {{released}} {{a book titled}} Nobody's Perfect, chronicling their experiences {{during and after the}} game. In June 2011, one year after the near-perfect game, Major League Baseball put a rule into effect that Joyce cannot umpire any games in which Galarraga's team plays. Due to the book release, the two are now business partners, and this relationship could affect Joyce's impartiality while umpiring Galarraga's team. It is similar to <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> prevented umpire Jim Wolf from being the plate umpire in games that his younger brother Randy pitched in.|$|E

5|$|The Lafayette Leopards {{were not}} the only team to face racism in El Paso. In September 1950, a regular season game between Loyola University (Los Angeles) (now Loyola Marymount University) and the Texas College of Mines was {{cancelled}} because of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> excluded black players from playing in El Paso. Finally on October 27, 1950, officials took a vote that allowed the Texas college to include black players in games at the El Paso location. A year after the grant was passed, the Sun Bowl hosted its first integrated football game between the College of the Pacific (now University of the Pacific) and Texas Tech University.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs {{associated}} with the Order. Prior to this date it had been <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E

At the time of the release of OpenPMF version 2, model-driven security was tied together with a model-driven development process for applications, especially for agile service oriented architecture (SOA).|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the Handbook This {{handbook}} provides {{all students}} at the School of Nutrition Science and <b>Policy</b> (SNSP) with <b>the</b> rules and regulations that apply between their first registration in the SNSP and the receipt of an M. S. or Ph. D. degree. It describes the procedures, requirements, expectations, and recommended timing for completion of the M. S. and Ph. D. degrees, {{and the consequences of}} non-compliance. The student is responsible for knowing and complying with these procedures. An acknowledgment of this responsibility follows this page, and must be signed and submitted to the SNSP Office for Student Services at the time of first registration into an SNSP degree program. Policies and procedures governing degree programs are changed periodically. <b>The</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> apply at <b>the</b> time of the student's first registration in a degree program will be <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> student must follow. When a student who has received an M. S. from the SNSP is admitted to the Ph. D. program, or when a student who has withdrawn from a program is readmitted, s/he will follow <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures <b>that</b> are in effect at the time of first registration following the new admission. Students who take a leave of absence of 365 days or less will continue to follow <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> were in effect when they entered the program. Students who take a leave of absence of more than 365 days will follow <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> are in effect {{at the time of their}} first registration after the leave of absence...|$|R

She also reminded Wardlaw that the Supreme Court had several times rejected the test on which she read Wardlaw's opinion relying on, that governments must use the least intrusive method of obtaining information available {{in order to protect}} employees' Fourth Amendment rights, a rule followed by seven other circuits as well.|$|E
25|$|Along with John Graham and Theodorick Bland, Rodney was {{selected}} by President James Monroe in 1817 for a special diplomatic mission to South America, the South American Commission of 1817–1818. Rodney was appointed to lead the commission to investigate whether the newly formed South American republics should be recognized. He strongly advocated such recognition and, with Graham, published his findings in 1819 as Reports on the Present State of the United Provinces of South America. This report {{is thought to have}} contributed much to the thinking behind <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> eventually became expressed as the Monroe Doctrine. It also resulted in Rodney's 1823 appointment as United States Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, now known as Argentina.

25|$|As a {{director}} of the East India Company he spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East, contributing liberally to missionary societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages. Boyle supported <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> the Bible should be available in the vernacular language of the people. An Irish language version of the New Testament was published in 1602 but was rare in Boyle's adult life. In 1680–85 Boyle personally financed the printing of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, in Irish. In this respect, Boyle's attitude to the Irish language differed from the English Ascendancy class in Ireland at the time, which was generally hostile to the language and largely opposed the use of Irish (not only as a language of religious worship).|$|E

25|$|Patrick was not {{hostile to}} aviation, however. He {{underwent}} flight training and obtained his wings, then issued {{a series of}} reports to the War Department emphasizing the need to expand and modernize the Air Service. In his first annual report in 1922, he warned that the Air Service had been degraded by budget cuts to the degree that it could no longer meet its peacetime obligations, much less mobilize for war. In one of the Air Service's first inclusions in the army's promotion system after becoming a combatant arm, among the 669 lieutenant colonels on the 1922 candidate list for colonel, the first Air Service member (James E. Fechet) was 354th. Patrick supported and issued the first air doctrine for the service, Fundamental Conceptions (patterned on Army Training Regulation 10-5 Doctrines Principles and Methods), which outlined strategy and tactics for the air arm. Patrick was also critical of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> placed air units under the command of corps commanders and proposed that only observation squadrons {{should be part of the}} ground forces, with all combat forces centralized under the control of an air force attached to General Headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Expanding and {{improving}} secondary vocational education {{has long been}} an objective of China’s educational reformers, for vocational schools are seen as those which are best placed to address (by providing trained workers) the rising needs of the nation’s expanding economy, especially its manufacturing and industrial sectors. Without an educated and trained work force, China cannot have economic, hence social and national, development. Yet, given a finite, and often quite limited, pot of money for secondary schools, an allocation competition/conflict necessarily exists between its two sub-sectors: general education and vocational/technical education. Regardless, an over-enrollment in the latter has been the overall result of the mid-1980s reforms. Yet firms that must seek workers from this graduate pool have remained unimpressed with the quality of recruits and have had to rely on their own job-training programs that provide re-education for their newly hired workers. The public, also, has not been very enthusiastic over vocational secondary education which, unlike general education, does not lead to the possibility of higher education. The public’s perception is that these schools provide little more than a dead end for their children. Also, vocational institutions are more expensive to run than their counterparts in general education, and they have not had sufficient money to modernize their facilities, as China’s modernizing national economy demands. By mid-decade of the 21st Century, therefore, academics and policy-makers alike began to question <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>that</b> pours funds into vocational schools that do not do their intended function.|$|E
