40|$|Green {{manuring}} means <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> suitable {{crops to}} enrich the soil. Such crops may be <b>turned</b> <b>under</b> green or when ripe. Green manuring adds organic matter and, directly or indirectly, nitrogen to the soil. Leguminous crops are most desirable for green manuring, since they add to the soil nitrogen gathered from the air {{in addition to the}} organic matter which they carry. Besides the nitrogen in the legumes <b>turned</b> <b>under,</b> an additional supply of nitrogen is fixed in the soil by the action of bacteria, using the carbon in the organic matter as a source of energy. <b>Turning</b> <b>under</b> an entire crop is advised only when the soil is poor and for the purpose of starting a rotation. <b>Turning</b> <b>under</b> catch crops or winter-grown green crops is an economical and successful method of supplying nitrogen.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 48 th New Zealand Grassland Association Conference, 3 - 6 November 1986, Alexandra. Production of two rhizomatous clovers, Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum) and zigzag clover (T. medium), was assessed under a number of fertility regimes. Caucasian clover annual dry matter production was of 12 t/ha for cv. Treeline on a fertile lowland soil, 8. 5 t/ha for cv. Prairie on a moderately fertile hill country soll and 2. 5 t/ha for cv. Prairie on a low fertility high country soil. For a 30 year old stand of zigzag clover on a moderately fertile high country soil estimated DM yields ranged from 2 t/ha <b>under</b> low <b>fertiliser</b> applications to 10 t/ha <b>under</b> high <b>fertiliser</b> rates. The stand gave a 3. 2 t DM/ha response to the addition of 50 kg/ha sulphur alone. Both clovers are very persistent and appear to remain productive for several years {{in the absence of}} fertiliser applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to fill a gap in the literature on attentional focus and sports performance. Specifically, in contrast to most previous studies in which an external focus was directed at an implement, we used a gymnastics skill that did not involve the use of an implement. Furthermore, while most studies used only outcome measures of performance, we also assessed movement quality. Twelve-year-old gymnasts performed a maximum vertical jump with a 180 -degree turn while airborne, with their hands crossing in front of their chest during the <b>turn</b> <b>under</b> three different focus conditions. Under the external focus condition, participants were asked to focus on the direction in which a tape marker, which was attached to their chest, was pointing after the <b>turn.</b> <b>Under</b> the internal focus condition, they were asked to focus on the direction in which their hands were pointing after the <b>turn.</b> <b>Under</b> the control condition, no focus instructions were given. The external focus condition resulted in both superior movement form and greater jump height than did the other two conditions, which produced comparable results. The present findings show that, similar to other tasks, the performance of form-based skills can be enhanced relatively easily by appropriate external focus instructions...|$|R
