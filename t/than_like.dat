5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters <b>than</b> <b>like</b> a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E

MPR producer Tom Voegeli {{came up with the}} idea for a new show: Saint Paul Sunday Morning, with McGlaughlin as host. MPR had just received a public radio communications satellite uplink, as well as seed money to develop a few pilot shows for national distribution. Voegeli wanted a program which would present world-class musicians, in an informal live setting in MPR's new state-of-the-art studio, to a national audience. Voegeli also wanted McGlaughlin to sound like himself — a musician — rather <b>than</b> <b>like</b> a broadcaster, and to share his own intimate, animated enthusiasm with listeners.|$|E
25|$|As President, Erdoğan has overseen {{a revival}} of Ottoman tradition, {{greeting}} Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the new presidential palace, with guards dressed in costumes representing founders of 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' (Osmanlı torunu). This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term külliye to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word kampüs. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. When pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims {{and said that he}} would aim to be more like Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather <b>than</b> <b>like</b> an Ottoman sultan.|$|E

25|$|The NFL adopted {{some of the}} {{innovations}} introduced by the AFL immediately {{and a few others}} in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks {{to keep track of the}} official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the AFL <b>than</b> <b>like</b> the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.|$|E

He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather <b>than</b> <b>like</b> lumbering beasts. One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed.

500|$|The {{leaves are}} the most easily {{observed}} characteristic for the Marsileaceae; they have a long slender leaf stalk ending in zero, two, or four (occasionally six) leaflets. [...] The number of leaflets differs among the three genera and can therefore be used for identification. In Pilularia, the leaves are narrowly cylindrical and taper to a point. [...] Leaves of Regnellidium bear two broad leaflets, while leaves of Marsilea bear four leaflets at the tip. The four leaflets on the leaf of Marsilea are not borne equally. [...] Instead, they are borne in pairs with one pair of leaflets attached slightly higher than the other. [...] Thus in the developing leaf, the leaflets are folded more like {{the wings of a}} butterfly <b>than</b> <b>like</b> the leaflets of a clover.|$|E

Nadia Oxford at USgamer said that the game was [...] "a very decent re-construction of Final Fantasy Adventure" [...] and less tedious than Sword of Mana. Jason Schreier of Kotaku thought that the game was excellent; like Oxford, he preferred it over Sword of Mana, which he said felt more like a new game <b>than</b> <b>like</b> a remake. Harry Slater at Pocket Gamer, Musgrave, and Schreier all commented on the price, considering it to be high.|$|E

500|$|Though some remodelling {{work was}} done in the 13th and 14th centuries, with a {{northwest}} tower funded by Jasper Tudor, lord of Glamorgan from 1484–95, by the late 16th century the church had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1594 the bishop complained that the cathedral was [...] "more like a desolate and profane place <b>than</b> <b>like</b> a house of prayer and holy exercises". The church continued to exist in a poor state, so that by 1692 choral services had to be suspended in fear that the roof would collapse. The battlements of the northwestern tower blew away during a storm in 1703, and the southwest tower fell down in 1722. In 1734, John Wood of Bath was hired to restore the cathedral, but his work on the temple was still not complete by 1752 and remained that way. [...] It was not until 1840 that in the wake of industrial development in Cardiff that the cathedral could raise the funds to commence a full restoration.|$|E

500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came {{to him that the}} series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us <b>than</b> <b>like</b> fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E
500|$|The delays proved {{beneficial}} in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes {{so that the}} shark was only hinted at. For example, {{for much of the}} shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels. The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie, but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film's suspense. As Spielberg put it years later, [...] "The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller." [...] In another interview, he similarly declared, [...] "The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock <b>than</b> <b>like</b> Ray Harryhausen." [...] The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: [...] "The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances." ...|$|E
