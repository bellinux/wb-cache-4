25|$|The {{existence}} of resonances and small denominators led to <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> of {{stability in the}} planetary problem: do planets, in nearly circular orbits around a star, remain in stable or bounded orbits over time? In 1963, Vladimir Arnold proved using KAM theory a kind of stability of the planetary problem: there exists a set of positive measure of quasiperiodic orbits {{in the case of}} the planetary problem restricted to the plane. In the KAM theory, chaotic planetary orbits would be bounded by quasiperiodic KAM tori. Arnold's result was extended to a more general theorem by Féjoz and Herman in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Some modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} Josephus’s ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. <b>The</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> {{that they were}} addressing was whether Josephus’s quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting his own ideas and words into someone else’s mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to do just this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence indicate {{that this was not}} the case with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary.|$|E
25|$|The {{war with}} Khwarezmia also brought up <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> of succession. Genghis was not young {{when the war}} began, and he had four sons, {{all of whom were}} fierce warriors and each with their own loyal followers. Such sibling rivalry almost came to a head during the siege of Urgench, and Genghis was forced to rely on his third son, Ögedei, to finish the battle. Following the {{destruction}} of Urgench, Genghis officially selected Ögedei to be successor, as well as establishing that future Khans would come from direct descendants of previous rulers. Despite this establishment, the four sons would eventually come to blows, and those blows showed the instability of the Khanate that Genghis had created.|$|E

Kaegi concludes that scholars must also subject the Byzantine tradition to critical scrutiny, as it [...] "contains bias and cannot serve as an objective standard against which all Muslim sources may be confidently checked".|$|E
500|$|Both {{practicing}} archaeoastronomers {{and observers}} of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy {{as part of an}} archaeology informed by cultural anthropology and aimed at understanding a [...] "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology. [...] Todd Bostwick argued that [...] "archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present." [...] Paul Bahn has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology. Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations or {{as it relates to the}} political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques. [...] Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing [...] "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism" [...] Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable precursors of their discipline, and are especially concerned with <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of wrongful delegation is sometimes {{said to be}} a reflection of the Latin maxim delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot appoint another), which means that a body to which or person to whom power was delegated by Parliament cannot further delegate the power to another. Academics have submitted that the maxim does not state a rule of law, but is [...] "at most a rule of construction" [...] and in applying it to a statute [...] "there, of course must be a consideration of the language of the whole enactment and of its purposes and objects". Thus, in reality, there is no such principle as delegatus non potest delegare; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of cases but is sometimes used as a convenient label. Consequently, in most cases the courts have adopted such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern governmental agencies. For statutory powers, <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> is whether it is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A's authority by B. The maxim is merely the pencil with which the court is able to draw the line between authorized and unauthorized sub-delegation, and the courts must then ask whether statutory discretion remains {{in the hands of the}} proper authority, or whether some other person purports to exercise it. Thus where an Act said that an inspector of nuisances [...] "may procure any sample" [...] of goods for analysis, it was held that the inspector might validly send his assistant to buy a sample of coffee, as he had in no way authorized his assistant to exercise the discretion legally reposed in himself. Ultimately, the courts must decide the issue based on what Parliament has authorized according to what may be summarized as the language, scope and objects of the empowering statute.|$|E

2500|$|This {{conflict}} raised <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> of {{what happens}} when an Act of Congress conflicts with the Constitution. Marshall answered that Acts of Congress that conflict with the Constitution are not law and the Courts are bound instead to follow the Constitution, affirming the principle of judicial review. In support of this position Marshall looked {{to the nature of the}} written Constitution—there would be no point of having a written Constitution if the courts could just ignore it. [...] "To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained?" [...] Marshall also argued that the very nature of the judicial function requires courts to make this determination. Since it is a court's duty to decide cases, courts have to be able to decide what law applies to each case. Therefore, if two laws conflict with each other, a court must decide which law applies. Finally, Marshall pointed to the judge's oath requiring them to uphold the Constitution, and to the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which lists the [...] "Constitution" [...] before the [...] "laws of the United States". Part of the core of this reasoning is found in the following statements from the decision: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bennett's Victorian Images of Islam (1992) {{has been}} widely cited. [...] For example, by Kate Zebiri (1997), Rollin Armour (2003) Hugh Goddard (2000) and [...] Dana L. Robert (2008). Armour refers {{to the work of}} Bennett and of such {{scholars}} as Bernard Lewis and John Esposito as lying [...] "behind almost every page that follows" [...] (2003: xiv). David Thomas described the book as an [...] "illuminating study into an overlooked corner of Victorian religious history". In particular, it showed that more diversity of approach existed among earlier contributors but that more often than not it is a priori premises rather than encounter that determine attitude Bennett described contributors as confrontational or conciliatory, analysing the work of three scholars in each category. The three conciliators were Charles Forster, Frederick Denison Maurice and Reginald Bosworth Smith and the three confrontationalists were William Muir, William St. Clair Tisdall and John Drew Bate. Conciliators were those [...] "Western writers who questioned the prevailing attitude of cultural and religious superiority that led to a belittling of everything non-European" [...] Confrontationalists perpetuated traditional anti-Muslim polemic. Bennett later commented that while [...] "actual meetings between Christians and Muslims may result in a change of heart and mind ... more often than not ... it confirms our prejudices, which it has to be said {{is one of the biggest}} problems involved in Christian-Muslim encounter." [...] He stresses, though, that the story of Christian-Muslim encounter includes examples of harmonious co-existence as well as of hostility. By remembering these experiences we can ensure that future relations are not solely defined by a negative historical memory. [...] Ahmad Gunney called the book [...] "a valuable contribution to the debate on <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> of Islam and the West" [...] and said that [...] "the Baptist minister" [...] had to a [...] "certain extent" [...] complemented [...] "the work of three Muslim writers, M. A. Anees, Syed Z. Abedin and Z. Sardar" [...] whose book had been published by the same publisher as Bennett's. Like Thomas, Gunney remarked that Bennett's research showed that even when people are [...] "technically well equipped" [...] and spend [...] "extensive periods of residence in the countries of the world of Islam" [...] this does [...] "not necessarily lead to objective judgements, especially if one starts off, as in the case of the three confrontational writers with a priori assumptions about Islam." [...] Andrews, a Shi’a Muslim, suggested that the book's study by Muslim Imams-in-training might [...] "go some way towards breaking down barriers and misconceptions" [...] and observed that [...] "through his own enlightened position" [...] Bennett [...] "has done a lot to undermine at least one Muslim's preconceptions about Christian missionaries, and about Baptist missionaries in particular".|$|E
