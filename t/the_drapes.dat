25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of <b>the</b> <b>drapes</b> and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For <b>the</b> <b>drapes,</b> Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. <b>The</b> <b>drapes</b> were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a jacquard weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. <b>The</b> <b>drapes</b> and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Lincoln's death in 1865, the East Room {{contained}} 24 chairs, four sofas, four tables, eight sets of drapes, eight sets of lace curtains, eight mirrors, and one carpet. All the furniture was in poor shape. During his administration, {{members of the public}} attending the weekly receptions in the room had heavily vandalized the room in seeking souvenirs, ripping down portions of the wallpaper and stealing cords and tassels from <b>the</b> <b>drapes.</b> Someone even cut a square yard from one of the damask drapes. Others took scissors and knives to the carpet, gouging the oak floor beneath, and gilded ornaments were stolen from the mantels.|$|E
25|$|Despite this redecoration, the East Room was {{nonetheless}} somewhat shabby by 1861. On April 18, 1861, about 60 militiamen from Kansas took up temporary {{residence in the}} East Room pending construction of barracks {{for them in the}} city. They did serious damage to the carpet, and sometimes shot bullets into the walls. Mary Todd Lincoln refurbished the room with damask drapes, lace curtains, wallpaper, and a new $2,500 carpet later that year. The wallpaper was heavy patterned velvet cloth paper from Paris in crimson, garnet, and gold, and supplied by William H. Carryl & Brother of New York. The floor covering was an Axminster carpet woven in Glasgow, Scotland. The largest loom in the world was needed to weave the carpet, which covered the entire floor. <b>The</b> <b>drapes</b> were crimson with heavy gold fringe and numerous gold tassels, while the lace curtains behind them were imported from Switzerland.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{development}} of a draping index for fabric simulation. The goal is to define and estimate <b>the</b> fabricâ€™s <b>draping</b> parameters for computer modeling. Using the definition, a methodology for determining <b>the</b> <b>draping</b> properties of <b>the</b> fabric can be obtained by analyzing the contour of a digital image of a fully <b>draped</b> fabric. <b>The</b> material parameters can be input into a physical-based cloth modeling system for draping simulation purposes. Three steps are associated with this method. The first one is a fabric draping measuring system designed to capture <b>the</b> fabric <b>draping</b> images. <b>The</b> second one is a computer simulation system adapted for simulating <b>the</b> <b>draping</b> behavior of fabric using <b>the</b> measured <b>draping</b> index. <b>The</b> third one is a correlation system, designed to relate <b>the</b> <b>draped</b> fabric images against the computer simulation result to derive <b>the</b> <b>draping</b> index. <b>The</b> <b>draping</b> Index in this thesis classifies fabrics into five categories. The main contribution of this research is to provide an effective and scientific method to determine <b>the</b> <b>draping</b> properties of any given fabric and integrate its usage into computer simulation. The method utilizes a very simple set up as compared with established methods such as Kawabata Evaluation System.

40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) model was developed to predict <b>the</b> <b>drape</b> coefficient (DC). Hanging weight, Sample diameter and the bending rigidities in warp, weft and skew directions are selected as inputs of the ANN model. The ANN developed is a multilayer perceptron using a back-propagation algorithm with one hidden layer. <b>The</b> <b>drape</b> coefficient is measured by a Cusick drape meter. Bending rigidities in different directions were calculated according to the Cantilever method. The DC obtained results show a good correlation between the experimental and the estimated ANN values.

2500|$|Silicone ring tourniquets, or {{elastic ring}} tourniquets, are {{self-contained}} mechanical devices {{that do not}} require any electricity, wires or tubes. The tourniquet comes in a variety of sizes. To determine the correct product size, the patient's limb circumference at the desired occlusion location should be measured, as well as their blood pressure to determine the best model. Once the correct model is selected, between two sterile medical personnel will be needed to apply the device. It should be noted, unlike with the pneumatic tourniquet, the silicone ring tourniquet should be applied after <b>the</b> <b>drapes</b> have been placed on the patient.

2500|$|Various {{types of}} filters have been {{developed}} to combat UV interaction with artifacts on display, and many of them can be used in conjunction with each other to reach the optimal setting for a particular collection. [...] Among the first employed were heavy drapes; a simple solution to apply only if an institution can provide employees to open and close <b>the</b> <b>drapes</b> at the appropriate times based on viewer access. [...] Many filtration devices rely on materials that absorb the UV, such as acrylic films or painted wash walls, but in doing this the materials themselves decay and the filters must be replaced. [...] A better solution is interference filters, which can be customized for the setting of intended use to reflect light at such an angle that it cancels out harmful incoming wavelengths. [...] If an interference filter is selected as the appropriate form of filtration, UV is eliminated completely and efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Fabric drape {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors which affect the graceful appearance of <b>the</b> garment. <b>The</b> <b>drape</b> coefficient is <b>the</b> widely used parameter to describe fabric drape but it needs other parameters to explain the fabric behavior. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between <b>the</b> fabric <b>drape</b> parameters such as drape coefficient, drape distance ratio, fold depth index, amplitude and number of nodes and low stress mechanical properties. Drape parameters were tested on a specially developed instrument based on a digital image processing technique and the low stress mechanical properties were tested by the Kawabata evaluation system. Then <b>the</b> <b>drape</b> parameters were predicted by constructing models using multiple regressions method and feed-forward back-propagation neural network technique.

2500|$|In the {{pre-operative}} holding area, {{the patient}} changes {{out of his}} or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details {{of his or her}} surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; <b>the</b> <b>drapes</b> are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an [...] "ether screen", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).|$|E
2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it just went on and on. <b>The</b> <b>drapes</b> man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E
2500|$|Dana {{managed to}} wash off the filth {{from the river}} before the {{dizziness}} sets in once again. This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy {{turns out to be}} Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to <b>the</b> <b>drapes</b> to get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word [...] "nigger" [...] to refer to Dana, who is black, initially upsets Dana, but then leads her to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice, Dana seeks refuge at home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free blacks who live {{on the edge of the}} plantation. Dana realizes that both Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children. At the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down the door, drag out Aliceâ€™s father, who is a slave, and whip him brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's mother when she refuses his advances. The men leave, Dana comes out of hiding, and helps Aliceâ€™s mother, only to be confronted by one of the white men, who hits her and attempts to rape her. Fearing for her life, Dana becomes dizzy and returns to 1976. Though hours have passed for her, Kevin assures her that she has only been gone for a few minutes. The next day, Kevin and Dana prepare for the possibility that she may travel back in time again by packing her a survival bag and by doing some research on black history from the books in their home library.|$|E
