5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner to give <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile {{to be able to}} think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to remove some of the wagons, giving <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E
5|$|When the CCP {{entered the}} First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the United Front {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E
5|$|Written by Peter Ling & Hazel Adair, {{this story}} {{developed}} out of plans by producer Nathan-Turner {{to create a}} sequel to the 1960s soap opera Compact, entitled Impact. When, after drafting three or four scripts for the proposed Impact, Nathan-Turner informed the pair that plans for the soap had been cancelled, the producer offered <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> write for Doctor Who {{as a form of}} compensation. A scene breakdown (whittled down from six parts to four) was commissioned on 12 July 1983, but after three months of development on the scripts, during which the story was restructured into two 45-minute episodes, it was ultimately rejected. The plot involves the disappearance of various people on Earth, which leads the Doctor and Peri to the planet Hexagora where the Doctor becomes romantically involved with Queen Zafia who is trying to save the insect race of Hexagora from destruction through a plan to infiltrate and take over Earth. It was later adapted as Hexagora by Paul Finch for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in November 2011.|$|E
