5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> get the belts and win.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy next {{entered a}} feud with Shawn Michaels {{on the night}} after Survivor Series. Kennedy claimed {{that it was time}} for Michaels to move on and let the younger wrestlers climb <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> success. At Armageddon, Michaels {{defeated}} Kennedy after Sweet Chin Music. On the December 31 episode of Raw, Kennedy and Michaels had a rematch where Kennedy pinned Michaels following his new finishing move, the Mic Check. In subsequent rematches, the two traded wins over each other.Kennedy lost a tag team match in which Michaels was involved ending the rivalry between the two.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on the ladder. This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E

25|$|The Bible {{provides}} ample {{additional material}} for mythic and mystical speculation. The prophet Ezekiel's visions in particular attracted much mystical speculation, as did Isaiah's Temple vision—Isaiah, Ch.6.

Moses' encounters with the Burning bush and God on Mount Sinai are evidence of mystical events in the Torah that form the origin of Jewish mystical beliefs.|$|E
25|$|This {{particular}} period {{ended in}} the early 1990s when those players left the club. Racing then spent several years in the second division, but retained plenty of ambition. In 2007–08, Racing finished second on <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> equally ambitious Toulon, but fell short of promotion with an extra-time loss to Mont-de-Marsan in the Pro D2 promotion playoff final. The following year saw Racing's ambitions realised with a romp to the Pro D2 crown, clinching promotion with four rounds to spare.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing his}} first five seasons {{as a small}} forward who {{occasionally}} pushed up the ground, Ablett made a permanent move to the midfield in 2007.

Geelong progressed through to the 2007 AFL Grand Final, in which they defeated Port Adelaide by a record 119 points to win their first premiership since 1963.

25|$|Del Martin {{has written}} that the Daughters of Bilitis was a feminist {{organization}} from the beginning, focusing {{on the problems of}} women as well as problems of the female homosexual; however, in the mid-1960s feminism became a much higher priority to many {{of the women in the}} organization. In 1966, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon joined the National Organization for Women, and urged readers of <b>The</b> <b>Ladder</b> <b>to</b> do the same, even reporting they got a family discount. The historian Martin Meeker points to the 1966 DOB convention that was a 10-day affair joining the DOB with the North American Conference of Homophile Organizations (NACHO) as the turning point where women's issues in the DOB began to have more importance to its members than gay issues. It was the largest convention DOB had yet organized, publicized in mass media all over San Francisco, attended by a large panel of nationally known speakers, and many of the presentations focused on topics that were exclusively male-centered.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, 19 {{members of}} Los Macheteros were indicted for offenses {{associated}} with the Wells Fargo heist. Ojeda Ríos was captured {{as part of an}} FBI operation that took place following two years of surveillance on the group. In the operation a group of 24 agents protected by bulletproof vests, entered the building where Ojeda Ríos had his residence. The agents received assistance from a group of snipers located on adjacent buildings and a helicopter. When Ojeda noticed the presence of the agents he fired a sub-machine gun at them and threatened to kill anyone that tried to reach the building's second floor. In the meanwhile Ojeda's wife Blanca Iris Serrano burned documents in the apartment's bathroom. When the agents tried to climb <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> reach the building's second floor Filiberto opened fire against them wounding one of them. At that moment one of the snipers disarmed him with a bullet giving the other agents enough time to arrest him.|$|E

25|$|North Hobart, {{then known}} as the Robins, had {{finished}} last in the TANFL in 1966 {{with a record of}} 2-16. They had recruited John Devine from the Geelong Football Club in the VFL to serve as playing coach, but the team initially continued to languish as Devine served a suspension carried over from his final VFL match. The Robins sat last with a record of 1-6-1 after eight weeks, but then turned their form around, winning nine of their remaining eleven games to finish fourth on the TANFL ladder. In the finals, they improved this record to twelve wins from fourteen games with a 5-point win over New Norfolk in the first semi-final, a 9-point win over Clarence in the southern preliminary final, and a 15-point win over Minor Premiers Glenorchy in the TANFL Grand Final. It was North Hobart's 21st TANFL premiership, and the first time a club had come from fourth on <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> win the flag. In the State Preliminary Final at North Hobart Oval, the Robins hosted first-time NFTA Premiers, East Launceston (who had also come from last place in 1966 to win their flag), and were comfortable winners by 51 points.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the DOB disbanded due to {{organizational}} problems, disagreements about aligning {{themselves with}} homophile organizations composed predominantly of gay men, {{and supporting the}} growing feminist movement. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon had joined the National Organization for Women and encouraged readers of <b>The</b> <b>Ladder</b> <b>to</b> do the same. Younger members who were sparked by more confrontational methods of protest, {{did not agree with}} some of the older members' ideas. Concerned that the magazine would be lost {{due to the lack of}} direction in the national organization, DOB president Rita LaPorte took possession of the 3,800-member mailing list for The Ladder (of which there were only two copies, the subject of which was an annual article to assure women that their names were safe) to Reno without the knowledge of Martin and Lyons, and she and Barbara Grier continued to publish it until September 1972 when they ran out of funds. When The Ladder severed its ties with the DOB, the anonymous donations to assist the magazine stopped. A controversy arose between Del Martin and Phyllis Lyons, Barbara Gittings, and Helen Sandoz who maintained the mailing list was stolen, and Grier who stated taking the list was necessary to keep a dying organization alive.|$|E
25|$|Mumbai FC {{was officially}} founded at a grand launch in Mumbai on 27 June 2007. The club {{was created to}} provide Indian {{football}} another non-institutional club and to provide young aspiring footballers in the city {{a chance to show}} off their skills on a proper platform. Mumbai FC then set about their goals in which they wanted to build a strong first team, build a good youth development program which would serve as the platform in <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> the first-team for potential youngsters, build a good football culture in Mumbai, and develop the football infrastructure in Mumbai. The club started building their team straight away with the signing of Englishmen David Booth. The team then started making some major signings in Indian internationals Abhishek Yadav, Khalid Jamil, Noel Wilson, and Kalyan Chaubey along with potential youngsters Dane Pereira and Darren Caldeira. The team then added their first round of foreign players Felix Aboagye and James Dissiramah. The club then began their grassroots project in November 2007 with Aqueel Ansari being the head coach. Mumbai FC then participated in their first tournament, the Mumbai Football League Elite Division in 2007. Mumbai FC lost their match in the Mumbai Football League to RCF 2–1 with Dane Pereira scoring the first goal. Mumbai FC then won the first match in their history against Bengal Mumbai; in their second match, won 7–0 with Abhishek Yadav scoring four goals. The club then won their first-ever championship, the Abhijit Kadam Memorial Cup, in which Mumbai defeated then I-League club Vasco.
