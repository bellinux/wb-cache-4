Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he [...] "read day and night, knowing like <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> Arvidh Månsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora Åboensis, Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana, [...] Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis...." ...|$|E

60|$|Here again {{his face}} grew peaked and anxious with {{that sense of}} loss I had first seen when the Power {{snatched}} him. But this time the agony was tenfold keener. As I watched it mounted like mercury in the tube. It lighted his face from within till I thought the visibly scourged soul must leap forth naked between his jaws, unable to endure.

60|$|The {{source of}} the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen—my mind was made up to this, and I went {{straight}} to his bunk.

The damp straw of the mattress, fired from beneath and denied air, had been smouldering all the while.|$|E

60|$|I {{followed}} what I supposed {{was their}} example; and, {{getting on the}} roof, tried the shutters of each room.

Then I threw up the window and climbed in.|$|E

He {{came up to me}} in Ballarat in '75; you can see on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> here where the bullet clipped me. He tried again in '76, at Port Philip, but I got the drop on him and wounded him badly. He knifed me in '79, though, in a bar at Adelaide, and that made our account about level.

60|$|Suppose <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to rest upon a table, and a {{sovereign}} to rest upon the upturned palm, I at once acquire {{a notion of}} extension, and of the limit of that extension. The impression made by the circular piece of gold {{is quite different from}} that which would be made by a triangular, or a square, piece of the same size, and thereby I arrive at the notion of figure. Moreover, if the sovereign slides over the palm, I acquire a distinct conception of change of place or motion, and of the direction of that motion. For as the sovereign slides, it affects new nerve-endings, and gives rise to new states of consciousness. Each of them is definitely and separately localized by a reflex act of the mind, which, at the same time, becomes aware of the difference between two successive localizations; and therefore of change of place, which is motion.|$|E
