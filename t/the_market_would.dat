5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
5|$|These {{plans were}} {{extremely}} controversial. All three envisaged {{reducing the number}} of stalls from 205 to 140–160 to increase space, and all three involved splitting the market into isolated clusters of stalls, significantly altering its character and appearance. The Eastern Daily Press organised a campaign against the perceived unattractiveness of the designs, the proposed {{reduction in the number of}} stalls which would mean stallholders losing their jobs and the remaining stallholders facing rent increases to cover the difference, and the change to the character of central Norwich that such a radical redesign of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> entail. A petition of over 12,000 signatories rejecting all three proposed designs was gathered.|$|E

25|$|As long {{as natural}} gas {{supplies}} exceeded demand, these facilities remained attractive. They used an inexpensive and environmentally friendly fuel. They met immediate needs at {{only a fraction}} of the cost of large nuclear, hydro-electric or coal-powered facilities.

25|$|Lester Brown {{believes}} this problem might {{be solved by}} the government establishing a price floor for oil. A tax shift raising gas taxes is the same idea.

25|$|In 1809, {{a market}} house was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of High Street, {{on the site of the}} market cross, for the sale of poultry, eggs, butter and dairy produce. The building was demolished in 1852 along with other buildings that had fallen into disrepair. A pig market was constructed in the town in 1815 on High Street.

25|$|In 1996 a {{group of}} {{derivatives}} traders led by Olivier Doria (then head of swaps at Deutsche Bank) and Michele Faissola, contributed to {{an extension of the}} swap yield curves in all the major European currencies. Until then <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> give prices until 15 years maturities. The team extended the maturity of European yield curves up to 50 years (for the lira, French franc, Deutsche mark, Danish krone and many other currencies including the ecu). This innovation was a major contribution towards the issuance of long dated zero coupon bonds and the creation of long dated mortgages.|$|E
25|$|The first {{deaths from}} hunger {{took place in}} early 1846. In March Peel set up a {{programme}} of public works in Ireland but {{was forced to resign}} as Prime Minister on 29 June. The new Whig administration under Lord Russell, influenced by their laissez-faire belief that <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> provide the food needed then halted government food and relief works, leaving many {{hundreds of thousands of people}} without any work, money or food. Grain continued to be exported from the country. Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies. The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably. By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.|$|E

Then, in June 1967 the Six-Day War erupted, and the Suez Canal closed for years to come. This created an enormous surge in demand for tanker tonnage and the Næss group was ideally positioned with 16 large tankers available, receiving extremely good rates for its vessels.|$|R
25|$|In April 1998, when KTEN (which {{had been}} {{affiliated}} with ABC on a part-time basis since its sign-on in 1956) disaffiliated from the network, WFAA began {{serving as a}} default ABC station for areas near {{and south of the}} Red River within the adjacent Sherman-Ada market—including Gainesville, and the southern Oklahoma cities of Ardmore, Durant and Hugo—through its existing availability on most cable providers in the region (KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City served as the primary default affiliate for the northern counties of the DMA in south-central Oklahoma). However, residents in extreme North Texas could view most ABC programs that were pre-empted by KTEN via WFAA for several years beforehand, particularly after the former switched to a primary NBC affiliation in 1986 (steadily reducing ABC-provided content on its schedule to select daytime and prime time programs by 1994, when it added an additional primary affiliation with Fox). <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> regain an ABC station of its own when KTEN launched a digital subchannel affiliated with the network on May 1, 2010. Despite this, WFAA remains available on some cable providers in the southern half of the market; Cable One, however, removed the station from its Sherman and Denison systems on February 26, 2015, due to a clause in its retransmission agreement with KTEN that precluded it from carrying any other ABC stations from nearby markets.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, a new {{building}} was constructed for the El Volador market. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> be destroyed and terminated by fire in 1870. A number of major markets in Mexico City were either established or formalized during this time. In 1850, the new Mercado de San Juan, also called Iturbide, was inaugurated. The first permanent structure now known as La Merced was constructed between 1861 and 1880. This structure was built to house much of the commercial activity in the area, as well as absorb the vendors of El Volador, which had closed. At this time, the area was still along a major canal called La Viga, filled with docks to receive incoming merchandise to the city from Xochimilco, Chalco and Texcoco. By 1887, there were nine main markets in the capital. In the north, there were the Santa Catarina, Santa Ana and Guerrero markets; in the south, the Mercado de San Juan; in the east La Merced and San Lucas and in the west Dos de Abril and San Cosme. By {{the end of the}} century, these were joined by the La Lagunilla market in 1893, the Loreto Market in 1889, and Martínez de la Torre in 1895. At this time as well, more modern forms of commerce would begin to appear in Mexico, such as the establishment of department stores, led by Liverpool and Palacio de Hierro, which still exist.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} {{concerns}} expressed by local residents and historic preservationists by the successful Trump bid. Preservationists believed Trump would not respect the historic {{nature of the}} building and had almost no experience renovating historic properties but government officials said any redesign would need to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts (whose secretary signaled heavy scrutiny for any changes). Trump dismissed concerns that he lacked experience with historic buildings, pointing to his redevelopment of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Some city residents worried that Trump would block access to the clock tower. However, the National Park Service said it will retain control over the clock tower and observation deck and it will keep them open for tours. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned the financial wisdom of selecting Trump/Colony Capital, given Trump's extensive problems with bankruptcy and Colony Capital's current problems keeping its hotel properties out of receivership. Pearlstein and local hoteliers argued that <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>would</b> not support the room rates Trump wished to charge, and therefore {{would not be able to}} support the excessive amount of redevelopment money and rent Trump was paying for the property. Robert Peck, Commissioner of the General Services Administration, defended the selection, arguing that the Trump/Colony Capital bid was by far the best in terms of financial commitment, experience in renovating and managing properties, and quality of design. Peck dismissed criticism about Trump's numerous past bankruptcies, noting that these mostly concerned casinos rather than hotels.|$|E
