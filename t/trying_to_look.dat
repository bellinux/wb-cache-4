500|$|Out of Friends female characters, Monica's style {{took the}} longest to establish. InStyle wrote that Monica's {{combination}} of short, wavy hair and dark lipstick evoked [...] "a '90s take on '40s style." [...] Ashley Hoffman of Styleite believes that character initially [...] "dressed like a tourist <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a New Yorker," [...] frequently sporting jeans, overalls, and cargo shorts. With a wardrobe comprised almost equally of dresses and pants, Monica's fashion sense, much like Rachel and Phoebe's, [...] "was {{a little bit}} normcore, a little bit corporate-casual." ...|$|E

Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E

500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E

When asked about the final line of the song ("I like your beard") and where it came from, Kesha explained, [...] "I've always been into bearded dudes.

500|$|Annabella Sciorra was {{originally}} cast as Nestor’s new love interest Delores, {{a role that}} eventually went to actress Maruschka Detmers when Sciorra was forced to pull out.

Desi Arnaz, Jr. was chosen to portray his father, Desi Arnaz, in {{a scene in which}} the Castillo brothers appear on an episode of I Love Lucy. [...] In preparing for his role, Arnaz, Jr. dyed his hair black and wore an ID bracelet, ring and pin, all of which had belonged to his late father. [...] "I wasn't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> exactly like him," [...] he explained. [...] "It was more about getting his essence and mannerisms."

500|$|The {{concert was}} {{entitled}} [...] "Money Can't Buy" [...] as no tickets were {{made available for}} purchase publicly; only competition winners and guests with invitations were allowed to attend the show. Additionally, Minogue donated two tickets to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). These tickets were auctioned at a charity ball for the society's [...] "Full Stop" [...] campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald found it surprising that Minogue chose to perform in an [...] "intimate" [...] setting as she had chiefly embarked on large arena tours in the past. The newspaper felt it was similar to Madonna's decision to perform at a small show at Brixton Academy, London, in 2000. Before the show, Minogue held a media press conference and discussed the development of Money Can't Buy, saying: [...] "It's been pretty intense. I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> pretty calm {{but it has been}} an intense few weeks leading up to this. There's going to be a few old , but they're not-very-oldies.

500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester".

Kenneth Choi appears as Jim Morita, a Japanese-American member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan. About his preparation for the role, Choi said, [...] " [...] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the 'Nisei' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII. I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances." [...] Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier, a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk. JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery Falsworth, a British member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Feild called his part in the film [...] "a very physical job.

2500|$|On {{the topic}} of whether his next project would be an album or a mixtape, Lamar answered: [...] "I treat every project like it's an album anyway.

I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for an album in 2012." [...] In June 2011, Lamar released [...] "Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils)", a cut from Section.80, featuring Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA.

2500|$|His {{career success}} {{so far and}} appeal to female fans of various ages piqued {{tremendous}} interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, Time magazine cover story of him as [...] "the face of new rock." [...] It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of Wuthering Heights Heathcliff and to The Sorrows of Young Werther, and said, [...] "Taylor's use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music." [...] One of the writers described his look as [...] "a cowboy Jesus," [...] to which Taylor later replied, [...] "I thought I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like George Harrison." [...] Released in April, Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, {{a version of the}} Carole King standard [...] "You've Got a Friend" [...] (featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell), which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, [...] "Long Ago and Far Away," [...] also made the Top 40 and reached #4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The album itself reached #2 on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, Before This World, which went to #1, superseding Taylor Swift.|$|E
