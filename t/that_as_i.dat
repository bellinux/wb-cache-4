25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Rolling Stones Harrison {{commemorative}} issue, in January 2002, Mikal Gilmore recognised his {{incorporation of}} dissonance on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] {{as having been}} [...] "revolutionary in popular music" [...] in 1966. Gilmore considered this innovation to be [...] "perhaps more originally creative" [...] than the avant-garde styling that Lennon and McCartney took from Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky and incorporated into the Beatles' work over the same period. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the E79 chord that Harrison introduced in the song became [...] "one of the most legendary in the entire Beatles catalogue". Speaking in 2001, Harrison said: [...] "I'm really proud of <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> literally invented that chord … John later borrowed it on I Want You (She's So Heavy): [...] 'It's driving me mad.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|About {{three months}} since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, {{in which a}} letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by {{one or two of}} them taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I never be. The other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish I had, for <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my own {{discretion}} (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that approves his art.|$|E

2500|$|Curtis Hanson {{had read}} {{half a dozen}} of James Ellroy's books before L.A. Confidential and was drawn to its characters, not the plot. He said, [...] "What hooked me on them was <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> met them, one after the other, I didn't like them - but as I {{continued}} reading, I started to care about them." [...] Ellroy's novel also made Hanson think about Los Angeles and provided him with an opportunity to [...] "set a movie at a point in time when the whole dream of Los Angeles, from that apparently golden era of the '20s and '30s, was being bulldozed." [...] Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was originally signed to Warner Bros. to write a Viking film with director Uli Edel and then worked on an unproduced modern-day King Arthur story. Helgeland was a long-time fan of Ellroy's novels. When he heard that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to L.A. Confidential in 1990, he lobbied to script the film. However, at the time, the studio was only talking to well-known screenwriters. When he finally did get a meeting, it was canceled two days before it was to occur.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
