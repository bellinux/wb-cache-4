30|$|The {{mechanism}} of injury was one gunshot wound, six motor vehicle accidents and nine falls from height. Five fractures were Essex-Lopresti <b>tongue-type</b> injuries, while the remaining 11 injuries were joint-depression type.|$|E
30|$|Essex-Lopresti {{suggested}} if {{the secondary}} fracture line propagated {{back to the}} posterior border of the tuberosity, a tongue type occurred [7]. Conversely, if the force was behind the joint but across the body and out between the posterior facet {{and the level of}} the insertion of the tendo Achilles, then the more common joint depression-type fracture occurred. If the tuberosity is forced upwards with displacement and the primary fracture line cleaves open, this becomes a severely comminuted fracture with a potential compromise to the blood supply and avascular necrosis [7]. <b>Tongue-type</b> fractures have been associated with posterior skin breakdown, and severely displaced <b>tongue-type</b> fractures should be considered a surgical emergency [8].|$|E
30|$|Most calcaneal {{fractures}} {{are caused}} by axial loads, e.g. a fall from a height. Primary and secondary fracture lines develop. The primary fracture lines run through the posterior facet of the subtalar joint creating a superolateral fragment and a superomedial or “constant fragment” which includes the sustentaculum tali. If this force continues even further, a secondary fracture line is created and depending on {{the direction of the}} force, a <b>tongue-type</b> fracture or joint depression-type fracture will form.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This {{study is}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} know the characteristics of the learning processes in tongue-computer interaction and to obtain a useful insight to a better design of the tongue-computer interface for computer text input. <b>Tongue-typing</b> can be a good alternative to hand input methods for physically disabled individuals or tasks where hand-typing is not possible. In order to evaluate the process of typing with the tip of the tongue, eight volunteers participated in tip-of-tongue selectivity training experiments using an inductive tongue-computer interface. Performance data based on typing speed and accuracy fits a general learning model based on the power law of practice, which can be used to estimate further improvements of <b>tongue-typing</b> performance. Simulated expert typing rates predict a <b>tongue-typing</b> performance 8 times slower than normal QWERTY keyboard, but duplicate the performance of other alternative input interfaces. Our results encourage the use of a tongue-computer interface over other methods for physically disabled individuals. I...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{techniques}} and outcomes of percutaneous fixation, with the modified Essex-Lopresti technique, in isolated, displaced <b>tongue-type</b> calcaneal fractures. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 24 {{patients who received}} percutaneous calcaneal screw fixation in our hospital, from April 2003 to June 2009. One patient had bilateral fixation performed. All patients had a serial of X-rays of the injured foot, which included anteroposterior, axial, lateral, and Broden’s views. Preoperative and post-operative Bohler’s and Gissane’s angles were measured. The patients’ conditions were continuously assessed in serial follow-ups, and the Maryland Foot Score {{was used to evaluate}} the clinical outcome. Results: Bohler’s and Gissane’s angles were fully restored in 13 and 17 out of 25 fractures, respectively. The mean duration of post-operative hospital stay was 4 days. There were no major post-operative complications. Sixteen patients were able to resume their original jobs. The Maryland Foot Score rated 13 out of 25 injured limbs (52 %) as excellent, 9 (36 %) as good, and 3 (12 %) as fair. There were no patients rated as poor. The three patients with fair results complained of pain and stiffness at the subtalar joint. Conclusion: Percutaneous fixation of displaced <b>tongue-type</b> calcaneal fractures is an effective treatment with acceptable clinical outcome, short hospital stay, minimal skin complications, and quick recovery...|$|E
30|$|At this point, three bars were loosely {{connected}} to the tibial ring and footplate, with care being taken to position the bars in multiple planes to better resist shifting of the fracture once reduced. The width of the calcaneus was restored by manual pressure {{on either side of}} the calcaneus, while distal traction was applied by pulling the calcaneus distally and posteriorly. In order to aid reduction of the posterior facet, percutaneous manipulation with a Steinmann or Schanz pin in the tuberosity was used like a joystick in <b>tongue-type</b> fractures.|$|E
30|$|In <b>tongue-type</b> fractures, a Schanz pin can {{be placed}} lateral to the Achilles tendon and into the {{superior}} part of the large tuberosity fragment to manipulate its reduction and to disimpact the articular fragment. A sinus tarsi approach can then be performed to assess the articular surface reduction which is stabilised {{with a series of}} wires from anterior to posterior, followed by axial wires from posterolateral to anteromedial into the sustentaculum. Cannulated screws can then be passed over the AP wires to provide compression, followed by axial cannulated screws. The lateral articular fragment can then be elevated to restore the articular surface. A lag screw can then be inserted from the lateral cortex towards the sustentaculum tali capturing the “constant fragment”.|$|E
30|$|Patient-related factors, as {{distinct}} from the fracture characteristics, influence operative outcome significantly. Smoking, peripheral vascular disease and diabetes are associated with wound complications and infection. Worse outcomes are reported in men, those over 50 s and patients claiming workers’ compensation. There are some fractures for which surgery is the preferred option intuitively. Open fractures, grossly displaced fractures with severe impingement of soft tissues and those with impending skin breakdown (<b>tongue-type</b> fractures) are treated operatively. Direct evidence in support is absent, but this approach is {{made on the basis}} of the likely prognosis if left untreated; a RCT to provide an evidence-based decision may generate issues over equipoise in anticipated risks and benefits such as to be impracticable. Until then, it is likely surgeons will continue to treat these severe injuries operatively.|$|E
30|$|Hammesfahr and Fleming [11], {{as well as}} Paley and Hall [20], {{reported}} better {{outcomes in}} patients who had a tongue type fracture than in those who had a joint depression fracture. They added that moderate comminution of the joint depression fractures worsened the prognosis, and extensively comminuted fractures {{were associated with the}} worst prognosis. We were not able to find a significant relation between the type of fracture and the functional results because of a small number of cases in this sample. However, 83.3 % of patients with <b>tongue-type</b> fracture had satisfactory results, and 75 % of patients with joint depression type had satisfactory results. We found also the more comminuted the fracture, the more unsatisfactory the results. Two patients with poor results had type III fractures, while majority of patients (78.6 %) with satisfactory results had type II fractures.|$|E
30|$|The lateral {{wall of the}} calcaneus {{was then}} exposed by sharp {{dissection}} with a thin osteotome or periosteal elevator by first dissecting plantarward beneath the sheath of peroneal tendons, and then posteriorly where the distal end of calcaneofibular ligament and the lateral talocalcaneal ligament are identified and excised en-bloc. These ligaments are retracted along with the sheath of peroneal tendons which forms the posterior section of the capsule of the subtalar joint [23]. The lateral wall was sometimes surprisingly thin and comminuted. Therefore, {{it was possible to}} keep the lateral wall fragments together and attached to overlying tissue, and avoid separation by dissection, and retract it like a door to expose the depressed fracture fragment (Fig.  2 c). In cases of <b>tongue-type</b> fractures, it was possible to continue dissection bluntly by finger tip or blunt periosteal elevator along the superior aspect of the calcaneal tuberosity to expose the posterior portion of posterior facet. With the foot held in valgus and some degree of equinus, the lateral wall and the peroneal sheath are pulled with a small stout-toothed retractor. After sharp dissection of any remaining capsular tissue and washing out the fracture hematoma, it was possible to scout the displaced posterior articular facet. If inspection was difficult, an Inge retractor was placed into the depths of the sinus tarsi, pressing up on the neck of the talus and down on the sinus tarsi portion of the calcaneus to give a better view as far as the sustentaculum tali.|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{displaced}} intra-articular fractures of the os cal-cis {{are reviewed}} following open reduction and internal fixation using a lateral approach {{with an average}} follow-up of 22 months (range, 12 to 44 months). Postoperative management consisted of early subtalar motion with de-layed weightbearing. Twelve of 14 fractures were consid-ered good results {{on the basis of}} no pain, 50 % normal subtalar motion, and near-normal anatomy. Pain corre-lated with incomplete reduction of the superomedial frag-ment and, thus, incongruent reduction of the posterior facet in two cases. The importance of effecting a reduc-tion of the superomedial border of the os calcis is empha-sized. The incidence of fracture of the os calcis is approx-imately 1 to 2 %, 22, 23 with displaced fractures involving the subtalar joint accounting for approximately 60 to 75 % of these. 6, 12, 2 o Little disagreement surrounds the treatment of the remaining fractures with good results being obtained in the majority of cases. 4 - 6, 12, 20 It is with regard to the management of the displaced frac-ture involving the subtalar joint that the controversy exists. 1 - 6, 9 - 12, 14 - 16, 18 - 23 This article reviews a consecutive series of 14 dis-placed fractures of the as calcis involving the subtalar joint treated by open reduction and internal fixation using a lateral approach. In this series there were 11 joint depression fractures and three <b>tongue-type</b> frac-tures using the classification provided by Essex-Lo-presti " (Table 1). ANATOMY The as calcis is the largest of the tarsal bones and forms the posterior limb of the longitudinal arch. " The bone is composed of extremely vascular cancellous bone surrounded by a thin cortical shell and has a total of four articulating facets-three for the talus, the posterior, middle, and anterior facets, and one fo...|$|E
