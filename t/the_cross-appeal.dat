50|$|The bulk of {{the opinion}} {{was focused on the}} first of <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> issues.|$|E
50|$|The {{appeal was}} {{dismissed}} in a 6-0 ruling, while <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> was dismissed 5-1.|$|E
50|$|In a 6-3 decision, {{the appeal}} was allowed. The Court {{unanimously}} dismissed <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal.</b>|$|E
50|$|BCE and Bell Canada {{appealed the}} {{overturning}} {{of the trial}} judge’s approval of the plan of arrangement, and <b>the</b> debentureholders <b>cross‑appealed</b> <b>the</b> dismissal of the claims for oppression.|$|R
50|$|The {{appeal was}} allowed, and <b>the</b> University's <b>cross-appeal</b> was dismissed.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendant}} appealed and <b>the</b> plaintiff <b>cross-appealed</b> against <b>the</b> valuation {{placed on}} the property.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{unanimously}} {{allowed the}} Crown's appeal and dismissed <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal.</b> Justice Ellis concurred with Cooke P and Casey J.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{question}} of the amount of damages that was raised in <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal,</b> the Court agreed with the Court of Appeal that [...] "the claim being founded on breach of contract the damages cannot be increased by reason of the circumstances of dismissal whether in respect of the respondent's wounded feelings or the prejudicial effect upon his reputation and chances of finding other employment." [...] Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> was also dismissed.|$|E
50|$|Grant {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court. The court {{dismissed}} the appeal and <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal,</b> with only Justice Abella dissenting {{in part from the}} decision.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the judges}} of the court issued their own judgments. By a {{majority}} the Court dismissed <b>the</b> appeals. <b>The</b> <b>cross-appeals</b> were also allowed to an extent and the damages reduced to: Taunoa, $35,000; Robinson, $20,000; and Kidman $4,000. The Court also dismissed the applications for declarations that natural justice rights had been breached and for a direction to Corrections to hold an independent inquiry.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Attorney-General <b>cross-appealed</b> against <b>the</b> {{decision}} of the Court of Appeal seeking to lower or extinguish the awards of damages in respect of all prisoners except Tofts.|$|R
50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the SCC {{ruled that the}} appeals should be allowed and <b>the</b> <b>cross‑appeals</b> dismissed. In summary, it held that the s. 241 oppression action and the s. 192 requirement for court approval of a change to the corporate structure are different types of proceedings, engaging different inquiries. The Court of Appeal’s decision rested on an approach that erroneously combined {{the substance of the}} s. 241 oppression remedy with the onus of the s. 192 arrangement approval process, resulting in a conclusion that could not have been sustained under either provision, read on its own terms.|$|R
50|$|In a 6-1 ruling, {{the appeal}} was {{dismissed}} with costs. As it was therefore unnecessary to consider <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal,</b> it was dismissed without costs.|$|E
5000|$|The SCC {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} the appeal should be dismissed, and by 6-3 allowed <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal.</b> It accordingly issued the declaration sought in these terms: ...|$|E
5000|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{emphasized}} that he concurred {{in the judgment}} solely because he believed <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> rule to be a [...] "rule of practice" [...] for the courts of appeals rather than a jurisdictional limitation.|$|E
50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision by Rothstein J., <b>the</b> appeal and <b>cross-appeal</b> were dismissed.|$|R
50|$|Lamparello {{appealed the}} District Court's order and Falwell <b>cross-appealed</b> <b>the</b> denial of {{statutory}} damages and attorney fees.|$|R
5000|$|Leave {{to appeal}} and <b>cross-appeal</b> <b>the</b> {{decision}} were {{granted by the}} Supreme Court of Canada in November 2011: ...|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{nothing in}} the text of [...] {{overrides}} <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> rule. Indeed, § 3742 was enacted in 1984 with full knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> rule, which had been a firmly entrenched rule of appellate procedure. Reading § 3742 to allow appellate courts to sua sponte increase criminal sentences without an appeal from the government would [...] "give with one hand what it takes away with the other." [...] Executive-branch officials would be vested with the discretion to seek an increased sentence, but their decision not to do so could be overridden by judicial officers; Congress, in enacting § 3742, would not have intended such an inconsistent result.|$|E
50|$|The {{appeal was}} allowed in part, and <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> was dismissed. The damages for conduct in {{dismissal}} and punitive damages awards were set aside. At other levels, costs {{should be at}} a partial indemnity scale and the cost premium set aside.|$|E
5000|$|In dismissing <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal,</b> Moldaver J {{held that}} even the {{perfunctory}} consultation contemplated by the Court of Appeal was liable to cause an [...] "appearances problem," [...] while LeBel and Cromwell JJ felt that the Court of Appeal was essentially correct in determining how and when the right to consult with counsel should not be exercised.|$|E
50|$|London Drugs appealed this {{decision}} and <b>the</b> respondent employees <b>cross‑appealed,</b> arguing {{that they should}} be completely free of liability.|$|R
5000|$|On <b>cross-appeal,</b> <b>the</b> Board {{questioned}} whether the Court of Appeal was correct in law in dismissing its argument relating to causation.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendants}} appealed {{against the}} injunction, and <b>the</b> plaintiffs <b>cross-appealed</b> {{for an increase}} in the award of damages. Michael Kempster QC and James N. Harper appeared as counsel for the club; James Chadwin QC and Frederick Such as counsel for the Millers at a two-day hearing on 31 March and 1 April 1977.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Samuel Alito {{started with}} the premise that <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> rule was merely a [...] "rule of appellate practice" [...] that [...] "rests on {{premises}} about the efficient use of judicial resources and {{the proper role of}} the tribunal in an adversary system." [...] Because those rules are judge-made rules, they can be altered by judges sua sponte.|$|E
50|$|These {{appeals and}} <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> {{are not about}} whether {{prostitution}} should be legal or not. They are about whether the laws Parliament has enacted on how prostitution may be carried out pass constitutional muster. I conclude that they do not. I would therefore make a suspended declaration of invalidity, returning {{the question of how}} to deal with prostitution to Parliament.|$|E
50|$|The {{appeal was}} dismissed, and <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> was allowed. In his opinion, Lord Porter held {{that this case}} fell within the same scope {{as that of the}} Radio Reference in {{determining}} the nature of works and undertakings and under which jurisdiction they fall. As Winner was carrying on an undertaking connecting New Brunswick with both Nova Scotia and Maine, there exists an undertaking connecting province with province and beyond the limits of the province. Therefore, it was an undertaking that fell within federal jurisdiction, and it was one and indivisible.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} Daishowa's appeal, allowed <b>the</b> Minister's <b>cross-appeal</b> and {{set aside}} the Judge’s decision. In his ruling, Nadon JA (as he then was) agreed with Miller J as to the whether assumption of liabilities formed part of consideration, but held {{that there was no}} basis for reducing the value in question: ...|$|R
2500|$|As of February 28, 2008, Padilla had appealed his {{conviction}} and sentence, and <b>the</b> government had <b>cross-appealed.</b> <b>The</b> Wall Street Journal {{said in an}} editorial, [...] "the lawyers suing for Padilla aren't interested in justice. They're practicing 'lawfare,' which {{is an effort to}} undermine the war on terror by making U.S. officials afraid to pursue it for fear of personal liability." [...] In January 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and his case has been ruled on numerous times.|$|R
50|$|The court {{unanimously}} dismissed <b>the</b> {{appeal and}} <b>cross-appeal</b> on <b>the</b> {{basis of a}} s 7 argument, although it found no division of powers flaw in the CDSA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{appellant}} {{appealed to}} the Appellate Division, in Langley Fox Building Partnership v De Valence, against the finding that it was liable to compensate the respondent for any loss sustained by her. In turn, the respondent cross-appealed, claiming {{that she should have}} been awarded damages in the amount of R593 070. Goldstone AJA found on the appeal, [...] "in all the circumstances," [...] that [...] "the learned trial Judge correctly held the appellant liable to compensate the respondent for the damages sustained by her." [...] <b>The</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> was also upheld.|$|E
5000|$|The Eighth Circuit, nevertheless, {{predicated}} increasing Greenlaw's sentence by 15 {{years on}} its {{reading of the}} plain-error rule of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). [...] "A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered appeal {{even though it was}} not brought to the lower court's attention." [...] When Congress enacted the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, there was no intent to supplant <b>the</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> requirement. Ordinarily, the plain-error rule inures to the benefit of defendants; appellate courts will correct so-called [...] "plain" [...] errors only when ignoring them would work {{to the detriment of the}} defendant (who usually has a different lawyer on appeal). In the absence of a cross-appeal, the plain-error rule does not allow appellate judges to interfere with the assessment of high-level executive-branch officials who may have decided that appealing a sentence in a particular criminal case was not a wise expenditure of resources.|$|E
5000|$|Great Lakes appealed both {{decisions}} to the Federal Court of Appeal, and North Central also <b>cross‑appealed</b> <b>the</b> trial judge's finding of fault against the Widener. In its ruling, the FCA: ...|$|R
50|$|Both sides <b>cross-appealed.</b> <b>The</b> case {{worked its}} way through the appellate process, {{culminating}} in the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|On January 26, 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal {{heard the}} appeals, and {{dismissed}} <b>the</b> appeal and <b>cross-appeal</b> without costs. COMER was given 60 days to file an amended statement of claim.|$|R
50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, <b>the</b> appeal and <b>cross-appeal</b> were dismissed. Neuberger MR {{held that the}} old Court of Appeal authority was binding, and TPL only had a personal claim in equity over the assets.|$|R
