5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language</b> (te reo Māori) {{in schools and}} workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori. Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{its value}} to Albanian Christians, who could {{for the first time}} read the Gospels in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language,</b> Meksi's work {{advanced}} the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, August Schleicher, and Johann Georg von Hahn. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the union, the process of gradual Polonization gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use. However, the local Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language</b> and remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox church.|$|E

5|$|The Amorites in Qatna spoke <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language,</b> but kings {{communicated with}} their {{counterparts}} using Akkadian, {{which was the}} language of writing in the city. Qatna's Akkadian became heavily influenced by Hurrian in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special AkkadianHurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna. Texts from Qatna exhibit many Hurrian elements, proving that Hurrian was prominent among scribes, but its predominance as a spoken language {{by the general public}} cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|When the Persian fleet {{arrived in}} Asia Minor, Datis and Artaphernes took the Eretrians before Darius in Susa. The Eretrians were not harmed by Darius {{who decided to}} settle them {{in the town of}} Ardericca in Cissia. They were still there, using <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language</b> and customs, when Herodotus wrote his history, and were {{encountered}} by Alexander the Great during his conquest of Persia a further century later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of indigenous literacy in Ottawa {{arose in the}} 19th century, as speakers of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language.</b> Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography, while Methodist and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies. Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals. Ottawa speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to Anishinabe Enamiad ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan missionaries and published in Harbor Springs, Michigan between 1896 and 1902.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Malaysian Census {{reported}} {{the population of}} Sabah at 3,543,500, being the third most populous state in Malaysia and have the highest non-citizens population at 870,400. However, as Malaysia {{is one of the}} least densely populated countries in Asia, Sabah is particularly sparsely populated with most of the population concentrated in the coastal areas since towns and urban centres have massively expanded. People from Sabah are generally called Sabahans and identify themselves as such. There is an estimate of 42 ethnic groups with over 200 sub-ethnic groups with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language,</b> culture and beliefs which predicted to be increase more in the future due to high interracial marriage and recent migration.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. Māori were discouraged from speaking <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language</b> in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Māori. The future of the language {{was the subject of a}} claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Māori was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of Māori people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in the language. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori. Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years.|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language</b> policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>language.</b> A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
