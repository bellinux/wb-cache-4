5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and <b>titanium</b> <b>trichloride</b> (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.|$|E

Indanones 5 and 11 were readily converted into their corresponding indene derivatives tetrahydro- 2 -methylbenz[e]indene (6) and tetrahydro- 2 -methylbenz[f]indene (12), respectively. Two new half sandwich <b>titanium</b> <b>trichlorides</b> based on 6 and 12 were synthesized and were shown to polymerize styrene to s-PS with activities in the low 107 range. ^ Two efficient synthetic routes to the novel titanatrane complexes, indenyl titanatrane (19) and 2 -methylbenz[e]indenyl titanatrane (20) have been presented. These new titanatranes along with the known titanatranes, Cp titanatrane (17) and Cp* titanatrane (18) were tested as potential catalyst precursors for the polymerization of styrene and ethylene. Complex 17 was a very efficient catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene at 0 °C, exhibiting a 100 fold increase over its corresponding trichloride derivative (CpTiCl 3) Complex 18 proved to be the most versatile catalyst producing very high activities in the polymerization of styrene and moderate activities in the polymerization of ethylene. ^ A new versatile synthetic route to substituted alkyl bridged bis-indanones and bis-indenes was developed. In addition, these bis-indenes can be employed as useful ligands in the synthesis of ansa-titanocenes. Ansa-titanocene complexes 22 and 63 were active in catalyzing the polymerization of olefins when activated by MAO, exhibiting activities of ca. 1 × 107 for the polymerization of ethylene and ca. 1. 5 × 104 in catalyzing the polymerization of propylene. ^ Four new C 1 symmetric metallocenes containing a substituted indenyl moiety were synthesized. Metallocenes 68 – 70 and 72 were active for both the polymerization of ethylene and propylene when activated with MAO. In general, diphenylsilylene-bridged catalysts produce polymers of higher molecular weights than do dimethylsilylene-bridged catalysts. Overall, one obtains a higher activity but polymers of lower molecular weights with ethylene-bridged catalysts versus silylene-bridged catalysts. ^ In addition, four new C 1 symmetric metallocenes containing 2, 7 -disubstituted fluorenyl moieties were synthesized. Three of the four metallocenes, 86 – 88, were highly active for the polymerization of both ethylene and propylene. In general, the most sterically hindered catalysts were more active and produced polymers of higher molecular weights than do their less hindered counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} {{as part of}} a broader effort to automate analytical methods for determining plutonium and other radioisotopes in environmental samples. The work described here represented a screening study to evaluate the effect of applying ultrasonic irradiation to dissolve high-fired plutonium oxide. The major findings of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) High-fired plutonium oxide does not undergo measurable dissolution when sonicated in nitric acid solutions, even at a high concentration range of nitric acid where the calculated thermodynamic solubility of plutonium oxide exceeds the ?g/mL level. (2) Applying organic complexants (nitrilotriacetic acid) and reductants (hydroxyurea) in 1. 5 M nitric acid does not significantly increase the dissolution compared with digestion in nitric acid alone. Nearly all (99. 5 %) of the plutonium oxide remains undissolved under these conditions. (3) The action of a strong inorganic reductant, <b>titanium</b> <b>trichloride</b> in 25 wt% HCl, results in 40 % dissolution of the plutonium oxide when the <b>titanium</b> <b>trichloride</b> concentration is ? 1 wt% under sonication. (4) Oxidative treatment of plutonium oxide by freshly dissolved AgO ({approx} 20 mg/mL) in 1. 5 M nitric acid with sonication resulted in 95 % plutonium oxide dissolution. However, the same treatment of plutonium oxide mechanically mixed with 50 mg of Columbia River sediment (CRS) results in a significant decrease of dissolution yield of plutonium oxide (< 20 % dissolved at the same AgO loading) because of parasitic consumption of AG(II) by oxidizable components of the CRS. (5) Digesting plutonium oxide in HF resulted in dissolution yields slightly higher than 80 % for HF concentration from 6 M to 14 M. Sonication did not result in any improvement in dissolution efficiency in HF. (6) Mixed nitric acid/HF solutions result in a higher dissolution yield of plutonium oxide compared with digestion in HF alone (at the same HF concentrations). Practically quantitative dissolution of PuO 2 can be achieved with 6 to 8 M nitric acid + 14 M HF or 8 M nitric acid + 4 M HF mixtures. In the latter case, quantitative dissolution of plutonium oxide was demonstrated only with sonication. Overall, the results indicate that applying ultrasound in an isolated cup horn configuration to dissolve refractory plutonium oxide does not offer any substantial advantage over conventional ?heat and mix? treatment. Oxidative treatment by AgO appears to be effective only when very little or no oxidizable materials are present in the digested sample. The catalytic use of Ag(II) in the ''Catalyzed Electrolytic Plutonium Oxide Dissolution'' technology would probably be more effective than using AgO because the Ag(II) is continually regenerated electrochemically. Reductive treatment with <b>titanium</b> <b>trichloride</b> in HCl solution proves to be less efficient than the previously observed effect based on in situ generation of Ti(III) in phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid media using a dip probe sonication setup.
