Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company's {{operations}} along the coast {{can be seen by}} their 1870 schedule, in which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> the journey to Kiama, Shoalhaven and Gerringong every three days, and to Ulladulla, Clyde, Shoalhaven and Wollongong at about the same rate. Mourya was visited every two weeks, while an additional journey was made to Merimbula and Ulladulla once a week. 1873 saw a simplification of these services, and a weekly run to Merimbula, Eden and Tathra was amongst the changes.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley {{was signed}} by Conference Premier club York City on 19 June 2007, to provide {{competition}} for Richard Brodie, Craig Farrell and Onome Sodje. He made his debut as a starter in their 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge on 11 August 2007, {{in which he was}} substituted on 62 minutes. Despite struggling for a place in the team, Beardsley turned down a loan move to Conference North club Tamworth in September 2007, in order to prove his worth at York. He suffered a broken jaw in two places during York's 2–0 away win over Grays Athletic on 22 September 2007, after being elbowed by Jamie Stuart in an off-the-ball incident, which was likely to rule Beardsley out for at least three months. Essex Police confirmed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> enquiries following the incident. Beardsley returned to the team as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 1–1 home draw with Crawley Town on 1 December 2007. He finished his York career with nine appearances.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making.</b> Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E

5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 October 1978, {{about a week after}} the {{extermination}} threat, George Burkitt and his 20-year-old son Philip were working on Philip's Triumph Spitfire car in front of their house. At around 7pm, annoyed by the noise <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making,</b> Williams shot them both with a 9mm, Smith & Wesson automatic pistol. George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making,</b> the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the idea}} of shadows, a major theme that {{received}} considerable notice by the academic public was the literal liberation of the young female voice during the Hasenjagd and, consequently, during the war. Reichart allowed the reader to see {{into the mind of}} a tormented, silenced girl, thus freeing her voice. Through Reichart's book, the Austrian readers could feel <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> a positive and progressive movement in history by becoming aware of the tragedy of the war, and accepting their place and major faults in it.|$|E
