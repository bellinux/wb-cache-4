5|$|In 1894, Lemoine co-founded another {{mathematical}} journal entitled, L'intermédiaire des mathématiciens {{along with}} Charles Laisant, a friend {{whom he met}} at the École Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought {{that he would be}} too busy to create it. At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea of the journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. <b>The</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject. Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF {{have been}} the subject of several films. Some {{examples}} are Swedish football documentaries Blådårar1 and Blådårar2, which portray the club from both supporter and player perspectives during the 1997 and 2000 seasons. Blådårar1 is set in 1997, when the club finished third in Allsvenskan. The film focuses on devoted fan Lasse, player Anders Andersson, former chairman Hans Cavalli-Björkman and other individuals. Blådårar2 is set in 2000, <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> club had been relegated to Superettan, and follows the team as they fight for Malmö FF's return to Allsvenskan. The second film continues to follow Lasse, but also has a significant focus on Zlatan Ibrahimović, his progress and how he was eventually sold to AFC Ajax during the 2001 season.|$|E

5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. <b>The</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E

In Berlin he also met and befriended many other artists, most notably Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, and Theo van Doesburg. Together with Schwitters and van Doesburg, Lissitzky presented the idea of an international artistic movement under the guidelines of constructivism while also working with Kurt Schwitters on the issue Nasci (Nature) of the periodical Merz, and continuing to illustrate children's books. <b>The</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> publication of his first Proun series in Moscow in 1921, Schwitters introduced Lissitzky to the Hanover gallery kestnergesellschaft, where he held his first solo exhibition. The second Proun series, printed in Hanover in 1923, was a success, utilizing new printing techniques. Later on, he met Sophie Kuppers, who was the widow of Paul Kuppers, an art director of the kestnergesellschaft at which Lissitzky was showing, and whom he would marry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|From early 1932 {{to early}} 1934, Arkansas {{returned}} for another {{stint in the}} Pacific Fleet, followed by another tour of Europe later in <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she {{was assigned to the}} reserve force for the Neutrality Patrols. She supported the occupation of Iceland in July 1941 as an escort for the troopship convoys. In November, as it became increasingly apparent that the United States would become involved in World War II, Wyoming was reassigned as a gunnery training ship, a role she served in {{for the duration of the}} war. Arkansas, meanwhile, continued in front-line service during the war, first as an escort to convoys to North Africa, and then as a shore bombardment vessel. She supported the landings at Normandy in June 1944, shelling German positions at Omaha Beach, before bombarding Cherbourg later in the month. Her next bombardment mission came with Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, in August that year. She was then transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations for action against the Japanese. She bombarded Japanese positions on Iwo Jima in February 1945 and on Okinawa in April.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} Pallas in 1802, <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{discovery of}} Ceres. He {{proposed that the}} two objects were {{the remnants of a}} destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.|$|E
