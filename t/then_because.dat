5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by <b>then</b> <b>because</b> of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{has always}} participated by itself {{in most of}} the major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. At the Olympic Games the International Olympic Committee charter only permit a Great Britain Olympic {{football}} team, representing the whole of the United Kingdom, to compete. Teams of amateur players represented Great Britain at the Olympics from 1900 until 1972, but the FA stopped entering a team after <b>then</b> <b>because</b> the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished. The successful bid by London for the 2012 Summer Olympics prompted the FA to explore how a team could be entered. The SFA responded by stating that it would not participate, as it feared that this would threaten the independent status of the Scotland national team. FIFA President Sepp Blatter denied this, but the SFA expressed concern that a future President could take a different view. An agreement was reached in May 2009 whereby the FA would be permitted to organise a team using only England-qualified players, but this was successfully challenged by the British Olympic Association. Only English and Welsh players were selected for the men's squad, but two Scottish players were selected for the women's team.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1918, {{the leader}} of the local secret police, Gavril Myasnikov, with the {{connivance}} of other local Bolsheviks, hatched a plan to murder Michael. Myasnikov assembled a team of four men who, like him, were all former prisoners of the Tsarist regime: Vasily Ivanchenko, Ivan Kolpashchikov, Andrei Markov and Nikolai Zhuzhgov. Using a forged order, the four men gained entry to Michael's hotel at 11.45 p.m. At first, Michael refused to accompany the men until he spoke with the local chairman of the secret police, Pavel Malkov, and <b>then</b> <b>because</b> he was ill. His protestations were futile and he got dressed. Johnson insisted on accompanying him and the four men plus their two prisoners climbed into two horse-drawn three-seater traps. They drove out of the town into the forest near Motovilikha. When Michael queried their destination, he was told they were going to a remote railway crossing to catch a train. By now it was the early hours of 13 June. They all alighted from the carriages {{in the middle of the}} wood, and both Michael and Johnson were fired upon, once each, but as the assassins were using home-made bullets, their guns jammed. Michael, whether wounded or not is unknown, moved towards the wounded Johnson with arms outstretched, when he was shot at point-blank range in the head. Both Zhuzhgov and Markov claimed to have fired the fatal shot. Johnson was shot dead by Ivanchenko. The bodies were stripped and buried. Anything of value was stolen and the clothes were taken back to Perm. After they were shown to Myasnikov as proof of the murders, the clothes were burned. The Ural Regional Soviet, headed by Alexander Beloborodov, approved the execution, either retrospectively or beforehand, as did Lenin. Michael was the first of the Romanovs to be executed by the Bolsheviks but he was not the last. Neither Michael's nor Johnson's remains have been found.|$|E

25|$|In the 6th century BCE, the {{knowledge}} of circulation of vital fluids through the body was known to the Ayurvedic physician Sushruta in ancient India. He also seems to have possessed knowledge of the arteries, described as 'channels' by Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007). The valves of the heart were discovered by a physician of the Hippocratean school around the 4th century BCE. However their function was not properly understood <b>then.</b> <b>Because</b> blood pools in the veins after death, arteries look empty. Ancient anatomists assumed they were filled with air {{and that they were}} for transport of air.|$|E
25|$|Disks around {{brown dwarfs}} {{have been found}} to have many of the same {{features}} as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs. Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants. If a giant planet orbits a brown dwarf across our line of sight, <b>then,</b> <b>because</b> they have approximately the same diameter, this would give a large signal for detection by transit. The accretion zone for planets around a brown dwarf is very close to the brown dwarf itself, so tidal forces would have a strong effect.|$|E

25|$|In QM, {{predictions}} are {{formulated in}} terms of probabilities — for example, the probability that an electron will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a definite position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a hidden variables theory, {{might be able to}} predict those quantities exactly, {{while at the same time}} also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, <b>then</b> <b>because</b> the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.|$|E
25|$|Leonida {{began work}} in late February 1944, {{and the first}} batch of twenty {{conversions}} was complete {{by the end of}} June. Production was halted <b>then</b> <b>because</b> the gun was thought inadequate to face the new heavily armored IS-2 tanks being fielded by the Soviets. Ten vehicles were organized into the 63rd TACAM Company in July 1944 and assigned to the 1st Armored Training Division. They didn't see combat until after Romania's defection to the Allies. A company of twelve was assigned to the Niculescu Detachment when it was rushed north at the beginning of September to defend the Transylvanian frontier against the Axis counterattack from Hungary. Four more were added when the Niculescu Detachment was absorbed into the ad hoc Armored Group on 29 September in preparation for attacks intended to clear Northern Transylvania. This was successful and the Armored Group was disbanded when the last Axis units were forced from Romanian territory on 25 October 1944.|$|E
25|$|Islam {{integrated}} {{the concept}} of Jinn from pre-Islamic animism, but reduced {{the status of the}} former divine Jinn to mortals and created entities, who share the earth along with humans and will be judged on judgement Day by the only one God. Accordingly, the society of Jinn resembles that of humans, and are believed to procreate, eat, sleep, die and practise religion. Due to their similarities with humans, several narrations hold, that humans and Jinn may have sexual interactions and some legal book even deal with conditions of a marriage between these different beings. Nevertheless, Islam forbids interaction with Jinn. The Jinn may also cause possession and harm humans, but Jinn attacks are considered as an result of their own intention instead of evil nature, although an individual Jinni maybe evil, but <b>then</b> <b>because</b> of its own decision. The Jinn live either in an intermediary realm, between the divine world and the physical plane, like the Greek Daemon and ancient Rome Genii or roaming earth invisible to humans eye.|$|E
