40|$|Abstract. Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behavior of <b>the</b> nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area in <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar, <b>the</b> change in <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume and <b>the</b> maximum <b>wear</b> depth with <b>the</b> slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> tests showed that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume and <b>the</b> maximum <b>wear</b> depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar, it is possible to separate the size of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar from <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area and <b>the</b> transferred one. In addition, we found that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume has a linear relation with <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area rather than the size of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behavior at each spring shape...|$|R
40|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> {{quantification}} techniques {{applied to}} point contacts, the most typical one consists of measuring the longitudinal and transversal wear scar diameters of <b>the</b> <b>worn</b> surface. However, this method {{does not provide}} information about the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> along <b>the</b> <b>worn</b> surfaces. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> prediction using wear scar diameters could be misrepresentative because of the irregular shape of <b>the</b> <b>worn</b> surfaces. This drawback should be considered especially when {{the scope of the}} test method is the determination of <b>the</b> relative <b>wear</b> preventive properties of lubricants in sliding contacts. This paper compares two hydraulic lubricants from different manufacturers using a four-ball tribometer under the ASTM D 4172 standard. Wear was measured by <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar diameter and wear volume with an optical 3 D profilometer. Experimental results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume measurement is a more sensitive method than <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar diameter one. Even more, the use of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar diameter could lead to contradictions when performing a comparison of very similar results.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>wear</b> {{process in}} three-body contact causes {{problems}} of abrasion such as volume loss and changes of geometry of <b>the</b> triboelements. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> problem leads to increased failure and high costs for repairing or replacing equipment. To {{understand the nature}} of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour and to predict <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> rate in advance, experimental investigation and numerical simulation of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> process are required. In this work, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> process is analysed and the influencing parameters governing <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour are investigated experimentally to develop a new wear model. Main influential factors are considered such as kinematics of abrasive particles, contact stiffness of the particle layer, friction characteristics, and <b>wear</b> factors. <b>The</b> experiments to study kinematics of particle layers are performed on a new observation tester. To define the contact stiffness of abrasive particles, experiments are conducted by the uniaxial spindle compression tester. Moreover, a tribometer test rig with applied load up to 200 N and velocity up to 1000 mm/s is used to investigate the friction characteristics and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour of three-body tribosystem. Analyses of influential factors on <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour in dependency of predefined process parameter are carried out. Additionally, {{based on the results of}} the experimental investigations, approximation equations representing the relation of the influential factors and the process parameters are determined. A three-body wear model is build up to represent <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour by physical wear laws. Furthermore, these approximation equations and the relevant parameters obtained by experimental investigations are included in <b>the</b> Fleischer’s <b>wear</b> equation to simulate <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> process. With <b>the</b> coupled model <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> process of <b>the</b> sample can be simulated twodimensional over the sliding distance. It is possible to predict <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> depth and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> intensity, which can be used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> rate. Additionally, from the results of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> simulation <b>the</b> <b>worn</b> surface and <b>the</b> local contact pressure in the contact region are determined which provide a deeper insight into <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> process. With this simulation the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviour can be improved which is important to solve wear problems...|$|R

Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce <b>the</b> <b>wearing</b> of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E

40|$|Wear {{modeling}} {{is essential}} to predict and improve wear re-sistance of machine parts. This article presents a fatigue wear model of plane sliding pairs under dry friction. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> model is constructed through developing a dynamic contact model of surfaces and proposing a mean fatigue damage constant of asperities. It is simpler and more practical than existing fa-tigue wear models because it describes the quantitative relation-ship between <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviors of <b>the</b> plane sliding pairs and the main factors including the load and sliding speed, mate-rial property, friction property, and surface topography of the pairs. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> model can predict <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> of each component of the sliding pairs.
