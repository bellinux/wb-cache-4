5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire. Wolfe had devised a firing method for {{stopping}} French column advances in 1755 {{that called for}} the centre—in this case, the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments—to hold fire {{while waiting for the}} advancing force to approach within , <b>then</b> <b>open</b> fire at close range.|$|E

5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, <b>then</b> <b>open</b> and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007 the Extraordinary Ordsall Campaign {{applied for}} a grant of £5.1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), to {{regenerate}} Ordsall Hall and secure its future. After supporters had raised £1 million by September 2008, the HLF provided the remaining £4.1 million. Only 40 per cent of the building was <b>then</b> <b>open</b> to the public, but following restoration work further rooms {{were expected to be}} opened. The building closed for refurbishment in early 2009, and re-opened to the public on 15 May 2011. In 2013 the newly restored building received a Bronze Award in the Small Visitor Attraction category organised by tourist body VisitEngland, one of 320 nominations from across the country.|$|E
5|$|The two {{contestant}}s <b>then</b> <b>open</b> their largest {{pieces of}} baggage and reveal the secrets they contain. Each contestant makes one final statement, {{and the main}} contestant eliminates a second contestant. The main contestant's own baggage is then opened and the contents revealed to the remaining contestant. If the contestant accepts the secret belonging to the central character, the couple is given an expense-covered evening together. However, if the contestant can not accept the secret, the pair part ways.|$|E
5|$|Victory at Thermopylae {{meant that}} all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; Attica was <b>then</b> <b>open</b> to invasion. The {{remaining}} population of Athens was evacuated, {{with the aid}} of the Allied fleet, to Salamis. The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from Megara, abandoning Athens to the Persians. Athens thus fell to the Persians; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be razed.|$|E

5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, <b>then</b> <b>open</b> the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is <b>then</b> <b>open</b> to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
5|$|From September 1513 to 1516, under Pope Leo X, Leonardo {{spent much}} of his time living in the Belvedere in the Vatican in Rome, where Raphael and Michelangelo were both active at the time. In October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan. On 19 December, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna. Leonardo was {{commissioned}} to make for Francis a mechanical lion that could walk forward <b>then</b> <b>open</b> its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies. In 1516, he entered Francis' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé, now a public museum, near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise. He spent the last three years of his life here, accompanied by his friend and apprentice, Count Francesco Melzi, and supported by a pension totalling 10,000scudi.|$|E

25|$|On 31 March 1976 {{the biggest}} train robbery in Irish history {{took place at}} Wheatfield. Eight men in {{fluorescent}} jackets used emergency signals to stop the mail train bound from Cork to Dublin and escaped with £600,000 in small denomination notes. The incident became the centre of a celebrated miscarriage of justice case, known mistakenly as the Sallins Train Robbery case after the nearest rail station <b>then</b> <b>open,</b> when three men were wrongly convicted of the robbery.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} and library were arranged in galleries within {{the university and}} a guidebook published in 1915. Initially, the collection's visitors were students and academics; it was not <b>then</b> <b>open</b> to the general public. Petrie retired from University College London (UCL) in 1933, though his successors continued {{to add to the}} collections, excavating in other parts of Egypt and the Sudan. During the Second World War (1939–1945) the collection was packed up and moved out of London for safekeeping. In the early 1950s it was moved into a former stable, where it remains adjacent to the science library of UCL.|$|E
25|$|In May 1944, the Soviet army {{began its}} {{offensive}} to retake Sevastopol. The 89th Division {{was given the}} objective of capturing the Gornaya Height, which would <b>then</b> <b>open</b> the way to Sevastopol. This was accomplished and the unit subsequently took part in Sevastopol's and the promontory of Kherson's recapture. For the liberation of the Sevastopol the division was bestowed with the Order of the Red Banner. Senior Lieutenants Simeon K. Baghdasaryan and Khoren A. Khachaturyan, and Senior Sergeants Aydin Gh. Harutyunyan, Harutyun R. Mkrtchyan and Vardges A. Rostomyan were awarded with the Order of the Hero of Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Kennedy-Warren {{when it opened in}} 1931 was its air-cooling system. Three {{enormous}} fans drew cool air from Klingle Park {{at the back of the}} building and forced it through the public corridors. Residents could <b>then</b> <b>open</b> metal louvers above their hallway doors to cool individual apartments. Cross-ventilation during temperate weather was so effective that doorstops were required to prevent doors from slamming closed if left ajar. Advertisements for the Kennedy-Warren showed that the air was at least ten degrees cooler than on Connecticut Avenue. The fans were removed during the 2009–11 renovation after central air conditioning was installed.|$|E
25|$|As per tradition, the Sikhs {{gathered}} in the Golden Temple to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi in 1919. After their visit, many {{walked over to the}} Jallianwala Bagh next to it to listen to speakers protesting Rowlatt Act and other policies of the colonial British government. A large crowd had gathered, when the British general Reginald Dyer ordered his soldiers to surround the Jallianwala Bagh, <b>then</b> <b>open</b> fire into the civilian crowd. Hundreds died and thousands were wounded. The massacre strengthened the opposition to the colonial rule throughout India, and particularly Sikhs. It triggered massive non-violent protests. The protests pressured the British government to transfer the control over the management and treasury of the Golden Temple to an elected organization called Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC). The SGPC continues to manage the Golden Temple.|$|E
25|$|He {{was awarded}} the highest honours <b>then</b> <b>open</b> to British men of science. The Royal Society, who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award. He was the {{youngest}} biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life came the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894; the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876; the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards {{are listed in the}} Life and Letters. He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of University College, Oxford.|$|E
