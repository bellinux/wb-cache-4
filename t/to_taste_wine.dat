2500|$|It {{was taught}} in a Baraita that Rabbi taught that {{the laws of the}} nazirite in [...] follow {{immediately}} those of the woman accused of being unfaithful in [...] to teach that anyone who sees an unfaithful wife in her ruination should (take a lesson from her ways and) completely abstain from wine (for wine brought her to her end). Similarly, a Midrash taught that when they made the suspected wife drink, they told her that much might have been due to wine. And all the Israelites who had seen it would come home and bemoan the person who had drunk wine, got intoxicated, committed sin, and died. And so they would swear never <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>wine,</b> so that they might not meet the same fate. And the Midrash provided another explanation: Just as the nazirite was separated from wine, so God separated the faithless wife from other women. Similarly, another Midrash taught that wine leads to whoredom. And thus God wrote the section about the nazirite after the section about the suspected wife to indicate that one should not copy the deeds of the adulterer and adulteress who drank wine and disgraced themselves, but that one who is afraid of sin should separate from wine.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{wine tasting}} {{descriptors}} allows the taster to qualitatively relate the aromas and flavors that the taster experiences {{and can be}} used in assessing the overall quality of wine. Wine writers, like Karen MacNeil, author of The Wine Bible, differentiate wine tasters from casual enthusiasts; tasters attempt to give an objective description of the wine's taste (often taking a systematic approach to tasting), casual enthusiasts appreciate wine but pause their examination sooner than tasters. The primary source of a person's ability <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>wine</b> is derived from his or her olfactory senses. A taster's own personal experiences {{play a significant role in}} conceptualizing what he or she is tasting and attaching a description to that perception. The individual nature of tasting means that descriptors may be perceived differently among various tasters.|$|E

[...] As early as the Classical era, {{commentators}} on [...] have excused Noah's excessive drinking because he {{was considered to be}} the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the soothing, consoling, and enlivening effects of wine. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and a Church Father, wrote in the 4th Century that Noah's behaviour is defensible: as the first human <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>wine,</b> he would not know its effects: [...] "Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor".|$|E
5000|$|Hooke prefers blind tastings and is {{independent}} from any retail interests. Huon does not hire other people <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>wine</b> on his behalf. On his website Hooke describes his approach as follows:::"Almost all the wines I review are first tasted ‘blind’. I {{believe it is}} important for that first impression to be uncoloured by any preconception that may come from viewing the label. Having blind-tasted, though, I don’t consider the result to be holy writ: after unmasking I always check, and if necessary re-taste. No-one’s palate is perfect and there are always wines that will “fall through the cracks”, ending up with rougher treatment than they deserve. In blind tasting, it is easy for a minor blemish to have a disproportionate influence on the assessment. We have to be mindful that wine is a drink, and often, wines with a small imperfection are often great to drink. A slight whiff of reduction in a young riesling may be a defect to a clinical blind-taster in his ivory tower, but in the final summation, it is barely worth commenting on - and usually dissipates after a little exposure to the air anyway." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{structure}} of wine consumption in the Japanese market, focusing on the consumption in households. Considering various tendencies of Japanese eating and drinking habits nowadays related to wine consumption, the model was built and empirically estimated. The data to be investigated was household's data from the past twenty-seven years of official statistics. It was found that Japanese households show high income elasticity for wine demand. The strategy to prioritize department store distribution was demonstrated to be effective due to the fact that wine consumption in the high income class is steadily high, while the sensitivity to income and compatibility of foods is higher in middle income classes. However, the result that compatibility of foods with wine is influential suggests the necessity to revise the strategy. The facts that Japanese in general accept <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>wine</b> although there are some cultural barriers such as incompatibility of foods with wine should be considered in the strategy. wine consumption, compatibility of foods with wine, price elasticity, income elasticity, influence of recession, International Relations/Trade, Q 110, Q 130,...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, due to changes of consumers’ eating habits “quality wine” (“DOCG” – Designation of Origin Guaranteed, “DOC” – Designation of Origin, “IGT” – Typical Geographic Indication) demand has {{significantly}} changed. Wine, no longer considered only as an alcoholic drink, it now represents {{something that needs to}} satisfy the consumer’s desire of wellness and wellbeing. The evolution of wine sector, primarily related to consumer’s changes in eating habits and lifestyles, has also impacted some area of the supply chain as product distribution and sales. This growing business, characterized by having different types of distribution channels that cover demand of wine at different consumer level, requires the support of marketing teams able to communicate an international media message effective across cultures. Quality wine has now entered the area of social relationships where the emotional feeling is linked to the “the quality of drinking”. On other hands, it is also important that wine’s producers get complete information on the advantages and the critical issues/constraints of each different distribution channel, in order to easily meet consumers. Wine shops, extremely important distribution channel in the wine marketplace, have been always considered by experts the best sale channel and today they represent also as a trendy place where consumers can buy and drink wine outside home. This trend is also confirmed by the increasing presence in the market of the so called “wine bars”. These are places, popular among young people, where it’s possible <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>wine</b> by the glass along with eating some food and listening music. Therefore on this scientific paper we want to analyze the role of wine shops for the distribution and sale of quality wine. The survey was restricted to the city of Palermo and it was used a two-stage sampling. We analyzed a sample extracted (at the second stage), from the Population of wine shops of the first stage (the extraction procedure was random, at the first stage and reasoned, at the second stage). The questionnaire was submitted to wine shops’ holders/managers and contained closed questions. Through the use of Cluster Analysis it has been possible to classify the wine shop in groups, with homogeneity in number of bottles purchased, cost of purchasing and the chosen brands highlighting marketing choices of wine shops managers/holders focused on of quality wine. In general we were able to know the homogeneity of wine shops that sell quality wines...|$|E
