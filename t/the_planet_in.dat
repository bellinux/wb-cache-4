5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he {{observed the}} planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> 1616, further confusing him.|$|E

5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to visit Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in 1973, followed {{a year later}} by Pioneer11. Aside from taking the first close-up pictures of the planet, the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior. The Voyager1 and Voyager2 probes visited <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> 1979, and studied its moons and the ring system, discovering the volcanic activity ofIo {{and the presence of}} water ice on the surface of Europa. Ulysses further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000. The Cassini probe approached <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> 2000 and took very detailed images of its atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft passed by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its and its satellites' parameters.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E
5|$|Data and Picard {{discover}} a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic holodeck {{set up to}} recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> the process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the Prime Directive. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.|$|E

5|$|Samus {{lands on}} the surface of Zebes and explores the planet, {{traveling}} through the planet's caverns. She eventually comes across Kraid, an ally of the Space Pirates, and Ridley, the Space Pirates' commander, and defeats them both. Along the way, Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain. However, while Samus leaves <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> her gunship, it is attacked by Space Pirates, causing it to crash back onto Zebes, near the Space Pirate Mothership. Exploring the Mothership, Samus eventually reaches the Mecha Ridley, a mechanized form of Ridley. After defeating it, Samus escapes the planet using one of the Space Pirate's shuttles, while the Mothership self-destructs.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> <b>in</b> which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E

5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first observed <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} 17thcentury, {{he found it}} showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, {{and when it is}} closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, Samus defeats {{four of the}} Space Pirate bosses, {{including}} Kraid and Ridley, and {{arrives in}} Tourian—the heart of the Space Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has now grown to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of her energy before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges her energy and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the base's systems and all the enemy forces on Zebes. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam—an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetary self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes. If the player rescues the Dachora and the Etecoons—the creatures Samus encountered earlier in the game—during the escape, they are shown leaving <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> the distance.|$|E
5|$|Following Kid, {{the group}} infiltrates Viper Manor {{on the night}} of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while {{unraveling}} the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> prehistory and burrowed to its core. The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality. Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.|$|E

5|$|In the Grolier Codex captives {{are shown}} bound with cords leading to their necks, however {{the most common}} {{convention}} in Mesoamerican art is the depiction of captives bound by the arms or wrists. Some of the figures in the codex represent deities (on pages 1–2, 4–6 and 9) and some represent mortal warriors without supernatural attributes (on pages 3, 7 and 8). Both the deities and the mortals are performing the same actions such as the capture of a prisoner, or conquest symbolised by a spear passing through a temple. Although the codex depicts the stations of Venus, none of the warlike figures is identified with attributes normally associated with <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> Maya or central Mexican art. On page 9, a bound captive is depicted from a high point of view {{with a sense of}} perspective that French Mesoamericanist and iconographer Claude-François Baudez considers alien to Mesoamerican art. God K (K'awiil) is depicted twice in the codex. However, his attributes are inconsistent with other pre-Columbian depictions, as he is shown with human incisors instead of snake fangs.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{was named}} {{the way it was}} because it is home to the eighth {{planetary}} system confirmed {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA-directed program tasked with searching a region of the sky for terrestrial planets that transit, or cross in front of (and thereby, for a while, make dimmer) the stars that they orbit with respect to Earth. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> orbit around Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements. Kepler-8b's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., alongside planets in orbit around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, and Kepler-7.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> <b>in</b> a bid to {{become a kind of}} god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E
