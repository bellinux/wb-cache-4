5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert Dr. William M. Gray on April 4 predicted twelve named storms, {{with eight}} reaching hurricane strength {{and three of}} the eight reaching Category3 strength. <b>The</b> <b>prediction</b> issued on May 30 was similar, increasing the named storms to fourteen. The synoptic pattern of the season prior to June 1 resembled other previous seasons, with the 1952, 1954, 1964, 1966, and 1998 seasons considered the best analogs for the season. <b>The</b> <b>prediction</b> also included a 68%probability for a hurricane landfall along the United States.|$|E

5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of gravitational waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation {{of a pair of}} closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.

40|$|The null {{hypothesis}} in assessing earthquake predictions is often, loosely speaking, that <b>the</b> successful <b>predictions</b> are chance coincidences. To make this more precise requires specifying a chance model for <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> and/or <b>the</b> seismicity. The {{null hypothesis}} {{tends to be}} rejected not only when <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> have merit, but also when the chance model is inappropriate. In one standard approach, the seismicity is taken to be random and <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> are held fixed. "Conditioning" on <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> this way tends to reject the null hypothesis {{even when it is}} true, if <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> depend on <b>the</b> seismicity history. An approach that seems less likely to yield erroneous conclusions is to compare <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> with <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> of a"sensible" random prediction algorithm that uses seismicity up to time t to predict what will happen after time t.

5|$|Meteorology is a {{relatively}} young science {{and the study of}} tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.|$|E
5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prediction</b> {{that the}} CMB {{temperature}} was {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift.

40|$|The {{problem of}} precise {{evaluation}} of <b>the</b> perturbative QCD <b>predictions</b> at moderate energies is considered. Substantial renormalization scheme dependence of <b>the</b> perturbative <b>predictions</b> obtained with <b>the</b> conventional renormalization group improved perturbative approximants is discussed, using {{as an example}} the QCD effective charge appearing in the static interquark potential and the QCD corrections to the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule in the deep inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering. A new method for evaluating <b>the</b> QCD <b>predictions</b> at moderate energies is proposed, based on a modified couplant, which is constructed {{to be free from}} Landau singularity and less renormalization scheme dependent than the conventional couplant. The modified couplant contains an adjustable parameter, which may be used to improve <b>the</b> modified perturbative <b>predictions</b> in low orders by utilizing some information outside of perturbation theory. This parameter is fixed by matching <b>the</b> modified <b>predictions</b> to <b>the</b> phenomenological expression for the effective charge in the interquark potential. The renormalization scheme dependence of <b>the</b> perturbative <b>predictions</b> in <b>the</b> modified expansion is then discussed in detail, including <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> selected by <b>the</b> Principle of Minimal Sensitivity applied to the modified expansion.
