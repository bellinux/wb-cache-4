5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. <b>The</b> <b>arteries</b> of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. <b>The</b> <b>arteries</b> of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and <b>the</b> <b>arteries.</b> If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. <b>The</b> <b>arteries</b> are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through <b>the</b> <b>arteries,</b> which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E

25|$|Like the face, {{the human}} nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins, and thus {{supplied}} with abundant blood. The principal arterial blood-vessel {{supply to the}} nose is two-fold: (i) branches from <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> branch of <b>the</b> anterior ethmoid <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> branch of <b>the</b> posterior ethmoid <b>artery,</b> which derive from the ophthalmic artery; (ii) branches from <b>the</b> external carotid <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> sphenopalatine <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> greater palatine <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> superior labial <b>artery,</b> and <b>the</b> angular <b>artery.</b>|$|R

5|$|Celsus (25 BC– AD 14) {{described}} ligation and excision procedures, {{and discussed}} the possible complications. Galen advocated severing {{the connection of}} <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> to veins, claiming it reduced both pain {{and the spread of}} gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness. In the 13th century, European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan, Guy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and John of Ardene made great progress and development of the surgical techniques.|$|E

5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
50|$|In endarterectomy, {{the surgeon}} opens <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> and removes <b>the</b> plaque. The plaque forms and enlarges {{in the inner}} layer of <b>the</b> <b>artery,</b> or endothelium, hence {{the name of the}} {{procedure}} which simply means removal of the endothelium of <b>the</b> <b>artery.</b> A newer procedure, endovascular angioplasty and stenting, threads a catheter up from the groin, around the aortic arch, and up <b>the</b> carotid <b>artery.</b> <b>The</b> catheter uses a balloon to expand <b>the</b> <b>artery,</b> and inserts a stent to hold <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> open. In several clinical trials, the 30-day incidence of heart attack, stroke, or death was significantly higher with stenting than with endarterectomy (9.6% vs. 3.9%).|$|R

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall of one of <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the brain that becomes enlarged.

While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery dissection, {{a tear in}} <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in {{the neck}} which provide blood to the brain can result from {{rotation}} of the neck while the neck is extended.

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E

In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain {{and those of}} his parents. Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his planning ability. Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. <b>The</b> <b>arteries</b> {{at the base of}} his brain were small, but the significance of this finding was unclear. The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> trigeminal <b>artery</b> {{arises from}} <b>the</b> {{primitive}} {{internal carotid artery}} during development, when the embryo is approximately 6 weeks old. <b>The</b> trigeminal <b>artery</b> then anastomoses with <b>the</b> basilar <b>artery.</b> At this point in development, <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>artery</b> serves as <b>the</b> main blood supply for the hindbrain, as other vessels {{in the region have}} yet to mature. As <b>the</b> internal carotid <b>artery</b> branches more caudally to form <b>the</b> posterior communicating <b>artery,</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>artery</b> becomes less important in supplying blood and ultimately involutes. The time period from the initial development of <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> to its ultimate involution is only 7 to 10 days; if <b>the</b> <b>artery</b> has not involuted {{at the end of this}} period it persists into adulthood.|$|R

During his recovery he appeared as a pundit for ITV's coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Ranieri initiated a squad rotation system for the 2002–03 season, but focused the team around Gianfranco Zola, which limited Hasselbaink's playing time. Barcelona manager Louis van Gaal agreed an £8 million transfer for Hasselbaink in the January transfer window after months of negotiations but was dismissed before the transfer went through and the deal subsequently collapsed. Though the attack was focused on Zola throughout the season Hasselbaink managed to score 15 goals in 44 games, only one goal less than Zola.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relatives}} may be O.concolor {{from the}} northern Amazon rainforest, including northwestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia, and O.mamorae from Bolivia, Paraguay, nearby Brazil, and possibly northeastern Argentina. The three share a particular configuration of <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, and a general similarity in other traits. However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters. Whether the three species are truly closely related needs to be determined using molecular data.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of <b>the</b> <b>arteries</b> in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs.

5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions.
