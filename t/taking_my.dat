500|$|Nguyễn Ánh {{secretly}} left Siam {{and headed}} for southern Vietnam, but he failed in his first attempt to recapture Gia Dinh. He eventually succeeded in <b>taking</b> <b>Mỹ</b> Tho, made it the main staging point for his operations, and rebuilt his army. After a hard-fought battle, his soldiers captured Saigon on [...] 7 September 1788. Eventually, Pigneau assembled four vessels to sail to Vietnam from Pondicherry, arriving in Saigon on [...] 24 July 1789. The combined forces helped to consolidate Nguyễn Ánh's hold on southern Vietnam. The exact magnitude of foreign aid {{and the importance of}} their contribution to Gia Long's success is a point of dispute. Earlier scholars asserted that up to 400 Frenchmen enlisted, but more recent work has claimed that less than 100 soldiers were present, along with approximately a dozen officers.|$|E

She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album because of her youth and inexperience.|$|E

500|$|... "Early Winter" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Rice-Oxley, pianist of English {{alternative}} rock band Keane, and Gwen Stefani for the latter's second solo studio album The Sweet Escape (2006). The production of the song was handled by Nellee Hooper. Before working with Oxley in the studio, Stefani called him to discuss some of her ideas behind a potential song, saying [...] "I wanted a ballad. I wanted to write 'Eyes Without a Face' or 'Killing Me Softly' or 'Time After Time,' and he was like, 'OK, Cyndi Lauper, got it,' like he was <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> order." [...] In the studio, Oxley played [...] "Early Winter" [...] on a piano, and after hearing the song, Stefani approved of it and commented that [...] "It was so beautiful and addictive. I didn't really attack {{it because it was}} kind of done, lyrics and everything." [...] After letting the song [...] "sit with her for a bit", she rewrote some of the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010 Smith {{performed}} at various festivals and events.

[...] Appearances included the Mercedes-Benz World Summer Concert in Weybridge on 4 July, That Glorious Noise charity concert in aid of muscular dystrophy in Cleethorpes on 17 July and the Last Night of the Kenwood Proms on 21 August, {{as well as the}} wedding of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. Smith also opened the Serenata festival. Angela Young, reviewing the festival for the Bournemouth Daily Echo, said [...] "Faryl Smith was my personal highlight of the Thursday night line-up, her bizarrely powerful voice (considering her diminutive size and age) <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> breath away and it contrasted so well with her naivete as she said 'at least it's not raining' – just as the heavens opened." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{suffered a}} series of early misfortunes which hampered the first season's work and impaired preparations for the main polar march. On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic, Terra Nova nearly sank in a storm and was then trapped in pack ice for 20days, far longer than other ships had experienced, which meant a late-season arrival and less time for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter. At Cape Evans, Antarctica, one of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship, breaking through the sea ice and sinking. Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised ponies affected the initial depot-laying journey, so that the expedition's main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid [...] north of its planned location at 80°S. Lawrence Oates, {{in charge of the}} ponies, advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80°S, which Scott refused to do. Oates is reported as saying to Scott, [...] "Sir, I'm afraid you'll come to regret not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice." [...] Four ponies died during this journey either from the cold or because they slowed the team down and were shot.|$|E

500|$|The song, {{spanning}} {{three minutes}} and 21 seconds, {{begins with a}} one-measure opening guitar riff that alludes to the E major-pentatonic scale. Corgan uses this riff (along with variations on it) to emphasize certain parts and to indicate shifts in the song. After the riff is played four times, {{the rest of the}} band enters backed with feedback-driven guitars. Ned Raggett of Allmusic commented on the song's ability to [...] "alternate between calmer, almost Cure-like sections and the louder crunches, [...] soon-to-be-trademark guitar style <b>taking</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine's own hypnotic riffing to more accessible results." [...] The chorus, consisting of multiple guitar tracks playing barre chords, {{is an example of the}} band's tendency to overdub several rhythm guitar tracks. While the song does not include a standard guitar solo, a short melodic guitar part appears during the bridge. Corgan explained: [...] "The little guitar break over the C chord is actually a forwards sample that we laid in backwards. Then there's a weird vocal effect that moves across the speakers, a 'yan-yan-yan-yan' thing, which was generated by using a Roland Space Echo to regenerate on the last word of the vocal line, 'I wanna turn you on.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Olivia later {{viewed the}} {{recording}} of the album as a learning experience for her future music ventures; she said her time at the record label [...] "was cut short by {{the politics of the}} industry and me not actually <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> career into my own hands". She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album given her youth and inexperience. In her 2014 autobiography Release Me: My Life, My Words, Olivia wrote that she did not consider building a cohesive set of songs during the recording process and identified the album as lacking a clear direction. During promotion for the record, Olivia described having a good working relationship with Davis, but she called him [...] "extremely controlling" [...] after leaving the label. Olivia claimed that she was forced to be the bad girl while label mate Alicia Keys was promoted as the good girl. In an official statement, JRecords' representatives pointed to Olivia's credits as a co-writer for a majority of the album as proof of her involvement with the project and maintained: [...] "Clive doesn't categorize artists as good or bad girls". After her release from JRecords, American rapper 50 Cent and Interscope Geffen A Records chairman Jimmy Iovine signed Olivia to G-Unit Records. 50 Cent said he enjoyed Olivia's previous work and blamed J Records for sabotaging her career.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} more positive and uplifting lyrics {{in comparison with}} Green Day's earlier work. Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason why I was really <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E

500|$|On 3 July 1986, {{just before}} the start of the {{recording}} sessions for The Joshua Tree, Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly. The event shocked the entire band; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed." [...] Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton described it as [...] "a very sobering moment", saying, [...] "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've got left with them." [...] Bono said, [...] "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> bike home." [...] He later commented, [...] "it brought gravitas to the recording of The Joshua Tree. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much." [...] Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional Māori manner at Kai-iwi Marae near Whanganui, Carroll's hometown. Bono sang [...] "Let It Be" [...] and [...] "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" [...] for him at the funeral.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was overswinging and <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E
