500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not like her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, back at Lotus, Hill {{helped to}} develop the Lotus 49 with the new Cosworth-V8 engine. After {{teammates}} Jim Clark and Mike Spence were killed in early 1968, Hill led the team, and won his second world championship in 1968. The Lotus had a reputation of being very fragile and dangerous at that time, especially with the new aerodynamic aids which caused similar crashes of Hill and Jochen Rindt at the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix. A crash at the 1969 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen broke both his legs and interrupted his career. Typically, when asked soon after the crash {{if he wanted to}} pass on a message to his wife, Hill replied [...] "Just <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't be dancing for two weeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{collision}} with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April 1912, Navratil placed Michel and Edmond in Collapsible D, the last lifeboat successfully launched from the ship. Michel, although not quite {{four years old}} at the time, later claimed to remember his father telling him, [...] "My child, when your mother comes for you, as she surely will, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved her dearly and still do. Tell her I expected her to follow us, so that we might all live happily together in the peace and freedom of the New World." [...] The elder Navratil died in the sinking, and his body was recovered by the rescue ship, Mackay-Bennett. In his pocket was a revolver. Because of his assumed Jewish surname, he was buried in Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax, a Jewish cemetery in Nova Scotia.|$|E

6000|$|... "So!" [...] he cried, confronting Biarne, [...] "well met! Tell me, Biarne, didst thou {{poison the}} ears of Freydissa by <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been courting thy cousin Astrid?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> shrank from <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could be}} of no further use to her father, while he {{regarded}} me with an enmity which I had not deserved. But I saw no reason for concealing {{that it was my}} purpose to see Philip Dunboyne.|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. When {{that lady}} calls, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not {{expected}} home this evening. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been suddenly called out of town. You understand? ...|$|E
60|$|Arim. <b>Tell</b> <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> some {{certainty}} may bring, I go {{this minute}} {{to attend the}} king.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{one thing}} I was determined. If Bertha should ever again be brought {{near enough to}} hear me, I would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved her. The object of life, however much of it might be left me, should be to make Bertha know that I loved her. If I swam toward the vessel, or floated on a plank, I must get near enough to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved her.|$|E
6000|$|Rex broke down. He {{thought he}} discerned an {{intention}} fatal to his happiness, nay, his life. He {{was accustomed to}} believe in his father's penetration, and to expect firmness. [...] "Father, I can't go away without <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love <b>her,</b> and knowing <b>that</b> she loves me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{had your}} nerve!" [...] he said awed. [...] "What I should be feeling, if I {{were in your}} place and had to meet your mater after <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was engaged to marry a girl she had never seen, I don't know. I'd rather face a wounded tiger!" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{decided to}} use this room, {{on the second floor}} and {{overlooking}} the plaza, for Dejah Thoris and Sola, and another room adjoining and in the rear for the cooking and supplies. I then dispatched Sola to bring the bedding and such food and utensils as she might need, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would guard Dejah Thoris until her return.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If she has gone, and goes, {{her own way}} cheerfully,' he said, {{throwing}} the still unfolded letter on his desk, and putting his hands firmly in his pockets, 'you may <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> go as cheerfully on mine. If she has never once looked back, you may <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have, sometimes, to recall her taking part with you, and that my resolution is no easier to wear away;' he smiled very sweetly here; 'than marble.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So Mary is twenty-six! I say, David, she {{is getting}} on. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{coming in to}} kiss her when she is fifty-two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} take this to Miss Thurwell, and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am waiting, I think that she will see me," [...] she said quietly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{wanted to}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> could do {{anything}} at all, she had only to command.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you won't {{be drawn}} into the matter. I shall say enough to my aunt to satisfy <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am acting for the best, and shall simply, when I go, leave a note for your mistress, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have gone to work out an idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have had in my mind, {{and that it would}} be no use for her to inquire into the matter until she hears of me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Master, {{there were}} no other reasons, unless the Cup, when it is awake, remembers what it has held in trance, which I do not believe. I wooed her as <b>I</b> was, not <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am also King of the Ethiopians, or any more than I seem to be. Moreover the holy Tanofir told her nothing, for he swore as much to me and he does not lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kindly take my card to Mrs. Porter and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{must see}} her at once on {{a matter of}} the utmost urgency," [...] he directed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite!' she says. 'Only give Agnes my dear love, and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want very, very, {{much to see}} her; and I {{have nothing}} left to wish for.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens alive!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} to herself. [...] "Now I {{have to find}} Aunt Molly and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to Europe to-morrow with a perfect stranger!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR PETER, Where is Ogden? We {{have been}} expecting him every day. Mrs Ford is {{worrying}} herself to death. She keeps {{asking me if}} I have any news, {{and it is very}} tiresome to have to keep <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not heard from you. Surely, with the opportunities you must get every day, you can manage to kidnap him. Do be quick. We are relying on you.--In haste, [...] CYNTHIA.|$|R
60|$|Well however, being unconcern'd {{whether she}} kept her Word or no, <b>I</b> began, by <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not long since obtain'd the second sight, and had some years studied Magic, by which I could {{penetrate}} into many things, which to ordinary Perception were invisible, and had some Glasses, by the Help of which I could see into all visionary or imaginary Appearances in a different Manner than other People did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then make haste. Come to-morrow. Come and <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{may have}} some peace from her scolding and--perhaps--who knows [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Swallow, {{flying from}} the golden woods, [...] Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, {{and make her}} mine, [...] And tell her, <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> follow thee.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{will not}} marry the capitaine; that I will not give up your promises; and then I am ready to leave the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kilcullen. [...] "I have bid {{her good}} bye. But give her my kindest love, and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did what I told her I would do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hullah's {{daughter}} (an artist) {{tells me}} that certain female students have addressed the Royal Academy, entreating them {{to find a place}} for their education. I think it a capital move, for which I can do something popular and telling in The Register. Adelaide Procter is active in the business, and has a copy of their letter. Will you write to <b>her</b> for <b>that,</b> and anything else she may have about it, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> strongly approve, and want to help them myself? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had I {{come on the}} {{previous}} day, and had I been able then to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> now, would it have made no difference?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And for me," [...] Mrs. Lowder insisted. [...] "She's not {{therefore}} {{so stupid}} {{as not to}} do justice to grounds so marked. You can <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> perfectly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had asked you to say nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{to her a}} word of {{kindness}} from me;--a word {{of kindness}}. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have forgiven her, but tell her also that man's forgiveness will avail her nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the most}} trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I {{come in at}} ten minutes to nine and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must be dressed by half-past eight." ...|$|E
60|$|How I {{longed to}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would give {{ten years of}} my life to remain in England: that duty to John Paul took me home. But I was dumb.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{suppose you}} could not have had it. I wrote before I started out three months ago from Salt Lake City. I had struck a ledge of pretty good stuff, I and another. We sold out for a {{thousand}} dollars, and I sent my share off to your mother, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been having bad luck since I got <b>her</b> letter, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hoped to do better in future, and I thought, anyhow, I could promise to send her as much once a year, and if I had a real stroke of luck she and her girls would {{have the benefit of}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind; you <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> She won't bite you. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> also <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{shall be}} over at Granpere soon {{to see her}} {{and the rest of}} them. I'll be over--as soon as ever I can get away.' ...|$|R
60|$|As it was {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might be absent for some little time, I arranged with Marian that we were to correspond every day--of course addressing each other by assumed names, for caution's sake. As long as I heard from her regularly, <b>I</b> should assume <b>that</b> nothing was wrong. But if the morning came and brought me no letter, my return to London would take place, {{as a matter of}} course, by the first train. I contrived to reconcile Laura to my departure by <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to the country to find new purchasers for her drawings and for mine, and I left her occupied and happy. Marian followed me downstairs to the street door.|$|R
