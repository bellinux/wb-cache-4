In the last decade, the utilization of hydrocarbons as reducing agents has received much attention for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitric oxide. Using CH 4 as the reducing agent for SCR of NO 2 has particularly attracted interest, owing to the fact that methane exists in nearly all of the combustion exhausts. This paper summarized the advance in SCR of NO 2 with methane in recent years. The status of the catalysts for CH 4 -SCR of NOx including metal-exchanged zeolites and metal oxides was also introduced. The reaction mechanism was also discussed, and it was indicated that the formation of NO 2 was the key step for CH 4 -SCR of NOx.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{linguistic}} analysis of requirements written in French {{for a project}} {{carried out by the}} French National Space Agency (CNES). The aim is to determine to what extent they conform to some of the rules laid down in INCOSE, a recent guide for writing requirements, with a focus on the notion of sentence " comprehensibility ". Although CNES engineers are not obliged to follow any Controlled Natural Language, we believe that language regularities are likely to emerge from this task, mainly due to the writers' experience. As a first step, we use natural language processing tools to identify sentences that do not comply with INCOSE rules. We further review these sentences to understand why the recommendations cannot (or should not) always be applied when specifying large-scale projects, and how they could be improved. This paper presents a corpus linguistics approach applied to <b>the</b> <b>melioration</b> <b>of</b> requirements writing. We propose a linguistic diagnosis of the way requirements are written in a space project by comparing these requirements with a guide for writing specifications (a controlled natural language). Initial results obtained from this analysis suggest that guides for writing specifications are not fully adapted to the real writing process: they are sometimes too constraining, and sometimes insufficiently so. In the medium term, the aim is to propose another guide based on the spontaneous regularities observed in requirements. The paper comprises two parts.

Revisionist historians often cite highly selective textual passages or phrases in which these groups are negatively portrayed. By systematically reprinting many complete paragraphs, this study presents the argumentative tone and logic of forty-two authors from southern New England including Nathaniel Hawthorne. Such an approach preserves the literary intent of each piece (negative or positive). ^ How blacks, Native Americans, and women were treated in dozens of southern New England antebellum textbooks is examined in this inquiry. Such writings offer a diversity of opinion regarding these educational subjects. Some abolitionist authors viewed blacks and Native Americans as human beings with civil rights, while other writers regarded these two groups as being barbaric and racially inferior to whites. Many textbooks depict women as educable, self-reliant individuals; gender-biased works, however, present women as subservient. Several women authored textbooks, but members of other minorities did not. Massachusetts and Connecticut white males wrote most antebellum textbooks; Rhode Islanders produced few if any. ^ Educators enhance their professional lives by learning the backgrounds of their students. Studying educational history likewise prepares better teachers. By examining the histories of how multicultural groups such as blacks, Native Americans, and women have been portrayed in past textbooks, educators become more proficient in guiding their students towards greater intercultural sensitivity and appreciation. ...|$|E

U tom kratkom vremenskom razdoblju, zbog ratnih prilika, posebna je pozornost posvećena fortifikacijama i kopnenim komunikacijama potrebnih u vojne svrhe. Posebna je pozornost posvećena urbanističkim problemima Splita i njegovim antičkim spomenicima. Amidst horrendous war turmoil {{throughout}} Europe, {{following the}} decline of the Republic of Venice in 1798, and a short-lasting Austrian government, the French ruled Dalmatia from 1806 to 1913. New government attempted to improve economic, educational and other areas in that underdeveloped region. In terms of construction, due to tumultuous times, most work was done on military-related facilities. Obsolete city walls were torn down in some cities since they were used as enemy fortresses, however, at the same time, it made cities more beautiful and health conditions improved considerably. Strong English fleet appeared in the Adriatic and turned Vis into its operation base, occupying and disabling navigation, thus the French authorities built a road to ensure communication between certain parts. Other roads were also built, since there had hardly been any roads in the region. At first, Napoleon attempted to build marine bases for its fleet in well protected waters of Dubrovnik. He erected the fortress Imperial on the Srđ hill above the city, and fortress Real on the small island of Lokrum outside the port. Great attention was devoted to <b>the</b> <b>melioration</b> <b>of</b> marshy terrains. They needed experts for all planned extensive construction works. Therefore the study of architecture was initiated at the Lyceum, which was also later founded in the Central School of Zadar in 1806. The head professor was Basilio Mazzoli who was appointed in 1807. Some of his prominent students were Vicko Andrić from Trogir and Petar Pekota from Zadar. Marshall Auguste de Marmont, the military governor of Dalmatia, strived to embellish the cities by creating free spaces where the torn down city walls used to be. He especially liked Split, where he tastefully arranged the public garden and extended the waterfront. He intended to embellish that part of the city by constructing representative buildings; therefore he hired Mazzoli who designed projects that were never later used. Upon Napoleon`s defeat, Dalmatia was allotted to Austria following the decision of the Congress of Vienna from 1815. Neoclassicism was still present in the region to a certain extent. The famous architect Giannantonio Selva from Venice left his works thanks to a great erudite from Trogir, Giovanni Luca Garagnin. He designed him several projects for economic buildings, one of which was the summer house in the nearby Divulje. Building construction was more prolific in Zadar, the capital of the region at the time. One of the most prominent works of the time is the reconstruction of the Bishop`s Palace. The first proposal came from Hatzinger; then the architect Luigi de Romano, who came from Venice as the administrator of the Civil Engineering Department at the Regency, submitted a new proposal. The final project was designed in 1830. De Romano designed the building of the regional court. During 1826 the architect Valentino Presani came to Zadar and obtained a position in civil service, which he held for twelve years. He represented the focus of civil engineering in the city and its surroundings. He designed numerous projects of which only few were realised; one of those is the building of investigative detention unit and the expansion of the west wing of the St. Krševan monastery. His most mature work is the chapel of St. Frane in Podprag on Velebit. In Dalmatia, the traces of Neoclassicism are present until very late. In 1868, the architect Perikle Koludrović designed a project for the new hospital building in Split...|$|E

(COD) on the DKD model, which was established by unilateral nephrectomy (UN)-high fat diet feeding (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ). After the DKD rats were oral treated with COD at a dose of 2.7  mg/kg for 4 consecutive weeks, the blood glucose, lipid metabolism, renal function, inflammatory mediators, and fibrosis-associated proteins were examined. In vivo, the COD administration obviously relieved the weight loss, water intake, and blood glucose; decreased the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; and improved the renal function by reducing the expression of serum creatinine, uric acid, and urinary protein compared with the model group. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 1 β, and IL- 6 were significantly inhibited by COD. Meanwhile, the deposition of collagen fiber was markedly increased, and the protein and mRNA expressions of transforming growth factor-β 1 and α-smooth muscle actin were markedly elevated in DKD rats, but they were decreased to some extent after the COD treatment. In conclusion, COD exhibited a protective effect on the UN-HFD feeding combined with STZ-induced DKD model by improving the blood glucose and lipid metabolism, relieving the inflammatory response, and mitigating the renal fibrosis, which provided scientific evidence for its applications in clinic.|$|R
