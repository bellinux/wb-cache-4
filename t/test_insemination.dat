A challenge in this context, is to produce male mosquitoes that will be able to compete and mate with wild females more efficiently than their wild counterparts, i. e. high fitness males. This study explored the effect of three larval food diets developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency on the overall fitness and mating performance of male Anopheles gambiae s. s. mosquitoes (Kisumu strain). Larval development (pupation and emergence rate, development time) was monitored, and adult wing length and energy reserves at emergence (i. e. lipids, sugars, glycogen and proteins) were measured. Male sexual performance was assessed through an <b>insemination</b> <b>test</b> whereby one male and 10 virgin females were maintained together in the same cage in order to record the number of inseminated females per 24 h. Our results show that males reared on Diets 2 and 3 performed best during larval development. Males provided with treatment 2. 2 had a shorter development time and performed best in <b>insemination</b> <b>tests.</b> However, these males had the lowest overall lifespan, suggesting a trade-off between longevity and sexual performances which needs to be taken into consideration when planning release.

40|$|Abstract Background A genome wide {{association}} {{study for}} litter size in Norwegian White Sheep (NWS) was conducted using the recently developed ovine 50 K SNP chip from Illumina. After genotyping 378 progeny <b>tested</b> artificial <b>insemination</b> (AI) rams, a GWAS {{analysis was performed}} on estimated breeding values (EBVs) for litter size. Results A QTL-region was identified on sheep chromosome 5, close to the growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF 9), which {{is known to be}} a strong candidate gene for increased ovulation rate/litter size. Sequencing of the GDF 9 coding region in the most extreme sires (high and low BLUP values) revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (c. 1111 G>A), responsible for a Val→Met substitution at position 371 (V 371 M). This polymorphism has previously been identified in Belclare and Cambridge sheep, but was not found to be associated with fertility. In our NWS-population the c. 1111 G>A SNP showed stronger association with litter size than any other single SNP on the Illumina 50 K ovine SNP chip. Based on the estimated breeding values, daughters of AI rams homozygous for c. 1111 A will produce minimum 0. 46 - 0. 57 additional lambs compared to daughters of wild-type rams. Conclusion We have identified a missense mutation in the bioactive part of the GDF 9 protein that shows strong association with litter size in NWS. Based on the NWS breeding history and the marked increase in the c. 1111 A allele frequency in the AI ram population since 1983, we hypothesize that c. 1111 A allele originate from Finnish landrace imported to Norway around 1970. Because of the widespread use of Finnish landrace {{and the fact that the}} ewes homozygous for the c. 1111 A allele are reported to be fertile, we expect the commercial impact of this mutation to be high. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Today a {{great deal}} of {{research}} is focused on the development of new extenders that allow the refrigeration and maintenance of rabbit semen {{for a longer period of}} time. In this study, semen diluted with 3 different extenders (A, B, and C) and stored at two different temperatures (4 °C and 38 °C) were evaluated using both laboratory and in vivo tests. The best results were obtained with extender C (INRA 96) which, in the first 10 h of the test at 4 °C, displayed about 80 % higher motility compared to the other two extenders and preserved optimal seminal fluid motility for over 34 h after dilution. In the test at 38 °C, the motility of semen diluted with extender C was 52 % in the fifth h vs 21 % of the semens diluted with extenders A (Lepus) and B (Verdunnungsmischung). Another <b>test</b> involved artificial <b>insemination</b> (AI) of 1800 lactating does using refrigerated semen diluited with the extenders under study. The fertility rate and litter size obtained with semen diluted with extender C was higher (78. 1 % and 8. 65, respectively) than those obtained with extenders A (71. 2 % and 8. 15, respectively) and B (71. 05 % and 8. 13, respectively) in both parallel and sequential tests.

40|$|In 1990 the {{organizations}} responsible for Finnish dairy breeding established an open nucleus multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) breeding program called ASMO. The aim was, besides to test effectiveness of MOET, {{to improve the}} protein to fat ratio in milk produced by Finnish Ayrshires but without sacrificing the progress in protein yield. The relative weights of traits were such that equal importance was assigned to protein % and protein yield. Negative weight was assigned to fat % to ensure it remained unaltered. The MOET work continued until 1994 after which the performance of selected animals has been monitored. During the five years the scheme operated, 276 cows were flushed for embryos, and 2751 embryos were recovered, of which 1810 were transferable. More than 1600 embryos were transferred to recipients, and 813 calves were born. Eighty bull calves were sold for the artificial <b>insemination</b> <b>test</b> scheme. In December 1995 the first 125 ET daughters were evaluated with the national animal model program. Their mean estimated breeding values (EBVs) were + 0. 13 for protein % and - 0. 18 for fat % compared with the genetic base of progeny tested sires born in 1986 - 1988, and the protein yield EBVs were 12 kg above the genetic base. Despite the efficiency of selection, the program was discontinued in 1994.

40|$|Superovulation {{hormonal}} {{treatments and}} the sub-sequent embryo collection techniques from donor ewes have {{become one of}} the most efficient tools to improve genetic programs and recover endangered livestock breeds. Several attempts to optimize these procedures have focused on easing hormone administration protocols and increasing the number of transferable embryos per donor ewe. Forcada et al. (2000) developed a system to obtain the maximum number of embryos of high genetic value involving identification of the best females for a given character, and their use as embryo donors when they are candidates for culling for non-reproductive reasons. This particular treatment involves the superovulation up to three times at 60 -day intervals before euthanasia. Later on, a simplif ied protocol to administer porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) (one single injection of pFSH and equine chorionic gonadotropin [eCG] vs. six decrea-sing doses of pFSH) was developed with comparable results (Simmonetti et al., 2008; Forcada et al., 2011 a). This protocol has also been <b>tested</b> using intrauterine <b>insemination</b> (Forcada et al., 2012). The efficiency of in vivo embryo production decreases significantly after the f irst superovulatory treatment (Forcada et al., 2011 a).

40|$|Conservation of {{indigenous}} poultry species {{is an important}} part of the new Hungarian agricultural strategy. Semen cryopreservation is the most practical method for the long term storage of poultry genetic material. The objective was to compare four protocols for cryopreservation of guinea fowl sperm (slow and fast programmable, freezing in nitrogen vapor, and pellet) and three cryoprotectants (10 % ethylene glycol, 6 % dimethyl-formamide and 6 % dimethyl-acetamide). The efficiency of the methods was examined by in vitro tests (subjective motility scoring, sperm concentration, morphological and live/dead sperm analysis with eosin-aniline staining). Thereafter, the two most promising methods were <b>tested</b> by artificial <b>insemination</b> of frozen-thawed semen (3 times a week for 3 weeks using 300 million spermatozoa/hen), followed by candling of incubated eggs, assessment of fertilization, embryonic death, and hatching rate. The survival rate of live, intact spermatozoa was greatest (p# 0. 05) in pellet method and the slow programmable protocol (with 10 % ethylene glycol) (28. 6 and 23. 5 %). The two best protocols (based on in vitro assessment of post-thaw semen quality) were subsequently tested in vivo with artificial insemination. The pellet method yielded a 64 % fertility rate compared to slow protocol with only 30 % fertility. Regardless, both freezing protocols significantly increased embryonic deaths compared to the control group (16, 7; 9, 1 and 8, 3 %, respectively). During the 3 -week in vivo trial, fertility increased and early embryonic death decreased over time. According to the results the guinea fowl sperm could tolerate the fast freezing in pellet better than the slower freezing rates and resulted acceptable fertility rate...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of two energy supplements based on propylene glycol in dairy cows diet on ovarian and follicular morphology, conception, insemination index and length of service period. A total number of 60 Holstein Friesian dairy cows, parity between 2 - 8, with an average milk production of 7000 kg/ 305 days of lactation were divided into three experimental groups (20 dairy cows per group). The first group of dairy cows was supplemented daily with "Energy-plus" (O 1 group; 200 mL propylene-glycol supplement) and the second group was supplemented with "Ketal" (O 2 group; 160 mL propylene-glycol supplement), two weeks before partus until 30 days post partum. The third experimental group were non supplemented dairy cows (O 3, control group). Ultrasound examination of the reproductive system using real time echo camera Falco VET 100 (ESAOTE PieMedical, Holland, B-shaped scan with linear-array endorectal 5 - 8 MHz probe) was conducted on every animal starting from day 40 postpartum. The diameters of the ovaries (left and right) and of the dominant follicle(s) were recorded. Ultrasound testing was repeated on day 50 and 60 postpartum only in cows which in the meantime were not inseminated. Reproduction efficiency parameters (conception rate, number of inseminations and length of service period) were recorded individually. The statistical significance of the differences between groups was tested using ANOVA with LSD test at the level of significance p< 0. 05, chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (the length of service period). There was no significant impact of the propylene glycol supplementation on the ovarian and follicular morphology at the first ultrasound examination. At the second ultrasound examination {{there was a significant difference}} between left ovarian dominant follicle diameter in the control and supplemented dairy cows (1. 67 ± 0. 53 vs 1. 12 ± 0. 29 and 1. 11 ± 0. 35 cm, p< 0. 05, O 3 vs O 1 and O 2, respectively). The cumulative percentage of conception after the first and second insemination was 60 %, 81 % and 25 % in groups O 1, O 2 and O 3, respectively (p< 0. 05, chi-square <b>test).</b> The <b>insemination</b> index was lowest in group O 2 and statistically significant differences were found between groups O 2 and O 3 (1. 69 ± 0. 79 : 3. 38 ± 1. 36, respectively, p< 0, 05). The length of the service period was significantly (p< 0. 05, LSD test) shorter in the O 2 group (100 ± 35 days) compared to groups O 1 and O 3 (168 ± 59 and 157 ± 52 days, respectively), that was confirmed by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of days open periods. The use of propylene glycol supplement in dairy cows diet during peripartal period induced higher percentage of pregnancy rates after the first and second insemination, significantly shortened the length of the service period and reduced the insemination index...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that {{assisted}} reproductive techniques are implemented and used worldwide in livestock production, having as aim to allow high genetic animals to produce more descendants in a shorter period of time than possible naturally. They have enabled animal breeders to optimize production and reproduction efficiency of their animals by improving selective traits and accelerating the genetic progress. Artificial insemination techniques in sheep increase the selection differential, being one of the main biotechnologies that are used extensively in the animal livestock. The present research has in view to assess the influence of collection techniques upon some morph metric parameters of the ram sperm. There were analyzed 10 native purebred and crossbred rams from different age category. The semen collection was made by artificial vagina and with the aid of electro ejaculator. At every semen collection, there were recorded the main morphologic features of sperm and also the primary morph metric head sperm indices: head length, head width, head area and head perimeter. The influence of the collection technique was in view along two years, studying the dynamics of the analyzed sperm indices through the computer image analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed on the recorded data to determine normality. Statistical analysis was performed as per standard statistical methods. The results reveal {{the fact that there were}} no morph metric differences between the two collection methods. The lack of significant differences indicated that other factors may affect the reproduction efficiency between the two methods. The study clearly demonstrates that there is a variation in reproductive parameters in the rams which could be studied at the molecular level to unveil any genomic markers associated with low fertility and/or infertility. The results obtained for this part of the overall study emphasizes further research to correlate morph metric traits of ram sperm with conception rate of ewes to determine whether morph metric traits need to be included in sperm quality <b>tests</b> for artificial <b>inseminations...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of temperament on the quality and efficiency of handling and on the pregnancy rate of Nellore cows submitted to a fixed time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocol. Temperament and handling procedures were simultaneously assessed in 798 Nellore cows on the first (d 0), ninth (d 9) and 11 th days (d 11) of the FTAI protocol, using the flight speed (FS) and crush score (CS) <b>tests.</b> During the <b>insemination</b> process performed on d 11 of the FTAI protocol, the following handling indicators were recorded: rough or overly aggressive handling of the cows by stockpersons (AGGRESSION), accidents (ACCIDENT), time to inseminate (TIME), and the degree of dirtiness on cows’ perineal region (DIRTINESS). There was a significant effect of CS on TIME (P= 0. 013) and DIRTINESS (P= 0. 004), while FS tended to affect TIME (P= 0. 06) and the likelihood of AGGRESSION (P= 0. 07). Cows subjected to aggressive handling and/or accidents had a greater FS mean than cows that did not face such aversive situations (2. 07 ± 1. 18 vs. 1. 74 ± 0. 75 m/s, P= 0. 0003). The chance of pregnancy (expressed in odds ratio) was greater in cows with low FS (OR= 1. 48) than in cows with high FS (defined as the reference class, with OR= 1) (χ 2 = 3. 73, P= 0. 05), and the low FS group had 10 % more pregnant cows than the high FS group (with 52. 59 % vs. 42. 62 % pregnant cows, respectively). Pregnant cows had significantly lower FS means relative to non-pregnant cows on d 0 (1. 79 vs. 2. 10 m/s, P< 0. 001), d 9 (1. 67 m/s vs. 1. 79 m/s, P= 0. 038) and d 11 (1. 70 m/s vs. 1. 90 m/s, P= 0. 004). We conclude that excitable temperament has an effect on the quality and efficiency of handling during FTAI, by increasing the time required for insemination, the dirtiness on cows’ perineal region and the likelihood of aggressive actions by stockpersons. Also, cattle temperament measured by FS reduces the chance of pregnancy in Nellore beef cows...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the title}} of this book might be {{somewhat}} misleading-it {{has little to do with}} daily ranch life and is certainly not a systematic historical study-nevertheless its idiosyncrasies convey a wealth of fascinating information in an extremely readable format. The author, a former Canadian rancher who has since retired to the sunny south of Montana, spent three years traveling, discussing ranching with old friends and new acquaintances, taping interviews, and collecting his research into two thousand pages of single spaced typing. From this mass of information he has crafted an overview of twentieth-century ranching, most of it in the words of nearly eighty informants, whom he terms 2 ̆ 2 characters. 2 ̆ 2 These characters include ranchers from Canada to Mexico, as well as scientists from all over the continent and England as well. Ewing has chosen four major areas-The Way Things Were, The Age of Growth, The Invasion, and The Importation. The first deals with the tendency back in the 1930 s to downsize cattle, an era when top prizes at livestock shows were awarded strictly on the subjective basis of 2 ̆ 2 looks, 2 ̆ 2 not on performance. The second section covers the post-war period when scientific innovations such as performance <b>testing</b> and artificial <b>insemination</b> were becoming a part of the beef industry. The third examines the Mexican influence on Canada and the United States, both with the importation of Charolais and the problems of foot and mouth disease. The final section discusses the many exotic breeds that have come into North America and looks forward to a future where advances in embryo transplant and genetic manipulation technology suggest unpredictable changes to the cattle industry. Although these topics sound dry in a mere listing, they come alive in the words of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 s characters and in his own introductory comments. Here, in the real language of the real men and women of the range, one learns at the grassroots level how innovation and change occur in ranching, how interest in new breeds and new techniques can overcome the skepticism of neighbors or the scientific community. Jim Gray, for instance, one of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 s neighbors in the Porcupine Hills of Alberta, found out about a good line of performance tested bulls while 2 ̆ 2 rubbering 2 ̆ 2 (i. e., listening in) on the party line while Ewing talked to a Montana rancher. Then he went to Montana and bought several of the bulls, paying cash for them with twelve hundred American silver dollars. Ewing says he likes all breeds of cattle, although Charolais and other exotics seem to be favorites. But his mind is open and inquisitive, and he has shaped his material, though in the words of others, into a coherent whole. His next project, hinted at in an epilogue, is to visit those who buy the ranchers 2 ̆ 7 product 2 ̆ 2 the butchers, the tanners, the pharmacists, the chemists, the artists and artisans of every trade. 2 ̆ 2 I look forward to reading the book that will result, as well as his first book, The Range...|$|R
