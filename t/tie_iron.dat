50|$|Before the {{railroad}} construction could get fully started, {{the island was}} connected to the Panamanian mainland by a causeway supported by pile-driven timbers. The first rolling stock consisting of a steam locomotive built by William Sellers & Co., and several gondola cars arrived in February 1851. The required steam locomotives, railroad cars, ties, rails, and other equipment were unloaded at the newly constructed docks and driven across the track laid across the about 200 yd causeway separating the island from the mainland. This causeway connected the Atlantic terminus to {{the railroad}} and allowed the <b>ties,</b> <b>iron</b> rails, steam engines, workers, backfill, and other construction material to be hauled onto the mainland. Later, passengers and freight would go the same way. As the railroad progressed, {{more and more of the}} island was filled in, and the causeway was expanded to permanently connect the island to the mainland; its island status disappeared and the town of Aspinwall was created.|$|R
50|$|It is a one-story front-gabled, brick {{commercial}} structure made of hand-made bricks {{on a rock}} foundation. Its {{brick walls}} are18 in thick, laid in American bond. It has <b>iron</b> <b>tie</b> rods.|$|R
5000|$|The Turnpike {{bridge was}} {{probably}} a King Through Truss, in which a timber A-frame provides the compression members, with wrought <b>iron</b> <b>tie</b> bars underneath; this design gives the best (least) depth of construction.|$|R
50|$|Vitruvius further {{states that}} the stone blocks of opus isodomum are bound {{together}} by mortar, but more often they are not connected with mortar but with metal <b>ties</b> such as <b>iron</b> cramps, fixed in stone blocks with molten lead.|$|R
2500|$|The diagonals {{and lower}} chord have {{rectangular}} eyebars [...] wide. Round bars {{are used for}} the counters and sway braces. The <b>ties</b> are on <b>iron</b> s riveted to transverse iron floor beams. Both portals are decorated with quatrefoil brackets and finials.|$|R
50|$|Modern-day Pottstown is {{established}} on land originally deeded to William Penn. Germans, Swedes and English {{were among the}} first European settlers in the area. After establishment of the first iron forge in 1714, Pottstown's fortunes became <b>tied</b> to the <b>iron</b> industry.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{roof was}} designed by Sir John Hawkshaw and comprised a single-span trussed arch with wrought <b>iron</b> <b>tie</b> rods. The roof was 164 ft wide by 510 ft long and {{was designed as a}} contained arch, with bowstring principals.|$|R
50|$|The ancient stone coffin with <b>iron</b> <b>ties</b> is {{enshrined}} {{in an open}} space above the altar. In 1934 his most faithful brothers were entombed {{in the corners of}} the wall around the altar: Brother Rufino, Brother Angelo, Brother Masseo and Brother Leo.|$|R

50|$|The Dee Bridge {{disaster}} was a rail {{accident that}} occurred on 24 May 1847 in Chester with five fatalities. It revealed {{the weakness of}} cast iron beam bridges reinforced by wrought <b>iron</b> <b>tie</b> bars, and brought criticism of its designer, Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson.|$|R
5000|$|Iron (Fe) {{deficiency}} is a plant disorder {{also known}} as [...] "lime-induced chlorosis". It can be confused with manganese deficiency. A deficiency in the soil is rare but iron can be unavailable for absorption if soil pH is not between about 5 and 6.5. A common problem is excessive alkalinity of the soil (the pH is above 6.5). Also, iron deficiency can develop if the soil is too waterlogged or has been overfertilised. Elements like calcium, zinc, manganese, phosphorus, or copper can <b>tie</b> up <b>iron</b> if they are present in high amounts.|$|R
50|$|Hockenhull Platts {{consists}} of three humpback bridges which are approached and connected by causeways. The bridges are constructed from tooled blocks of red sandstone. The parapets are plain and are surmounted by chamfered coping stones which are joined by <b>iron</b> <b>ties.</b> The carriageway is formed from a mixture of stone setts and cobbles.|$|R
50|$|When Cuéllar {{crawled out}} he saw 800 corpses {{littering}} the sand, with ravens and wild dogs feeding on them. He {{moved on to}} the Abbey of Staad, a small church which had been torched by the English after its friars had fled. He saw twelve of his countrymen hanging from nooses <b>tied</b> to <b>iron</b> bars of the windows within the church ruins. A local woman who was driving cattle into hiding in the woods warned him {{to stay out of the}} road, and he then met two naked Spanish soldiers, who informed him that English soldiers had killed 100 captive survivors.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Peterkin had thinned down his spear, and <b>tied</b> an <b>iron</b> point very cleverly {{to the end}} of it; I had formed a sling, the lines of which were {{composed}} of thin strips of the cocoa-nut cloth, plaited; and Jack had made a stout bow, nearly five feet long, with two arrows, feathered with two or three large plumes which some bird had dropped. They had no barbs; but Jack said that if arrows were well feathered they did not require iron points, but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the point, which I did not know before.|$|R

50|$|In the 17th {{century the}} bridge was often in a ruined state but was {{repaired}} several times with funds raised by tolls levied on users. In 1697 Thomas Bauchop, a mason, received a contract for repairs from the Earl of Mar. In that year he or his son, Alloa Master Mason Tobias Bauchop, built a new eastern arch and inserted <b>iron</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the {{interior}} of the nave are lined vertically with silky oak v-jointed tongue and groove boards and the boards to the ceiling are laid along its length. From the wall the ceiling follows the line of the rafters, then the pitch is reduced up to a central section of flat ceiling. A pair of <b>iron</b> <b>tie</b> rods provide structural stability.|$|R
50|$|The {{monolith}} {{was originally}} a grave marker, erected in the 2nd century AD {{to honor the}} memory of Marcus Valerius Verus, the duumvir (mayor) of Roman Poetovio. In the Middle Ages, it {{was used as a}} pillory. Criminals were <b>tied</b> to the <b>iron</b> rings attached to its lower part. Since March 2008, it has the status of a national cultural monument.|$|R
5000|$|The line is 4.6 km long, climbs a {{vertical}} distance of 1629 m, and is of [...] gauge. Because of the rack-system, {{there are no}} conventional points or switches on the line, only rotary switches (see photograph) and traversers. All railway is laid on solid rock, securing rails by high-strength <b>iron</b> <b>ties</b> attached to the rock, without using any ballast.|$|R
5000|$|The beams {{were cast}} in a [...] "turtle back profile" [...] to give the {{required}} strength, at minimum weight. They were supported by cast iron columns, erected {{on top of each}} other. The lateral thrust of the brick arches was resisted by concealed wrought <b>iron</b> <b>ties</b> between the column tops. The building was 15 bays wide, and the wings six bays wide.|$|R
50|$|Buxlow Manor is a grade II* listed {{house in}} Knodishall, Suffolk, England. It is built of red brick {{and has been}} dated to 1678 from the {{markings}} on the <b>iron</b> <b>ties</b> in the main gables. It has also been known as Ghost House, Ghost Hole, and Red House Farm. The land and former house were once owned by John Cordebouef who died in 1300.|$|R
50|$|The facing of the piers {{consists}} of local granite ashlar, set in parallel courses {{without the use}} of mortar or <b>iron</b> <b>ties</b> (opus quadratum); their interior, as those of the ramps, was filled with Roman concrete, a common method applied for Roman bridges. Outwardly, the flattened arches must have lent the bridge a rather elongated appearance, with its roadway following a horizontal or slightly convex line.|$|R
5000|$|In England {{during the}} time of Queen Anne, bull-baiting was practised in London at Hockley-in-the-Hole, twice a week [...] - [...] and was also {{reasonably}} common in provincial towns. At Tutbury, a bull was <b>tied</b> to an <b>iron</b> stake so that it could move within a radius of about 30 feet. The object of the sport was for the dogs to immobilise the bull.|$|R
50|$|By 1870 {{the tower}} was leaning {{away from the}} building, and {{emergency}} repairs were undertaken to secure it to {{the fabric of the}} building with <b>iron</b> <b>ties.</b> However, the church deteriorated further, and an architects report in 1897 outlined the dangerous condition of the building. The top of the tower was removed in 1902, and the last service in the old building was held on Easter Day, 1903.|$|R
