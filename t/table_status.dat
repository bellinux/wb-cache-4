40|$|Categorical {{variables}} such as water <b>table</b> <b>status</b> are often predicted using the indicator kriging (IK) formalism. However, this method is known to suffer from important limitations that are most frequently solved by ad hoc solutions and approximations. Recently, the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) approach has proved its ability to predict categorical variables efficiently and in a flexible way. In this paper, we apply this approach to the Ooypolder data set for the prediction of the water table classes from a sample data set. BME is compared with IK using global {{as well as local}} criteria. The inconsistencies of the IK predictor are emphasized and it is shown how BME permits avoiding them...|$|E

40|$|The {{accompanying}} table gives our {{evaluation of}} the present status of the Ξ resonances. Not much is known about Ξ reso-nances. This is because (1) they can only be produced {{as a part of}} a final state, and so the analysis is more complicated than if direct formation were possible, (2) the production cross sections are small (typically a few µb), and (3) the final states are topologically complicated and difficult to study with electronic techniques. Thus early information about Ξ resonances came entirely from bubble chamber experiments, where the numbers of events are small, and only in the 1980 ’s did electronic exper-iments make any significant contributions. However, nothing of significance on Ξ resonances has been added since our 1988 edition. For a detailed earlier review, see Meadows [1]. Table 1. The status of the Ξ resonances.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop the water management operational plan at tertiary blocks for the growthof rice and corn. Study was conducted at reclaimed tidal lowland area which was located at Primer 10, Delta Saleh. This area was classified as a C-typhology land (dry). The methods of the study were survey, field measurements, computer simulation, and field action research. Study stages were consisted of survey and monitoring, water status evaluation, water management scenarios design, model simulation, and model adaptation. Computer model of DRAINMOD had been used to estimate the water <b>table</b> <b>status</b> and to design water table control operation at tertiary blocks. Simulation results showed that the model worked properly which was indicated by root mean square error of 1. 45 cm, model efficiency of 0. 97, and correlation coefficient of 0. 84. Model adaptation for dry land condition (C-typhology) showed that the best scenario was land utilization pattern of rice-corn.

40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} environmental factors defining the niche of terrestrial fungi, and fungi preserved in ombrotrophic peat deposits have the potential to indicate past variations in surface wetness and vegetation composition. This study aimed to assess the potential of fungal microfossils for palaeoclimate reconstructions. The environmental preferences of fungi were evaluated by assessing the relationships among fungal types, the peat-forming vegetation, the occurrence of fire, and water <b>table</b> <b>status</b> in fossil and modern samples from two raised bogs in northern England and Denmark. The microfungi which showed consistent patterns among the three datasets examined in the study were generally indicators of relatively dry (hummock-like) conditions, and the abundance of most of the abundant fungal types observed reflected the prevalent vegetation type more than the direct influence of local moisture conditions. A number of fungal microfossils were identified which can be used to consistently provide a qualitative reconstruction of past conditions on the surface of the bog, and accurately indicate shifts between relatively dry and wet local conditions. Spores, in general, provided more information about local moisture conditions than vegetative mycelia. Some of the more abundant types, particularly Type 12 spores, showed a characteristic distribution with water table depth, which was consistent between the two different sites examined in the study. These fungal types can form the basis of future quantitative reconstructions of past water table and therefore climate in ombrotrophic bogs. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Shortage of {{precipitation}} in Kobo valley limits {{the production of}} vegetables during dry periods and the yield of cereals in the rainy periods. Irrigation from ground water could enable farmers to cultivate {{more than once a}} year. Since pumping has an effect on the ground water resources availability, effective management of water resources using reliable calculation of historical groundwater balances at local and sub-watershed scales is required (Kendy et al 2004). We used CropWat 4 Window to determine PET of the area and the Crop Water Requirement (CWR) of onion, tomato and pepper, which are cultivated using irrigation during dry months; T-M and simple water balance equations were used to quantify annual recharge to the water table and water <b>table</b> <b>status</b> under different irrigation scenarios. Although irrigation from the groundwater could ensure the food security of the area, different water management scenarios showed that the ground water table will be declining as a result. Recharge and water table calculations show that irrigation increases the recharge to the water table {{but at the same time}} reduces the overall water table depth due to pumping. Water table depth will not be depleted if irrigation follows the CWR of vegetables. Calculations for future water table levels indicate that, if the current irrigation rate is extended across all of the irrigable land in the area, the water table level will fall by 2 m per year. To protect against further water table decline, flashfloods should be captured and used to recharge to the ground water...|$|E

The <b>status</b> <b>table</b> contains {{a summary of the}} methods type and status for stack sampling and analysis of each of the 189 air toxics listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The table and its attachments have no direct regulatory standing, and therefore do not constitute approval of the use of the methods to satisfy regulatory requirements. Such approval must always be obtained from the regulatory agency or group involved in the individual project. Hopefully this compilation will aid both the regulator and the regulated community in making planning decisions for air toxics source testing. 2.
