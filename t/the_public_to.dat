40|$|We {{investigate}} the causal relationship between <b>the</b> <b>public</b> debt <b>to</b> GDP ratio {{and economic growth}} for 31 EU and OECD countries from 1995 to 2013. A {{number of studies have}} tackled this problem, but very few make the transmission mechanism explicit in their analysis. We estimate a panel VAR model that incorporates the long-term real interest rate on government bonds as a vehicle to transmit shocks in both <b>the</b> <b>public</b> debt <b>to</b> GDP ratio and economic growth. We find no causal link from <b>the</b> <b>public</b> debt <b>to</b> GDP ratio to the GDP growth rate, irrespective of <b>the</b> levels of <b>public</b> debt. Rather, we find a causal relation from the GDP growth rate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> debt <b>to</b> GDP ratio. In high-debt countries, the direct negative impact of economic growth on public debt is enhanced by a rise in the long-term real interest rate, which in turn decreases interest-sensitive demand and leads to a further increase in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> debt <b>to</b> GDP ratio...|$|R

5|$|Active {{resistance}} in Belgium {{took the form}} of sabotaging railways and lines of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced large numbers of illegal newspapers in both French and Dutch, distributed to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> provide news about the war not available in officially approved, censored newspapers. Some such publications achieved considerable success, such as La Libre Belgique, which reached a circulation of 70,000. Attacks on German soldiers were comparatively rare as the German administration made a practice of executing at least five Belgian hostages for each German soldier killed. At great personal risk, Belgian civilians also hid large numbers of Jews and political dissenters hunted by the Germans.|$|E
