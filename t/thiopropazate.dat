40|$|Using a blind {{evaluation}} of cinematographic films of patients suffering from tardive dyskinesia {{we found that}} <b>thiopropazate</b> hydrochloride in a dosage up to 30 mg daily was effective in reducing {{the severity of the}} dyskinesia in most patients. The overall improvement in the group of patients studied was not significant after one or three months of therapy but was significant after six months of treatment. The administration of <b>thiopropazate</b> hydrochloride over a six month period did not appear to aggravate the underlying pathophysiology so that the drug could be considered likely to be safe for long-term use.

40|$|A rapid {{sensitive}} {{method for}} {{the estimation of}} phenothiazine type drugsandtheir metabolites with an intact thiazine ring in biological fluids is presented. The method is basedon the calorimetric determination of the yellow nitration products of these compoundsformed after their alkaline ether extraction. RE OBJECT OF THIS STUDY {{was to investigate the}} possible use of nitration as the basis of a colorinietric method for the estimation of phenothiazine derivatives in biological fluids. If successful such an approach would provide a method applicable to all phenothiazine type drugs and their metabolites with an intact thiazine ring. During this investigation this approach provided a rapid, sensitive means of estimating the phenothiazine derivative concentration of urine and blood. The method is based on the colorimetric determination of the yellow nitration products of these compounds following their ether extraction from biologic fluids. The color formed is stable, and blank values for urine and serum are negligible. However, differences in recovery and color development between a drug and its metabolites complicate the precise estimation of concentration. Despite this dis-advantage the method may provide the clinician results of sufficient accuracy with a minimum of effort and special equipment. The derivatives included in this study were promazine and three of its known metabolites (monomethyl promazine, promazine sulfoxide, and monomethyl promazine suif oxide), promethazine, chlorproma-zine, <b>thiopropazate,</b> perphenazine, and prochlorperazine.
