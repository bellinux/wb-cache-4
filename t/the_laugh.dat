25|$|Unusual for the show, {{this episode}} filmed {{in front of}} a live studio audience, {{consisting}} of members of the Television Critics Association.

Writer Kourtney Kang described singer Carrie Underwood as a 'pleasant surprise' and worked to find additional jokes for her after she performed well in rehearsals.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} season of Sports Night is a sitcom, it often is portrayed {{as more of a}} comedy-drama {{representative}} of some of Sorkin's later work on The West Wing. Sorkin intended for the series' humor to be drier and more realistic than typical sitcoms. He initially wanted the show to be recorded without a laugh track, but ABC network executives insisted on including one. The volume of <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track faded as Season One continued and was abandoned at the beginning of Season Two.|$|E
25|$|Crosby had {{launched}} {{the tape recorder}} revolution in America. In his 1950 film Mr. Music, Crosby is seen singing {{into one of the}} new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of multitrack recording. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, also held various tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track that are still in use today.|$|E

This marked the first time the series was made available on an internet platform. As of July 1, 2015, all 11 seasons were available; syndicated versions of hour-long episodes were utilized for streaming, splitting these shows into two parts. In contrast to the DVD sets, the Netflix streams did not have an option for disabling <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track on the soundtrack. On April 1, 2016, M*A*S*H was removed from Netflix due to its contract to stream the series expiring.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, <b>The</b> <b>Laugh)</b> is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E

25|$|Chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans show laughter-like vocalizations in {{response}} to physical contact, such as wrestling, play-chasing, or tickling. This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Common chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognisable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting. Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human babies and bonobos when tickled. Although the bonobo's laugh was a higher frequency, <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> followed a pattern {{similar to that of}} human babies and included similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.|$|E
500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. <b>The</b> <b>laugh</b> track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track. Oftentimes [...] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] <b>The</b> <b>laugh</b> track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} has an {{extensive}} vocal range, with sounds ranging from whoops, fast whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, soft grunt-laughs, loud grunt-laughs, whines and soft squeals. The loud [...] "who-oop" [...] call, {{along with the}} maniacal laughter, {{are among the most}} recognisable sounds of Africa. Typically, very high-pitched calls indicate fear or submission, while loud, lower-pitched calls express aggression. The pitch of <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> indicates the hyena's age, while variations in the frequency of notes used when hyenas make noises convey information about the animal's social rank.|$|E

500|$|... "Roland" [...] {{contains}} the series' first mention of Fox Mulder's father Bill, although the character would not actually {{make an appearance}} until the second season episode [...] "Colony". In the original draft of the script for [...] "Roland", however, Mulder's mention of his father was instead meant to be his sister, Samantha. The scene depicting {{the aftermath of the}} Dr. Keats' murder—with the scattered pieces of his shattered frozen body marked off with multiple chalk outlines—has been described as [...] "truly inspired". Chris Carter noted that [...] "any shock and horror was eliminated by <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> you got when you saw those little pieces on the floor", also commenting that the actual murder takes place off-screen, and is only heard.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} the backing track in the car while he was going to the studio. He started playing with the Roland Jupiter 8 keyboard, while singer Simon Le Bon was working with the lyrics. The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Little Red Riding Hood, and the repeating of the word [...] "do" [...] {{at the end of each}} verse takes its melody from the instrumentals in Gordon Lightfoot's song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics. <b>The</b> <b>laugh</b> at the beginning of the song and the screams during the song's fade-out were performed and recorded live by Rhodes' girlfriend at the time.|$|E
500|$|Other {{causes for}} the {{incident}} were later suggested. Before committing the act, Brynn {{was taking the}} antidepressant drug Zoloft. A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in 1999 by Brynn's brother, Gregory Omdahl, against Pfizer, the drug's manufacturer, and her child's psychiatrist Arthur Sorosky, who provided samples of Zoloft to Brynn. Hartman's friend and former SNL colleague Jon Lovitz has accused Hartman's former NewsRadio co-star Andy Dick of re-introducing Brynn to cocaine, causing her to relapse and suffer a nervous breakdown. Dick claims to have known nothing of her condition. In 2006, Lovitz claimed that Dick had approached him at a restaurant and said, [...] "I put the Phil Hartman hex on you; you're the next one to die." [...] Lovitz responded by smashing Dick's face into the bar. [...] The following year at <b>the</b> <b>Laugh</b> Factory comedy club in Los Angeles, Lovitz and Dick had a further altercation over the issue. Dick asserts {{that he is not}} at fault in relation to Hartman's death.|$|E
