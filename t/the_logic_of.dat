5|$|Dalton applied <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> abolitionism to {{the cause}} of women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices {{and lead to}} an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also {{lead to an increase}} in poaching.|$|E

40|$|The {{figure of}} the drone is invoked as a {{contemporary}} avatar for <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> distributed networking at a distance, automated sense-making and automated response associated with interactive platforms more generally.

The argument focuses on examples of data mining in the affective frontier: apps that generate data about affective states in order to more effectively categorise and target users.

5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

40|$|Decidability and {{complexity}} of the satisfiability problem for <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> time intervals have been extensively studied in the last years. Even though most interval logics turn out to be undecidable, meaningful exceptions exist, such as <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> temporal neighborhood and (some <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subinterval relation. In this paper, we explore a different path to decidability: instead of restricting the set of modalities or imposing suitable semantic restrictions, we take the most expressive interval temporal logic studied so far, namely, Venema’s CDT, and we suitably limit the nesting degree of modalities. The decidability of the satisfiability problem for the resulting CDT fragment is proved by embedding it into a well-known decidable prefix quantifier class <b>of</b> first-order <b>logic,</b> namely, <b>the</b> Bernays-Schonfinkel’s class. In addition, we show that such a fragment is in fact NP-complete (the Bernays-Sch¨onfinkel’s class is NEXPTIME-complete), and that any natural extension of it is undecidable...|$|R
