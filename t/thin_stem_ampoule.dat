40|$|Intraspecific and {{interspecific}} architectural {{patterns were}} studied for eight tree species of a Bornean rain forest. Trees 5 [...] 19 m tall in two 4 -ha {{permanent sample plots}} in primary forest were selected, and three light descriptors and seven architectural traits for each tree were measured. Two general predictions were made: (1) Slow growing individuals (or short ones) encounter lower light, and have flatter crowns, fewer leaf layers, and <b>thinner</b> <b>stems,</b> than do fast growing individuals (or tall ones). (2) Species with higher shade-tolerance receive less light and have flatter crowns, fewer leaf layers, and <b>thinner</b> <b>stems,</b> than do species with lower shade-tolerance. Shade-tolerance is assumed to decrease with maximum growth rate, mortality rate, and adult stature of a species...|$|R
50|$|Galium trifidum is a usually {{perennial}} herb forming tangles of <b>thin</b> <b>stems</b> {{up to half}} a meter long, {{ringed with}} whorls of several linear to oval leaves. The inflorescence is a cluster of small white or pinkish flowers, each with usually three petal-like lobes in its corolla.|$|R
50|$|Leaves wavy edged, {{lanceolate}} in shape. 15 cm long on <b>thin</b> <b>stems.</b> Flowering {{occurs in}} spring; being white, reddish or lilac in colour. Fruit {{is a red}} berry. Suited to gardens with moist soils in semi shade to full shade. It is not frost tolerant. A bird attracting plant.|$|R
50|$|Hypochaeris glabra is {{an annual}} herb growing a small taproot, a basal rosette of leaves, {{and one or}} more <b>thin</b> <b>stems</b> 10 to 40 centimeters (4-16 inches) tall. The leaves are 2 to 10 centimeters (0.8-4.0 inches) long, smooth along the edges or with small lobes, and green in color, {{sometimes}} with a purplish tint near the veins. Atop the <b>thin,</b> naked <b>stems</b> are flower heads with small overlapping purple-tipped phyllaries and bright yellow ray florets. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a white pappus almost a centimeter (0.4 inches) long.|$|R
50|$|Some {{experts think}} that the eggs of a winged insect of the genus Chrysopa in the Chrysopidae family named lacewings, are {{considered}} to be Udumbara flowers. Larvae of lacewings are called aphid lions. When laying eggs, the female secretes a glue and lifts its abdomen up to form a thin stalk. White eggs are laid on this <b>thin</b> <b>stem</b> to keep larvae from eating meat after hatching. The type of flower that is considered Udumbara is about {{the same size as the}} lacewing egg and also on a <b>thin</b> <b>stem.</b> In Vietnam, this exotic species is considered by some scientists to be a fungus, that can not be ascertained because of its strange appearance. However, there is no basis to consider this strange creature as the Udumbara because it is contrary to the Buddhist scriptures.|$|R
50|$|The {{plants are}} monoecious, with {{male and female}} flowers on the same plant. Male flowers have long, <b>thin</b> <b>stems</b> that extend upwards from the vine. Female flowers are shorter, with a small round growth {{underneath}} the petals. This round growth turns into the squash if the flower is successfully pollinated.|$|R
