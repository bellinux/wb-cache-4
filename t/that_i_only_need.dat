6000|$|When I {{have said}} this I think I have done Malden justice, and said all of it that {{there is to be}} said, unless I should run into the old story of its antiquity, and tell you it was a Roman colony in the time of Vespasian, and that it was called Camolodunum. How the Britons, under Queen Boadicea, in revenge for the Romans' ill-usage of her--for indeed they used her majesty ill--they {{stripped}} her naked and whipped her publicly through their streets for some affront she had given them. I say how for this she raised the Britons round the country, overpowered, and cut in pieces the Tenth Legion, killed above eighty thousand Romans, and destroyed the colony; but was afterwards overthrown in a great battle, and sixty thousand Britons slain. I say, unless I should enter into this story, I have nothing more to say of Malden, and, as for that story, it is so fully related by Mr. Camden in his history of the Romans in Britain {{at the beginning of his}} [...] "Britannia," [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>only</b> refer the reader to it, and go on with my journey.|$|R

40|$|Groth 2 ̆ 7 s {{preliminary}} {{note on the}} 2 ̆ 2 golden mean 2 ̆ 2 in {{the inheritance}} of sizes in SCIENCE of April 17, 1914, pp. 581 - 584, deserves the attention of geneticists. Its publication is of such recent date <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>only</b> call attention {{to one or two}} points that seem to me of particular moment. In brief, Groth 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis is that the mode of inheritance in Fl not only of surfaces and volumes, but also of linear dimensions is to be expressed by √ab rather than by a + b / 2 where a and b are parent sizes. The hypothesis is based upon measurements {{of a large number of}} tomato fruits of parental and Fl plants. It will certainly be worth determining whether Groth 2 ̆ 7 s expression fits size characters in other plants. A hurried examination of data, both published and unpublished, derived from my own studies of seed size in beans and maize, indicates that Fl sizes are nearer the average than the geometric mean of the parent sizes. But my object now is not to lay stress upon any possible agreement or disagreement between my results and those of Groth. It is rather with the relation of Groth 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis to the idea of multiple factors <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am here concerned...|$|R
60|$|The Human ovum {{is about}} 1/125 {{of an inch}} in diameter, and might be {{described}} in the same terms {{as that of the}} Dog, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>only</b> refer to the figure illustrative (14 A) of its structure. It leaves the organ in which it is formed in a similar fashion and enters the organic chamber prepared for its reception in the same way, the conditions of its development being in all respects the same. It has not yet been possible (and only by some rare chance can it ever be possible) to study the human ovum in so early a developmental stage as that of yelk division, but {{there is every reason to}} conclude that the changes it undergoes are identical with those exhibited by the ova of other vertebrated animals; for the formative materials of which the rudimentary human body is composed, in the earliest conditions in which it has been observed, are the same as those of other animals. Some of these earliest stages are figured below, and, as will be seen, they are strictly comparable to the very early states of the Dog; the marvellous correspondence between the two which is kept up, even for some time, as development advances, becoming apparent by the simple comparison of the figures with those on page 249.|$|R
30|$|In {{the absence}} of sensor mobility, {{there has been a}} plethora of {{approaches}} for tracking multiple targets while associating targets with sensor measurements. Existing works [5 – 8] associate measurements acquired at static sensors with targets across time and rely heavily on probability models. A distributed Kalman filtering scheme is proposed in [9] relying on information diffusion strategies. In [9], only neighboring sensors collaborate, though all sensors in the network are utilized to track a single source while sensors have fixed locations. A different approach is followed in [10], where consensus-averaging is employed across the whole sensor network and all the sensors are forced to be active irrespective of the quality of their measurements. In [11], a related single-target distributed tracking approach is proposed, in which extended Kalman filtering is employed for tracking. A probability model is assumed to determine informative sensors which may lead to instability due to its dependence on the tracking estimates. Different in this paper, distributed tracking of multiple targets will be considered, while sensor mobility will be exploited and combined with a sensor-to-target association scheme for selecting target-informative sensors without the need of relying on model parameters and state estimators that maybe inaccurate and result divergence. It {{should be pointed out that}} the distributed characterization here is referring to the fact <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> <b>only</b> neighboring sensors <b>need</b> to communicate with each other and collaborate for multi-target tracking, while (ii) processing will take place in a few head sensors and will not involve all sensors in the network but only those sensors that bear information about the moving targets.|$|R
40|$|So what is Splunk? Instead {{of giving}} the {{technical}} details, which you can find online, I'll {{tell you what it}} did for me. Splunk slapped everything into one place, with one uniform format, and gave me the ability to forget about all these annoying details of where it is, how to parse it, and all <b>that.</b> Instead, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to interact with Splunk to find the data I need. This sounds simple and obvious, but it's surprising what you can do once you all of your data is indexed in one place. By having your data organized, querying becomes much easier. Let's say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to search telemetry for a sensor_name gtemp_ 1 h and to return all data that is at most five minutes old. And because Splunk can hook into a real]time stream, this data will always be up-to-date. Extending the previous example, I can now aggregate all types of data into one view based in time. In this picture, I've got transaction logs, telemetry, and downlinked files all in one page, organized by time. Even though the raw data looks completely than this, I've defined interfaces that transform it into this uniform format. This gives me a more complete picture for the question what was the spacecraft doing at this particular time? And because querying data is simple, I can start with a big block of data and whiddle it down to what I need, rather than hunting around for the individual pieces of data <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need. When we have all the data we need, we can begin widdling down the data with Splunk's Unix-like search syntax. These three examples highlights my trial-and-error attempts to find large temperature changes. I begin by showing the first 5 temperatures, only to find that they're sorted chronologically, rather than from highest temperatures to lowest temperatures. The next line shows sorting temperatures by their values, but <b>I</b> find <b>that</b> that fs not really what I want either. I want to know the delta temperatures between readings. Looking through Splunk's user manual, I find the delta function, which lets me dynamically generate new information to use in my query. With that extra piece of information, I can now return only the telemetry readings where the temperature changed by at least 10. One other useful feature I'll mention is that all of these queries can be run through Splunk's API. So any scripting language you can think of can plug right in and make these queries. This gives us the ability to build a lot of new tools...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had seized}} his hand, and was {{wringing}} it vehemently in expression of my pleasure {{in what he}} had told me. In <b>that</b> first moment <b>I</b> felt nothing but pure joy and an immeasurable relief. I drew my breath, a very deep and full one, in a sudden, absolute freedom from anxieties which had been none the less real and constant because so often burlesqued. Afterward considerations presented themselves to alloy my rapture, but for <b>that</b> moment, as <b>I</b> say, it was nothing but rapture. There was no question in it of the lovers' fitness for each other, of their acceptability to their respective families, of their general conduct, or of their especial behaviour toward us. All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could realise {{was that it was}} a great escape for both of us, and a great triumph for me.

40|$|Art {{is like a}} person—organic, complex, and emotional. Art’s {{differences}} {{cannot be}} defined by intellectual labels that only loosely describe what a viewer sees or feels {{in a piece of}} art. Only the artist has a full understanding of how a piece came to be, from the inception to the fully finished product. Once it leaves the artist’s hands, all the labels and analysis may stretch its meaning far from its original intention. So here I am, trying to blur the lines between the labels—specifically between art and fashion. Where does the art end and the design begin? Do I need to plan from start to finish, or can I create through a series of spontaneous actions and unconscious decisions? Why is a person drawn to something, and how can I become part of the creation of that product? Part of my process with art is tossing aside any process. <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>only</b> time to create a product: given enough time, I will have something to show for it. I know what I want in the end: to define a brand that is uniquely me. Whether that involves creative license over an existing label, or creating my own, it does not matter. To manage <b>that,</b> however, <b>I</b> need to find my process; understanding fashion construction requires working with the materials over a long time. For the moment, let us define my art as fantastical and romantic—slightly altered and cropped versions of reality. My images are emotions and colors on canvas; they are nothing more, nothing less. Others may try to define them, force meaning upon them. For now, while they are in my hands, why define them...|$|R
