500|$|AIDS in the United States first struck {{gay men and}} IV {{drug users}} in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay {{community}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the last time everyone they knew was healthy, which was the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976, when sailors came {{from all over the}} world to New York. Some of them carried sexually transmitted diseases and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: [...] "Before" [...] in 1980, and [...] "After" [...] by 1985. [...] "Before", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease. [...] "After" [...] signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.|$|E
