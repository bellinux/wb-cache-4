5|$|Enchanted is a 2007 American musical fantasy {{romantic comedy}} film, {{produced}} by Walt Disney Pictures with New York Academy Barry Sonnenfeld and Josephson Entertainment. Written by Bill Kelly {{and directed by}} Kevin Lima, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City. Enchanted was the first Disney film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, instead of Buena Vista Pictures Distribution.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century.

The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E

However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly although it was licensed to many software OEMs for resale. It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it (note that Unix is a multi-user operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had gotten out of the Unix business, except for an interest in SCO.|$|E
5|$|Aries was {{released}} internationally on 22 June 1993, although pirated cassettes {{of the album}} were being sold for $1 in Mexico ten days before the official release. WEA Latina prepared 500,000 copies <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> on the release date, but after finding legitimate copies of the compact disc were already being sold on the pirate market, they discovered only 300,000 units stored in their warehouse. WEA Latina responded to the piracy by having a Mexican radio station play the whole album {{a few days before}} its release. In Mexico, the album was certified triple platinum; it has sold over one million copies in the country. In the US, it debuted and peaked at number two on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, second to Gloria Estefan's album Mi Tierra. Aries remained in this position until it was replaced by the Gipsy Kings's album Love and Liberté 20 weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Eline struck Mozambique, {{there was already}} {{incoming}} assistance from the international community, responding to the earlier flooding. Mozambique's president at the time, Joaquim Chissano, requested for additional aid after the storm struck, asking for $65 million for both reconstruction and emergency aid, and later increasing the request to $160 million. By the end of February 2000, various countries had pledged $13.5 million to Mozambique, well short of the required needs, but that rose to nearly $119 million by March 17. By March 4, 39.6 tons of various relief goods reached the country, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> from the towns of Bilene and Magul. The supplies nearly overwhelmed the small airport at Maputo, as lack of distribution caused food to decay in the sun.|$|E

The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August.

5|$|Guitarist Jeff Hanneman was {{surprised}} by Rubin's interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts Run DMC and LL Cool J. During a visit by Slagel to a European music convention, Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with. Following the agreement, Friedman brought the band members to Seattle for two days of publicity shots, possible record shots, and photos for a tour book; Rubin felt no good photos of the band had been taken before that point. One of the photos was used on the back cover of the band's 1988 release South of Heaven. The album became an American Recordings album after Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It {{was one of only}} two Def Jam titles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> by Geffen Records through Warner Bros.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, urgent requests {{for food and}} clean water were made by residents in the hardest hit areas. By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless. By October30, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1million and roughly 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD). By October25, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>distributed</b> throughout the country. Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E
