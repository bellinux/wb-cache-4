5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological <b>thinking.</b> <b>In</b> the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{pedagogy}} was fundamentally {{based on}} John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), {{the most influential}} pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain. Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> terms of developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> both science and philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired <b>thinking.</b> <b>In</b> infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{was born}} in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E

5|$|The five Scottish {{universities}} {{had been}} oriented to clerical and legal training, after {{the religious and}} political upheavals of the 17th century they recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to {{the sons of the}} nobility and gentry. It helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment <b>thinking.</b> <b>In</b> the mid 19th century, the historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as well as the upper class. It prepared students for non-commercial careers in government, the law, medicine, education, and the ministry and a smaller group for careers in science and engineering. Scottish universities would admit women from 1892.|$|E
5|$|The unit's leader, Geoffrey Barkas (1896–1979) {{served in}} the 1915 Gallipoli {{campaign}} {{and then in the}} later part of the Battle of the Somme in France, where he won a Military Cross. Between the wars, Barkas was a filmmaker, working as a writer, producer, and director. In 1937, Barkas joined Shell-Mex/BP under its publicity director Jack Beddington, who guided Barkas into military camouflage. In May 1940, he was rapidly drafted into the Royal Engineers by Beddington's brother Freddie, with a summary 10-day basic training course, followed by a camouflage course.

5|$|These {{utilitarian}} fortifications {{were armed}} with artillery, {{intended to be}} used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour. The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised {{by the use of}} circular bastions and multi-tiered defences, combined with many traditional medieval features. These designs contained serious military flaws, however, and the second period of construction until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> mainland Europe. The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown, overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers, who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency.|$|E

5|$|Fort Glanville Conservation Park {{is one of}} South Australia's most {{important}} heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register and the National Trust's classified list. It is considered significant, in national historical military terms, for its association with Jervois and Scratchley; both leading British defence experts who influenced Australian defence <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century. The fort was very well constructed with high quality materials; facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation. The fort is largely intact and in original condition and is, along with Bluff Battery in Hobart, the best preserved Jervois-Scratchley designed fort in Australia. It is the only Australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament, and the only to have a regular living history program. Its companion Fort Largs does survive but in greatly modified condition, converted for use as the South Australia Police academy. The fort retains its original armament; armament that is both rare in Australia and worldwide.|$|E
5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing {{what is best for}} the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited <b>thinking,</b> <b>in</b> which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
