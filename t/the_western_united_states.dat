5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather very similar to <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in this regard.|$|E

5|$|The Bible Belt is an {{informal}} {{term for a}} region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is {{a significant part of}} the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average.

5|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation {{affects the}} {{precipitation}} distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Midwest, the Southeast, {{and throughout the}} tropics. There is also evidence {{that global warming is}} leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in the tropics and subtropics.|$|E

5|$|While most {{pesticide}} {{effects are}} likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the Sierra Nevada mountains of <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including Yosemite National Park in California.|$|E
5|$|During {{a tumultuous}} pioneer period {{characterized}} by its centrality in proximity to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> transportation in Omaha demanded {{the construction of}} massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with. Riverboats and stagecoaches jammed the riverside city {{with a variety of}} newcomers, prospectors and shady characters. Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore.|$|E
5|$|During his 1893 tour, Riley lectured {{mostly in}} <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> {{and in his}} 1894 tour in the east. His {{performances}} were major events, and generally sold out within days of their announcements. In 1894 he allowed author Douglass Sherley to join his tour. Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him to be accepted.|$|E

5|$|Hawaii did {{not allow}} {{same-sex}} marriages or civil unions, but two unmarried people can register for a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, which {{provides some of the}} rights and benefits that come with marriage. The bill was written to become law on January 1, 2010, would allow all couples to obtain rights equal to those of married couples, and make Hawaii the only state in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> to allow civil unions instead of domestic partnerships.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The High Cascades {{have long}} been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus and Protoceratops are {{the most}} common dinosaurs in the {{different}} Mongolian sediments where they are found. Triceratops fossils are far and away the most common dinosaur remains found in the latest Cretaceous rocks in <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> making up as much as 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna in some areas. These facts indicate that some ceratopsians were the dominant herbivores in their environments.|$|E
5|$|The Peace dollar {{circulated}} {{mainly in}} <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> where coins were preferred over paper money, and saw little circulation elsewhere.

With {{the last of the}} Pittman Act silver struck into coins in 1928, the Mint ceased production of Peace dollars.|$|E
25|$|Effectively, the PBoC sets {{different}} reserve {{levels for}} domestic and export styles of development.

5|$|The novelist Vladimir Nabokov {{was the son}} of a {{professional}} lepidopterist, and was interested in butterflies himself. He wrote his novel Lolita while travelling on his annual butterfly-collection trips in <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> He eventually became a leading lepidopterist. This is reflected in his fiction, where for example The Gift devotes two whole chapters (of five) to the tale of a father and son on a butterfly expedition.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{potential}} species assigned to the carnosaurian dinosaur genus Allosaurus since its description in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh, but only a handful are still regarded as valid.
