40|$|Tularemia is a {{debilitating}} febrile illness {{caused by the}} category A biodefense agent Francisella tularensis. This pathogen infects over 250 different hosts, has a low infectious dose, and causes high morbidity and mortality.

Through transposon mutagenesis of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica live vaccine strain (LVS), we identified FTL_ 0883 as a gene important for spermine responsiveness. In-frame deletion mutants of FTL_ 0883 and FTT_ 0615 c, the homologue of FTL_ 0883 in F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S 4 (Schu S 4), elicited higher levels of cytokines from human and murine macrophages compared to wild-type strains.

Although ~ 50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection, the early interactions of virulent Francisella with the lung environment are not well understood. To provide additional insights into these interactions during early Francisella infection of mice, we performed TEM analysis on mouse lungs infected with F. tularensis strains Schu S 4, LVS and the O-antigen mutant Schu S 4 waaY::TrgTn. For all three strains, the majority of the bacteria that we could detect were observed within alveolar type II epithelial cells at 16 hours post infection. Although there were no detectable differences in the amount of bacteria within an infected cell between the three strains, there was a significant increase in the amount of cellular debris observed in the air spaces of the lungs in <b>the</b> <b>Schu</b> S 4 waaY::TrgTn mutant compared to either <b>the</b> <b>Schu</b> S 4 or LVS strain. We also studied the interactions of Francisella strains with human AT-II cells in vitro by characterizing the ability of these three strains to invade and replicate within these cells. Gentamicin assay and confocal microscopy both confirmed that F. tularensis Schu S 4 replicated robustly within these cells while F. tularensis LVS displayed significantly lower levels of growth over 24 hours, although the strain was able to enter these cells at about the same level as Schu S 4 (1 organism per cell), as determined by confocal imaging. <b>The</b> <b>Schu</b> S 4 waaY::TrgTn mutant that we have previously described as attenuated for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence displayed interesting properties as well.

Furthermore, our data identified that human AT-II cells allow growth of Schu S 4, but these same cells supported poor growth of the attenuated LVS strain in vitro.

40|$|Francisella tularensis is a facultative {{intracellular}} bacterium utilizing macrophages as {{its primary}} intracellular habitat {{and is therefore}} highly capable of resisting the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), potent mediators of the bactericidal activity of macrophages. We investigated the roles of enzymes presumed to be important for protection against ROS. Four mutants of the highly virulent SCHU S 4 strain with deletions of the genes encoding catalase (katG), glutathione peroxidase (gpx), a DyP-type peroxidase (FTT 0086), or double deletion of FTT 0086 and katG showed much increased susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and slightly increased susceptibility to paraquat but not to peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and displayed intact intramacrophage replication. Nevertheless, mice infected with the double deletion mutant showed significantly longer survival than SCHU S 4 -infected mice. Unlike the aforementioned mutants, deletion of the gene coding for alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (ahpC) generated a mutant much more susceptible to paraquat and ONOO- but not to H 2 O 2. It showed intact replication in J 774 cells but impaired replication in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in internal organs of mice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Francisella tularensis causes tularaemia, a {{life-threatening}} zoonosis, and has {{potential as a}} biowarfare agent. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, which causes the most severe form of tularaemia, is usually confined to North America. However, a handful of isolates from this subspecies was obtained in the 1980 s from ticks and mites from Slovakia and Austria. Our aim was to uncover the origins of these enigmatic European isolates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined the complete genome sequence of FSC 198, a European isolate of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and compared it {{to that of the}} North American laboratory strain Schu S 4. Apparent differences between the two genomes were resolved by re-sequencing discrepant loci in both strains. We found that the genome of FSC 198 is almost identical to that of Schu S 4, with only eight SNPs and three VNTR differences between the two sequences. Sequencing of these loci in two other European isolates of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis confirmed that all three European isolates are also closely related to, but distinct from Schu S 4. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The data presented here suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Schu</b> S 4 laboratory strain is the most likely source of the European isolates of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis and indicate that anthropogenic activities, such as movement of strains or animal vectors, account for the presence of these isolates in Europe. Given the highly pathogenic nature of this subspecies, the possibility that it has become established wild in the heartland of Europe carries significant public health implications...|$|E
40|$|Background: Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative {{coccobacillus}} {{that causes}} the febrile illness tularemia. Subspecies that are pathogenic for humans include those comprising the type A (subspecies tularensis) or type B (subspecies holarctica) biovars. An attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS) developed from a type B isolate has previously been used to vaccinate at-risk individuals, but offers limited protection against high dose (. 1000 CFUs) challenge with type A strains delivered by the respiratory route. Due to differences between type A and type B F. tularensis strains at the genetic level, it has been speculated that utilization of an attenuated type A strain as a live vaccine might offer better protection against homologous respiratory challenge compared with LVS. Here, we report the construction and characterization of an unmarked DpurMCD mutant in the highly virulent type A strain Schu S 4. Methodology/Principal Findings: Growth of Schu S 4 DpurMCD was severely attenuated in primary human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and in the A 549 human lung epithelial cell line. <b>The</b> <b>Schu</b> S 4 DpurMCD mutant was also highly attenuated in mice when delivered via either the intranasal or intradermal infection route. Mice vaccinated intranasally with Schu S 4 DpurMCD were well protected against high dose intradermal challenge with virulent type A or type B strains of F. tularensis. However, intranasal vaccination with Schu S 4 DpurMCD induced tissue damage in the lungs, and conferred only limited protection against high dose Schu S 4 challenge delivered by the same route. The level o...|$|E
40|$|Francisella tularensis is a {{zoonotic}} bacterium that must exist in diverse environments ranging from arthropod vectors to mammalian hosts. To {{better understand how}} genes are regulated in these different environments, a transcriptional response- regulator gene (genome locus FTL 0552) was deleted in F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS). The FTL 0552 deletion mutant exhibited slightly reduced rates of extracellular growth {{but was unable to}} replicate or survive in mouse macrophages and was avirulent in the mouse model using either BALB/c or C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Mice infected with the FTL 0552 mutant produced reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, exhibited reduced histopathology and cleared the bacteria quicker than mice infected with LVS. Mice that survived infection with the FTL 0552 mutant were afforded partial protection when challenged with a lethal dose of <b>the</b> virulent <b>Schu</b> S 4 strain (4 of 10 survivors, day 21 post infection) when compared to naÃ¯ve mice (0 of 10 survivors by day 7 post infection). Microarray experiments indicate that 148 genes are regulated in the FTL 0552 mutant. Most of the genes are down regulated, indicating that FTL 0552 controls transcription of genes in a positive manner. The list of down regulated genes includes genes located within the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI) that are essential for intracellular survival and virulence of Francisella tularensis. Furthermore, a mutant in FTL 0552 or the comparable locus in Schu S 4 (FTT 1557 c) may be an alternative candidate vaccine for tularemia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Explicit {{combinatorial}} cancellation-free {{rules are}} {{given for the}} product of an equivariant line bundle class with a Schubert class in the torus-equivariant K-theory of a Kac-Moody flag man-ifold. The weight of the line bundle may be dominant or antidominant, and the coefficients may be described either by Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths or by the λ-chain model of the first author and Post-nikov. For Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths, our formulas are the Kac-Moody generalizations of results of Griffeth and Ram and Pittie and Ram for finite dimensional flag manifolds. A gap in the proofs of the mentioned results is addressed. 1. Introduction. 1. 1. Chevalley formulas.

40|$|Francisella tularensis is {{a highly}} infective, {{intracellular}} bacterium. It is capable of infecting {{a wide range of}} mammals and causes the disease tularemia in humans. As a result of its high infectivity {{there have been a lot}} of efforts made to create a generally available vaccine against this pathogen. One potential vaccine candidate is the FSC 043 strain, a spontaneous mutant that has acquired mutations making it attenuated for replication both in vitro and in the experimental mouse model. However, it was noted that it afforded protection against challenge with a highly virulent F. tularensis strain. The aim of this thesis has been to delineate the mechanisms of its attenuation to better understand F. tularensis pathogenesis and to obtain a better knowledge about the prerequisites of protective immunity against this potent pathogen. Microarray and whole-genome sequencing revealed four mutations in the attenuated FSC 043 strain that were not present in <b>the</b> virulent <b>SCHU</b> S 4 isolate. One of these mutations has been described earlier as it results in a fusion protein also found in other attenuated strains. Among the other differences, two mutations were identical nonsense mutations in a duplicated gene region known as the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI). The affected gene, pdpC, is coding for PdpC (pathogenicity determinant protein C). We found that these mutations resulted in a truncated form of PdpC, and also that the downstream gene was severely downregulated due to these mutations. Further, our studies revealed that the intracellular phenotype of the FSC 043 strain differed from other tested strains in that a small portion of the intracellular bacteria were able to escape the phagosome and multiply within the host, while the majority of intracellular bacteria stayed confined to the phagosome. We wanted to study the specific function of pdpC and therefore deleted both copies of it in <b>the</b> virulent <b>SCHU</b> S 4 strain as well as the Live Vaccine Strain, an empirically attenuated strain often used as a model for the virulent strains of F. tularensis. The resulting mutants showed an attenuated phenotype; no intracellular growth in murine cells, and no virulence in mice. When studying the intracellular localization of the LVS Δpdpc mutant, we found that it was uniformly located adjacent to phagosomal membrane-like structures but that the membrane was markedly disrupted. Further, this mutant induced an MOI-dependent cytotoxicity, measured by LDH release, and also the release of IL- 1 β, an inflammatory cytokine not induced by phagosomally contained mutants. Studies on markers for host cell death revealed that the LVS ΔpdpC mutant induced mitochondrial instability, phosphatidylserine (PS) presentation, and TUNEL-specific DNA fragmentation in infected cells, rather similar to the wild-type strain, despite its lack of replication. This study reveals that the pdpC gene is an important gene required for F. tularensis virulence. We also show that non-replicating intracellular bacteria can induce host cell death, hypothesizing that release of bacterial components in the host cell cytosol is required for this induction. The FSC 043 mutant showed a unique phenotype where a small subset of bacteria was able to escape the phagosome and replicate in the host cell. This was also seen in the pdpC deletion mutant of SCHU S 4, but not with the LVS ΔpdpC. However, regardless of genetic background, the ΔpdpC mutant had an effect on phagosomal escape; either by affecting the phagosomal membranes in a unique way or by allowing phagosomal escape of a small proportion of the bacteria...|$|R
