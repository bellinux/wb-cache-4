50|$|The flight {{hardware}} unit, the FOEP, was a pressure-tight canister {{containing a}} water-filled centrifuge {{that housed the}} two frogs. The centrifuge was a cylindrical structure that rotated the frogs' heads at scheduled intervals. The FOEP also contained a life support system which could maintain a regulated environment for the frogs. This system consisted of two closed loops, one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The interface between the two loops was a selectively permeable silicone rubber that acted as an artificial lung. Oxygen passed through the membrane from the gas to the liquid side, and carbon dioxide from the liquid to the gas side. The frogs were immersed in the liquid loop. A pump circulated oxygen through the gas-containing loop. Carbon dioxide entering the gas loop was removed by an absorbent and the purified oxygen returned to the pump for recirculation. A water evaporator and an electric heater maintained the water temperature at about 60 °F (15 °C). An amplifier system in the FOEP increased voltage output from the microelectrodes implanted in the animals to the level required by the <b>telemetry</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E

Patterns of {{alterations}} in fetal heart rate provide the earliest clue of jeopardy {{of the fetus}} from umbilical cord compression, abnormal uterine contractions, placental dysfunction or impaired fetal reserve. Correlated with uterine contractions, such patterns provide an index of {{the condition of the}} fetus and an objective basis for clinical management. The recognition of the value of continuous monitoring of these parameters has resulted in widespread use of electronic <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Telemetry</b> techniques have proved value as an alternative method of surveillance. A system has been devised for telemetry of fetal cardiac activity detected with ultrasound...|$|R
