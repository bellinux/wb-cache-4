40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} emotional intelligence {{and academic achievement}} of students at <b>the</b> higher <b>secondary</b> <b>level.</b> Using random sampling technique 321 students, from <b>the</b> higher <b>secondary</b> <b>level</b> in different systems of education, namely, state, matriculation and central board schools are chosen. The Emotional Intelligence Scale (Hydes and others, 2002) {{has been used to}} assess the emotional intelligence and the marks scored in Science were taken from their half yearly performance. The data collected is subjected to statistical analysis, namely, mean, standard deviation, ‘t’- test, ‘F’- ratio, Karl Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Co-efficient ‘r’. Results show a positive significant correlation between emotional intelligence and academic achievement among the students. Further the students belonging to the central board schools have a higher level of emotional intelligence compared to students in state board but did not differ with students in matriculation board schools at <b>the</b> higher <b>secondary</b> <b>level.</b> Similarly, students belonging to central board schools are found to perform better in academics compared to students in state and matriculation board schools at <b>the</b> higher <b>secondary</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R
