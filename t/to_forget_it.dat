25|$|The plot {{follows a}} {{non-sequential}} structure; it switches from past memories to present experiences, and often entangles the two. This meshing of memory with sensation creates confusion {{between past and}} present, in which no details are concrete. Words and phrases are repeated throughout the book, highlighting themes and recurring ideas. This redundancy generates a sense of obsession throughout the narrative, Erika's obsession to learn the truth, and Hilde's obsession <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it.</b> Coupled with repetition, Reichart's use of recurring words—such as alone, exclusion, and guilt—emphasize their importance to the main points and the extreme feelings Hilde feels about them.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it</b> wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

The story, upon which this poem is founded, {{is one of the most}} interesting in the history of France, and is, in several respects, happily adapted to epic representation." [...] The review concluded: [...] "The general result of the impression which the perusal of this poem has made upon our minds is this: that, although the poem has some redundancies, which the chastised taste of maturer years would have struck out; though a manifest incongruity runs through the piece, in ascribing to characters of the fifteenth century the politics and metaphysics of an enlightened philosopher of the eighteenth; and though allegorical personages [...] but ill supply the place of that grand machinery [...] which have obtained the glorious meed of immortality; we, nevertheless, admire, the noble spirit of freedom, which is evidently the poet's inspiring muse".|$|E

2500|$|Just before Thanksgiving 1983, {{complications}} from {{a blood clot}} forced her to have her leg amputated. When {{she returned to the}} show in April 1984, her character's life mirrored her own. [...] After visiting Aunt Meta in New York, Bert returned to Springfield and began experiencing pain in her leg (which had been fitted with a prosthesis by this time and mostly kept off camera). [...] She ended up having her leg amputated just as the actress who played her had. For the first time in decades, Bert had to depend upon others to wait on her hand and foot, resulting in one of the series' most memorable stories. (Bert, sitting in a wheelchair at Cedars Hospital, told Josh Lewis, who had been paralyzed recently and had given up hope, that life itself was a miracle and never <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it.)</b> In a moving scene, Bauer dropped a teacup. She tried to get it, but could not, and in sheer frustration, she burst into tears. [...] As she went through rehab following her operation, camera shot closed in on her remaining leg as she learned to walk again, bringing even more realism to the storyline.|$|E
2500|$|Educated at Downlands College, in Toowoomba {{in southeastern}} Queensland, Veivers {{attended}} the University of Queensland, whom he represented in club cricket. He was made {{the captain of}} the Queensland Colts and scored 126 against the New South Wales Colts in 1958/59. He made his first-class debut in same season against the touring English cricket team and made his Sheffield Shield that season also. He played as a middle order batsman and off-spinner, but did not command a regular spot in the Sheffield Shield team until the following season. He was selected for his first Australian squad in 1962, playing in an Australian XI against the visiting English team, in which he was hit for two sixes by Ted Dexter in his opening over. John Woodcock [...] of The Times wrote [...] "I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it.</b> Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards." [...] He was then selected for the Test team the following season to make his debut against South Africa in the First Test in Brisbane, in which he scored 14 batting at No. 8 and took 1/48. He was omitted for the third and fourth Tests, but managed to defy the South Africans with stubborn batting in the fifth Test in Sydney, salvaging a draw. He toured England in 1964, playing all Tests and scoring two half centuries and three three-wicket hauls. He followed this with two more half centuries and a career best of 4/68 on the tour to India.|$|E
2500|$|In olden {{days the}} twin poles of Australian cricket - Melbourne and Sydney - each hosted two Tests in a season, {{but now that}} Brisbane {{received}} a Test they took it in turns to host the extra Test and the Australian XI game. The selectors chose Test hopefuls under the Australian vice-captain Neil Harvey; Grahame Thomas, Bobby Simpson, Barry Shepherd, Ian McLachlan, Frank Misson, Bob Cowper, Tom Veivers, Johnny Martin, [...] Barry Jarman, Colin Guest and 12th man Jack Potter. Harvey must have had bitter memories of the match four years before which cost him the Australian captaincy; Peter May made 140 and 114, Laker and Lock took 12 wickets and the MCC won by 345 runs. Ted Dexter won the toss and after the loss of Geoff Pullar at 35/1 Dexter marched out and thrashed 102 off 110 minutes, hitting 2 sixes and 13 fours, and {{the hands of the}} fielders were left bruised and burning. [...] "There was a drive off Vievers which sent the ball soaring over the sightboard". John Woodcock [...] of The Times wrote [...] "I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it.</b> Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards." [...] After his departure Colin Cowdrey began to caressed the ball through the covers for 88, Ken Barrington a highly efficient 122 not out, Fred Titmus 37 and Barry Knight hit the 57 not like a good all rounder and the MCC make 458/5 in a day. Dexter carried on the innings for most of the next day, seeing Barrington make his first first-class double century (219 not out) and Knight 108, adding 209 for the sixth-wicket. He finally declared 40 minutes for tea for 633/7, had he waited any longer tea would have been taken early, but lost the advantage due to rain. It was the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the highest by the MCC since Douglas Jardine and company racked up 634/9 against South Australia back in 1932-33. The best bowler was Bobby Simpson who took 3/153 and now made 130 in response, adding 72 for the first-wicket with Thomas (27), 100 for the second with Harvey (51) and 67 for the third with Shepherd (114). Shepherd and McLachlan (55) added another 115 for the fourth-wicket, but David Larter (3/80) took three quick wickets and the Australian XI fell from 415/5 to 451 all out on the fourth and final day. Dexter was 182 runs ahead and could have enforced the follow on, but decided to give his bowlers a rest and batted again, but not very well. Colin Guest took 3/22 in some compensence for his first innings hammering and Dexter declared on 68/5, leaving the Australians 160 minutes to make 251 runs to win. They reached 201/4 thanks mainly to 91 not out from Shepherd and 68 from McLachlan. Dexter had used negative field placings throughout the match, which rather killed the sporting declaration, and the game died on its feet.|$|E

2500|$|He made 481 runs (48.10), {{the most}} runs by an England captain in Australia, and this remains a record. The team manager was [...] His Grace Bernard Marmaduke Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, GCVO, PC, Earl Marshal and Chief Butler of England, {{and it was}} joked that [...] "Lord Ted" [...] could only be {{controlled}} by a duke. In fact, the Duke was the President of Sussex County Cricket Club, had been instrumental in Dexter's appointment as county captain, shared his interests in horse racing and golf and was very popular with the Australian public. In the tour match between the MCC and an Australian XI Dexter hit 102 in 110 minutes, including 2 sixes and 13 fours. John Woodcock [...] of The Times wrote [...] "I doubt if {{it is possible to}} hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it.</b> Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards." [...] At the Adelaide Oval Dexter included [...] "a six from a gigantic hit onto the roof of the stand – one of the biggest hits ever seen at the ground." [...] He was the main draw in the England team and over a million spectators came to see the tourists, the most since 1936–37. The tour returned a record profit for the MCC of £24,000, beating the £17,000 of 1946–47. Dexter continued his good run of form to equal Patsy Hendren's England record of six consecutive Test 50s (85 and 172 against Pakistan and 70, 99, 93 and 52 against Australia), which he soon shared with Ken Barrington and more recently Alastair Cook. His powerful innings enlivened the First and Second Tests and gave England a 1–0 lead in the series. Australia came back to win the Third Test at Sydney, where Dexter had preferred to keep his fast bowling attack from the Second Test even when Fred Trueman volunteered to stand down in favour of a second spinner to Fred Titmus. In the end the unsupported Titmus took 7/79 in the first innings and Australia won by 8 wickets, E.W. Swanton and others thought that if either David Allen or Ray Illingworth had been in the team England would have won the Ashes. Even so, the match might have been saved if Dexter had not conceded 27 runs off 26 balls so that the teams would not have to return the next day to finish the game. The last few overs were played in the rain and it rained for most of the fifth day, so England might have won the Ashes. Dexter's negative field placings and lack of urgency failed to regain the Ashes and the painful draws in the Fourth and Fifth Tests particularly spoilt the atmosphere, as Richie Benaud was determined to hold onto the Ashes and Dexter was content to draw a series in Australia. In mitigation {{it should be noted that}} the Adelaide pitch was flat as a pancake. The Sydney ground was so saturated in the days before the match that mowing was impossible before the start. The [...] "square" [...] was like one large bunker and the oufield like a meadow. Barely a ball reached the boundary. Benaud was an advocate of [...] "go ahead" [...] captaincy and Dexter for [...] "brighting up" [...] cricket and their reputations were unfairly tarnished.|$|E
