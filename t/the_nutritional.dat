40|$|Background: Absence of {{effective}} and efficient screening tool for assessment of nutritional status have lead to high incidence of malnutrition among hospitalized patients. Objective: To develope practical screening tool for assessing nutritional status of hospitalized patients. Method: A simple method of <b>nutritional</b> assessment, called <b>The</b> Simple <b>Nutritional</b> Assessment, was compared to albumin serum as the gold standard. This study involved 50 nurses and 50 hospitalized patients in Dr. Moewardi General Hospital, Surakarta. Result: There was significant concordance of nutritional status assessed by <b>the</b> Simple <b>Nutritional</b> Assessment and <b>the</b> level of albumin serum (k= 0, 92). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio of <b>the</b> Simple <b>Nutritional</b> Assessment compared to serum albumin were 92 %, 67 – 75 %, and 3. 8, respectively. Internal consistence of <b>the</b> Simple <b>Nutritional</b> ssessment is high (Alpha= 0. 80). Average time required for doing the assessment was only 5 minutes. Conclusion: <b>The</b> Simple <b>Nutritional</b> Assessment {{can be used for}} quick screening of nutritional status of hospitalized patients with high sensitivity and reliability...|$|R

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving <b>the</b> <b>nutritional</b> content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks.

During the 1940s he studied <b>the</b> <b>nutritional</b> value of hay and pasture for sheep, the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture.|$|E

As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E
5|$|Implementing {{the diet}} can present {{difficulties}} for caregivers {{and the patient}} due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals.

Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet (MAD) or the low-glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) diet, because they find the difficulties too great.|$|E

Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E

All studies were designed to analyze {{the impact of the}} program with respect to the previous food stamps program, focusing on changes in household nutrient availability, while the 1985 and 1993 studies also focused on changes in household food expenditures (the amount of money households spent on acquiring food).|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and <b>the</b> <b>nutritional</b> value of foods.

In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E

5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, <b>the</b> <b>nutritional</b> deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on <b>the</b> <b>nutritional</b> benefits of the practice.|$|E
