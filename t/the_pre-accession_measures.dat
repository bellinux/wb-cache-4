40|$|Are there {{indications}} of {{real exchange rate misalignment}} {{in the case}} of <b>the</b> five <b>pre-accession</b> countries? Will stable real exchange rates, required by two of the Maastricht criteria, be in line with economic fundamentals in the pre-EMU period in these countries? In order to address these questions, we employ the concept of the fundamental real exchange rate (FRER), taking into account the specific features of countries in the advanced stage of transition. The FRER model approximates the integration gain with the impact of foreign direct investment on trade and allows for larger current account deficits if external debt is below a safety limit. The model coefficients are calibrated according to our previous econometric work. Sensitivity tests are used to deal with uncertainty about the baseline assumptions. According to the FRERs, there were signs of overvaluation for all <b>the</b> <b>pre-accession</b> economies, with <b>the</b> exception of Slovenia, at the end of 2001. The second main finding relates to the feasibility of stable real exchange rates in the pre-EMU period. Stability of real exchange rates will not automatically be in line with economic fundamentals in the forthcoming period and, moreover, the FRERs do not move in one direction in all <b>the</b> <b>pre-accession</b> countries.

A lot of attention {{is given to the}} analysis of the agricultural situation and prospects in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Also the evolution {{and the future of the}} CAP itself is broadly presented. Since the agricultural accession of CECs to the CAP will have an impact not only on the situation in the agricultural sectors in these countries but also on their overall economic situation, therefore some fiscal consequences are discussed in the end. The CECs problems with agriculture concern mainly the lack of modernisation (know-how), efficiency, and structural changes. The EU also has problems with agriculture. It is too costly. due to the high level of protection and overproduction (connected with storage of the costly surpluses). and unequally developed (there are big differences in rural development among the Member Countries). The accession may, to some extent, solve CECs. and EU. s problems with agriculture, but under the condition, that the CECc will get ready to join the CAP structures, as much as it is possible. Therefore, generally, <b>the</b> <b>pre-accession</b> policies in <b>the</b> Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland should focus on investments in rural development and employment reductions since these policies guarantee improvement of agricultural productivity and improvement of agricultural to non-agricultural income ratio (which are the most desirable goals). It should be remembered, however, that the changes in agricultural sector need usually more time than the changes in other sectors so the agricultural accession of CECs to the CAP should come after the agricultural reorganisation. <b>The</b> <b>pre-accession</b> changes in agriculture will be co-financed by the EU. As far as budgetary effects are concerned, <b>the</b> <b>pre-accession</b> agricultural aid from the EU has little or no direct budgetary effects for the applicant countries.
