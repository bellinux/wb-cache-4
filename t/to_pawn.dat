5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, {{their desire to}} keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they are quick <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> her off onto the other parent when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo disintegrating, Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} {{placed the}} regency in considerable difficulties. In spite of Apokaukos' adroit {{management of the}} state's finances, the devastation caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress Anna was forced <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 ducats. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to a scarcity of food in Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the Pope, promising the submission of herself, John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.|$|E
5|$|From 1905–1907, Peng was {{enrolled}} in a traditional Confucian primary school. In 1908 Peng attended a modern primary school; but, at the age of ten, was forced to withdraw from this school due to his family's deteriorating financial situation. In 1905–1906, there was a severe drought in Hunan. Peng's mother died in 1905, and Peng's six-month-old brother died of hunger. Peng's father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food, and <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> most of his family's land. When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908, he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village. From 1908–1910, Peng took a job looking after a pair of water buffaloes.|$|E

25|$|Valuations {{almost always}} assign the value 1 point <b>to</b> <b>pawns</b> (typically {{as the average}} value of a pawn in the {{starting}} position). Computer programs often represent the values of pieces and positions in terms of 'centipawns' (cp), where 100 cp = 1 pawn, which allows strategic features of the position, worth less than a single <b>pawn,</b> <b>to</b> be evaluated without requiring fractions.|$|R

5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has {{the opportunity}} to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Tahsi is {{approached}} by a thief (Danielle Burgio), who has fled to Guam with a stolen rare jade dragon and wants <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> it, promising to return in 24 hours. Tahsi agrees, but does not promise not to sell it. Indeed, Jane Goody, who {{turns out to be}} a friend of his, visits his shop and buys the dragon, despite Tahsi's reluctance. She later has it appraised, learning it is worth many times more than she paid for it, heightening her hopes of paying the tuition for her sister's medical degree. Later, an enforcer (Arnold Chon) for the yakuza group Black Dragons, the original owners of the jade dragon, appears in Tahsi's shop with the thief in a headlock, demanding the figurine's return. Tahsi refuses to reveal Jane's identity and is killed along with the thief.|$|E

25|$|In December 1913, Bernhardt {{performed}} another {{success with}} the drama Jeanne Doré. On 16 March, she was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur. Despite her successes, she was still short of money.

25|$|In October 1800 {{there were}} food riots in Calton. In 1816 a soup kitchen was {{established}} in Calton {{which led to a}} riot that again had to be put down by troops. By the 1830s the Calton handloom weavers were among the most destitute of the skilled working class. Not just men but women and children worked the looms in their struggle to survive. During the frequent depressions of that period many were forced <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> their bedding and clothes to avoid starvation.|$|E

In July 2002, canoeists found Davis' body in Twinwood lake, another body {{of water in the}} same national park where Rachel's body was found.|$|E
25|$|Herrera {{turned over}} the office to General Mariano Arista on 15 January 1851 and retired to private life. Evidence of his honorable {{character}} {{is provided by the}} following account: the day he resigned the presidency, he was forced <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> a jewel to alleviate his economic situation. President Arista named him director of the Monte de Piedad (national pawnshop), a position which he held until 1853. He died on 10 February 1854 in his modest house in Tacubaya. He was buried without pomp in the cemetery of San Fernando.|$|E

He moved to London in April 1780, where he had little success, {{and by the end of}} May he had been forced <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> some of his possessions, {{including}} his surgical instruments. He composed a number of works but was refused publication. He wrote several letters seeking patronage, but these were also refused. In June Crabbe witnessed instances of mob violence during the Gordon Riots, and recorded them in his journal.|$|E

Briefly, she feels as though she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> his overcoat (Vecchia zimarra—"Old coat"). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together. Mimì tells Rodolfo that her love for him is her whole life (aria/duet, Mimì and Rodolfo: Sono andati?—"Have they gone?").|$|E
25|$|Suspects were {{consistently}} brought in {{throughout the day}} by city police. Many friends of the victims, schoolmates and others went to the Bowie County Sheriff's Office to lend information. Atkins and the other girls from Booker's band talked to Gonzaullas and Presley for a long time. Atkins suggested that Booker should have a saxophone with her and since no saxophone had been found, it became a very important lead. The make and serial number were obtained and widely circulated <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> shops and music dealers in many states, but her saxophone was not found until six months later. Suspects were continually questioned during the night, but by Monday morning, Gonzaullas said that although some progress had been made there were still many missing links.|$|E

He explains {{the source of his}} riches: a job with an eccentric English gentleman, who ordered him to play his violin to a parrot until it died. The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table to eat and drink. Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.|$|E

In it, he requested some of the property that was confiscated from him {{to be returned to}} his heirs, and wages still due to him for his years as Governor and President be paid and turned over to his heirs. With affection he bequeathed most of his belongings to a woman Sabina de Guzmán, who had taken care of him in his illness. He also bequeathed belongings to the Franciscan Order, in spite of the conflicts he had had with its members in New Spain. He probably died in Valladolid in 1558 on October 16 or shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In August 1343, while {{negotiations}} were continuing between Castile and Granada, news arrived that in Morocco King Abu al-Hasan Ali was preparing a fleet {{to come to}} the aid of the city. Faced with the imminent entry into the struggle of forces from Granada and Morocco, it became urgent for the Christians to accelerate plans for the conquest of Algeciras. Simultaneously, Alfonso de Castilla heard that the Pope would give the kingdom 20,000 florins to defray the expenses of the campaign, and the king of France through the Archbishop of Toledo, Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz, would supply 50,000 florins. With this money the Spaniards could pay the Genoese mercenaries, who had long being demanding their pay. The difficulties of the Christians in the siege and the urgency of battle with Granada and Morocco were known throughout the kingdom. The king of Castile had <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> his crown and send several of his silver belongings to be melted in Seville after a fire reduced the camp's store of flour to ashes.|$|E

Dickens, aged 12, was forced <b>to</b> <b>pawn</b> his collection of books, leave school and go to work at a shoe-blacking factory, a dirty and rat-infested place.
