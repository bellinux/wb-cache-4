5|$|Soon after Nell begins {{working at}} The Orchard, Rupert Brooke becomes a resident. As he enjoys his summer working on papers for Cambridge {{societies}} and composing his poetry, Brooke leads {{a social life}} flirting with various women and enjoying the company of artists and other students. Brooke soon lusts for Nell, and his increased interest in her leads to unconventional encounters. They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} insight further {{practice}} is necessary, to deepen the insight and learn <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> in daily life. In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, this further practice consists of further pondering {{of the same}} Hua Tou. In Rinzai-Zen, this further practice is undertaken by further koan-study, for which elaborate curriculae exist. In Soto-Zen, Shikantaza is the main practice for deepening insight.|$|E

25|$|The basic calculating {{system was}} so adapted that could he but obtain regular and {{reliable}} data, he could fix the currency relationships among many more countries. Mee believed, however, that even his incomplete data had great utility. The currency relationships permitted him {{to determine the}} purchasing power of the Stelo and <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> in the national currency of a certain country. To {{be able to put}} the Stelo into service everywhere would require the joint work of a multinational network of collaborators. Yet Lawrence Mee continued.|$|E
25|$|Pytheas {{took the}} {{altitude}} {{of the sun}} at Massalia at noon on the longest {{day of the year}} and found that the tangent was the proportion of 120 (the length of the gnōmōn) to 1/5 less than 42 (the length of the shadow). Hipparchus, relying on the authority of Pytheas (says Strabo), states that the ratio is the same as for Byzantium and that the two therefore are on the same parallel. Nansen and others prefer to give the cotangent 209/600, which is the inverse of the tangent, but the angle is greater than 45° and it is the tangent that Strabo states. His number system did not permit him <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> as a decimal but the tangent is about2.87.|$|E
25|$|Chinese and Japanese Zen is {{grounded}} on the Chinese {{understanding of the}} Buddha-nature as one true's essence, and the Two truths doctrine as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality. Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or Buddha-nature, thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality. In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and shikan-taza, sitting meditation, is {{the expression of the}} already existing Buddhahood. Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a break-through insight in this Buddha-nature, but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> in daily life, as expressed in the Three mysterious Gates, the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. The Japanese Zen-scholar D.T. Suzuki noted similarities between Zen-Buddhism and Christian mysticism, especially meister Eckhart.|$|E

25|$|He {{compiled}} an eight-volume Geographia covering {{what was}} known about the earth. The {{first part of the}} Geographia is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest, Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the Canary Islands.|$|E

500|$|The {{continued}} {{influx of}} foreign players at Arsenal has, however, attracted criticism. In a league match against Crystal Palace on 14 February 2005, Arsenal fielded a 16-man squad that featured no British players {{for the first}} time in the club's history. This prompted Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief executive Gordon Taylor <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> would begin [...] "a worrying pattern for English football". A year later, manager Alan Pardew commented that Arsenal's Champions League success was [...] "not necessarily a triumph for British football". Wenger saw the issue of nationality as irrelevant and said, [...] "When you represent a club, it's about values and qualities, not about passports". Other pundits including Trevor Brooking, the director of football development at the FA, have defended Wenger. Brooking has stated that a lack of English players in [...] "one of England's most successful clubs" [...] was more of a reflection on England's limited talent pool rather than on Wenger, an opinion shared by youth team coach and ex-Liverpool player Craig Johnston.|$|E
500|$|Mahavira {{taught the}} {{doctrine}} of [...] "many-sided reality". This doctrine {{is now known as}} Anekantavada or Anekantatva. This term does not appear in the earliest layer of Jain literature or the Jain Agamas, but the doctrine is illustrated in the answers of Mahavira to questions his followers asked. According to Mahavira, truth and reality are complex and always have multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> completely with language. Human attempts to communicate are Naya, or [...] "partial expressions of the truth". Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahavira, language returns and not the other way around. One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempt to express the experience is syāt, or valid [...] "in some respect" [...] but still remaining a [...] "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete". In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, with multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{will discuss}} the basis of two {{parallel}} approaches {{for the development of}} a distributed software components aggregation system. The first approach relates to building a system (DECADS) allowing concrete examples of components aggregations. The other approach is about a theoretical framework aiming to provide a mathemati-cally precise meaning for the particular domain of interest. The former will use multiple programming languages to construct the concrete aggregation tools. The latter will use category theory and topos theory <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it’s</b> concepts. Both approaches are aimed at the realization and understanding of the TELOS system of theme 6 in the LORNET project: a flexible framework for eLearning systems design and implementation. ...|$|R

After years of hunting together, the relationship between Jo and Ellen also develops; Tal came to view them more as equals rather than daughter and mother. Although Jo's feelings for Dean remain the same, Tal liked the fact that she does not easily give in to Dean's advances in [...] "Abandon All Hope...". She believed that Jo resists her urge to [...] "go crazy [...] " [...] due to the dire circumstances, which [...] "gave it a little more meaning". When asked about the kiss that Dean gives to Jo when she is dying, Tal explained that she interpreted the kiss as Dean [...] "really seeing [...] and thanking [...] and appreciating [...] For him, at that particular moment, {{there was no other way}} <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> but with a kiss." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>it</b> with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
