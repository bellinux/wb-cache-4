5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination for <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country</b> {{and their relationship}} to it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{migration}} peaked 1870-1900. By 1890, the U.S. census {{reported a}} Swedish-American population of nearly 800,000. Many {{of the immigrants}} became classic pioneers, clearing and cultivating the prairies of the Great Plains, while others remained in the cities, particularly Chicago. Single young women usually went straight from agricultural work in the Swedish countryside to jobs as housemaids. Many established Swedish Americans visited <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country</b> in the later 19th century, their narratives illustrating the difference in customs and manners. Some made the journey {{with the intention of}} spending their declining years in Sweden.|$|E

25|$|One {{major factor}} was the neighborhood's {{high quality of}} life. Like most {{immigrant}} communities at the time, Ybor City had everything a recent arrival could need: work, shops, schools, churches, and most importantly, other immigrants who shared the language and customs of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country.</b> But unlike most U.S. immigrant enclaves of the period, Ybor City was no slum.|$|E
25|$|Redclift (2003) {{concluded}} {{that many of}} the one million migrants, mainly of British and Irish origin, who arrived in Canada in the mid-19th century benefited from the availability of land and absence of social barriers to mobility. This enabled them to think and feel like citizens of the new country in a way denied them back in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1860, the Bard {{family had}} {{provided}} money {{so that a}} small Episcopal seminary near their Tivoli estate could be expanded into St. Stephen's College, later renamed after them. It eventually expanded into three of the former country seats. This {{was the beginning of}} a second life for some of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country</b> seats, as some moved out of private residential use and became institutions. The Catholic Church received Ellerslie, Ferncliff and Linwood, using them for various purposes. Dorothy Day made Rose Hill the location of one the Catholic Worker Movement's farms during the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the route}} was paved with concrete. The two roadways were {{separated}} by a median varying in width, often filled with trees. Most of the rows of trees along <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country</b> lane were incorporated into the median, and new ones were planted in the gaps, as equal focus was given to functionality as aesthetics. Over most of the bridges, the two roadways converged, undivided. These were, however, a great improvement from the bridges along the old lane, {{as seen in the}} picture at left. At Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) was Canada's first cloverleaf interchange, opened in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{was born}} on July 30, 1857, in Cato, Wisconsin, to Norwegian American {{immigrant}} parents, Thomas Veblen and Kari Bunde. He was the fourth of twelve children in the Veblen family. His parents emigrated from Norway to Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 16, 1847, with little funds and no knowledge of English. Despite their limited circumstances as immigrants, Thomas Veblen’s knowledge in carpentry and construction paired with his wife’s supportive perseverance allowed them to establish a family farm, which is now a National Historic Landmark, in Nerstrand, Minnesota. This farmstead and other similar settlements were referred to as little Norways, oriented by the religious and cultural traditions of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country.</b> The farmstead was also where Veblen {{spent most of his}} childhood.|$|E

25|$|In 1832 the Society {{suffered}} a serious division. Of 750 members, 250 became alienated through {{the influence of}} Bernhard Müller (self-styled Count de Leon), who, with 40 followers (also at variance with the authorities in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country),</b> had come to Economy to affiliate with the Society. Rapp and Leon could not agree; a separation and apportionment of the property were therefore agreed upon. This secession of one-third of the Society, which consisted mostly of the flower of young manhood and young womanhood {{who did not want}} to maintain the custom of celibacy, broke Frederick's heart. He died within two years. It resulted in a considerable fracturing of the community. Nevertheless, the Society remained prosperous in business investments for many more years to come.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the American Catholic parochial school system {{can be divided into}} three phases. During the first (1750–1870), parochial schools appeared as ad hoc efforts by parishes, and most Catholic children attended public schools. During the second period (1870–1910), the Catholic hierarchy made a basic commitment to a separate Catholic school system. These parochial schools, like the big-city parishes around them, tended to be ethnically homogeneous; a German child would not be sent to an Irish school, nor vice versa, nor a Lithuanian pupil to either. Instruction in the language of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country</b> was common. In the third period (1910–1945), Catholic education was modernized and modeled after the public school systems, and ethnicity was deemphasized in many areas. In cities with large Catholic populations (such as Chicago and Boston) there was a flow of teachers, administrators, and students from one system to the other.|$|E
25|$|The German Palatinates {{who settled}} in Pennsylvania, erroneously {{known as the}} Pennsylvania Dutch, also left their homelands {{for a number of}} reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country,</b> and {{economically}} they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.|$|E

500|$|Even as {{a colonial}} pioneer, Crease {{clung to the}} aristocratic traditions of Britain. The Crease family's home in New Westminster was Ince Cottage, on Sapperton Road, named for the castle that belonged to Henry's mother's family in England.

500|$|In Australia, the Duke {{opened the}} first session of the Australian Parliament upon the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth of Australia. In New Zealand, he praised the military values, bravery, loyalty, and obedience to duty of New Zealanders, and the tour gave New Zealand a chance to show off its progress, especially in its adoption of up-to-date British standards in communications and the processing industries. The implicit goal was to advertise New Zealand's attractiveness to tourists and potential immigrants, while avoiding news of growing social tensions, by focusing the attention of the British press on a land few knew about. On his return to Britain, in a speech at London's Guildhall, George warned of [...] "the impression which seemed to prevail among [...] brethren across the seas, that <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Country</b> must wake up if she intends to maintain her old position of pre-eminence in her colonial trade against foreign competitors." ...|$|E
500|$|Other forces {{worked to}} push the new {{immigrants}} towards the cities, particularly Chicago. According to historian H. Arnold Barton, the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped {{by more than half}} between 1865 and 1890, which led to progressively poorer Swedes contributing a growing share of immigration (but compare Brattne and Åkerman, see [...] "Crossing the Atlantic" [...] above). The new immigrants were increasingly younger and unmarried. With the shift from family to individual immigration came a faster and fuller Americanization, as young, single individuals with little money took whatever jobs they could get, often in cities. Large numbers even of those who had been farmers in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>country</b> made straight for American cities and towns, living and working there at least until they had saved enough capital to marry and buy farms of their own. A growing proportion stayed in urban centers, combining emigration with the flight from the countryside which was happening in the homeland and all across Europe.|$|E
