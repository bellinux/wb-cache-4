In an interview with The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine, Biller said that the only similarity between the original pitch and the final copy was that the episode deals with the character B'Elanna Torres being split into two parts.

500|$|Parsons and Parsons {{have shown}} that {{juvenile}} and sub-adult specimens of Deinonychus display some morphological differences with the adults. For instance, {{the arms of the}} younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults, a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults. Another example of <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> function of the pedal claws. Parsons and Parsons have suggested that the claw curvature (which Ostrom [...] had already shown was different between specimens) maybe was greater for juvenile Deinonychus, as this could help it climb in trees, and that the claws became straighter as the animal became older and started to live solely on the ground. This was based on the hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing. In a 2015 paper, they reported after further analysis of immature fossils that the open and mobile nature of the shoulder joint might have meant that young Deinonychus were capable of some form of flight.|$|E

[...] Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the [...] "angel", it could be of a [...] "preternatural order", making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant. Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as [...] "tori no hito" [...] or [...] "a bird's person" [...] which is the nickname of Nausicaä from his Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga and film.

500|$|There {{are several}} {{documented}} cases of people surviving under highway overpasses, but scientists and meteorologists warn against using them for protection. From scientific lessons learned, meteorologists insist that overpasses are insufficient shelter from tornado winds and debris, {{and may be}} [...] to be during a violent tornado. The embankment under an overpass {{is higher than the}} surrounding terrain, and the wind speed increases with height. Additionally, the overpass design may create a [...] "wind-tunnel" [...] effect under the span, further increasing the wind speed. Many overpasses are completely exposed underneath and most lack hanging girders or a crawlspace-like area to provide sufficient protection from debris, which can travel at high speeds even in weak tornadoes. ( [...] a highway underpass is close at hand, and [...] it has such deep crawlspaces behind sheltering girders, and [...] no better shelter is available in the face of imminent danger from a tornado, then <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best and most survivable option.

500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
