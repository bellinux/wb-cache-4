5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of <b>the</b> <b>rudder.</b> In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rudders</b> do {{not have}} to rotate upwards in low water, but slide upwards inside their cheek plates when a {{retaining}} line is pulled. The boat can still be steered when <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> are at <b>the</b> keel line, this allows sailing in areas with low water levels.|$|R
2500|$|... 2. The wash {{also created}} an eddy at <b>the</b> <b>rudders,</b> making it {{impossible}} to steer.|$|R
50|$|Seacoral also {{improved}} handling at idling speeds {{by adding}} 3in {{to the length}} of <b>the</b> <b>rudders.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and enlisted men. The Swiftsures were quite manoeuvrable {{as a result}} of their balanced rudder and a hull form optimized to make <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|E
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} aerodynamics of the radiators and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|A rudder and {{a section}} of {{propeller}} shaft were {{on display at the}} Arashiyama Art Museum until it closed around 1991. <b>The</b> <b>rudder,</b> an anchor and one propeller have been relocated to the JMSDF Kure Museum, directly {{across the street from the}} Yamato Museum. The left-side 410mm gun from No. 3 turret is displayed outside as well, in Daiwa Park, Kure. The current whereabouts of the propeller shaft is now unknown.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{aircraft}} was built of metal except for <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> which were fabric-covered metal frames.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThree twisted rudders fit {{for large}} {{container}} ships have been developed; 1) <b>the</b> Z-twisted <b>rudder</b> {{that is an}} asymmetry type taking into consideration incoming flow angles of the propeller slipstream, 2) <b>the</b> ZB-twisted <b>rudder</b> with a rudder bulb added onto <b>the</b> Z-twisted <b>rudder,</b> and 3) <b>the</b> ZB-F twisted <b>rudder</b> with a rudder fin attached to <b>the</b> ZB-twisted <b>rudder.</b> <b>The</b> twisted <b>rudders</b> have been designed computationally with the hydrodynamic characteristics in a self-propulsion condition in mind. The governing equation is the Navier-Stokes equations in an unsteady turbulent flow. The turbulence model applied is the Reynolds stress. The calculation {{was carried out in}} towing and self-propulsion conditions. The sliding mesh technique was employed to simulate the flow around the propeller. The speed performances of the ship with <b>the</b> twisted <b>rudders</b> were verified through model tests in a towing tank. The twisted versions showed greater performance driven by increased hull efficiency from less thrust deduction fraction and more effective wake fraction and decreased propeller rotating speed...|$|R
2500|$|On August 6, 2009, SNG sent {{a letter}} to GGYC, {{containing}} the measurement procedures for the yachts. [...] GGYC did not accept these procedures, in particular because the SNG procedure would include <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> in <b>the</b> LWLmeasurement and thus result in GGYC's boat BMW Oracle Racing 90 being disqualified. [...] GGYC requested the court to declare that the measurement procedure proposed by SNG was not valid (in particular <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> should not be included when measuring length on the load waterline). SNG maintained its position. [...] On October30, 2009, the court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> should not be included for the measurement of the Load Water Line Length (GGYC's position). SNG appealed that ruling, but the appeal was denied on December15, 2009.|$|R
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. <b>The</b> <b>rudder</b> hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> tail {{vertical}} <b>rudder</b> meter set {{a vertical}} gyrocompass to control <b>the</b> vertical tail <b>rudders.</b> <b>The</b> gyrocompass guided the torpedo to the target, allowing even rear-launched torpedoes {{to turn around}} and hit a target in front. <b>The</b> tail <b>rudders</b> and side stabilizers were operated by air pressure.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} more {{controlling}} air tanks of total capacity 40.5 liters containing air compressed to 230 atm, to operate <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> and stabilizers of the torpedo.|$|R
60|$|The biplane {{was already}} out of control. Sam {{manipulated}} <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> as best he could, and likewise the ailerons, and the machine dropped in several wild dashes.|$|R
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like <b>the</b> <b>rudder,</b> and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward section}} lies on its port side, with the {{amidships}} section keel up. The stern section {{rises from the}} seabed at an angle. This position shows <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' {{to bear on the}} German ships.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{steering}} was by a contrabalanced rudder (black, at {{left in the}} picture), {{with its}} associated steering gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>rudders</b> were shifted, and swiftly the biplane mounted through space. It was now growing dark, and {{presently}} {{the panorama}} {{that had been}} below them, vanished from view.|$|R
50|$|The Latécoère 550 had its {{tailplane}} {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage, strut braced from below and bearing twin inboard fins and rudders separately braced {{to the top of the}} fuselage. During flight trials, these vertical surfaces evolved in stages from a rather blunt shape, with extensions below the tailplane to a surface with a smoothly curved trailing edge entirely above <b>the</b> tailplane. <b>The</b> <b>rudders</b> were fitted with trim tabs. Because of <b>the</b> inboard <b>rudders,</b> <b>the</b> elevators had three sections.|$|R
500|$|Greeneville {{suffered}} {{some damage}} in the collision. [...] Beginning at the [...] mark on <b>the</b> submarine's <b>rudder,</b> surface tiles had been sheared off, exposing bare metal, and there were several dents on <b>the</b> <b>rudder's</b> leading edge, one of which had punctured the metal skin. [...] A [...] section of acoustic hull surface treatment tiles below the sail had been sheared off as well.|$|R
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck <b>the</b> <b>rudder,</b> taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign <b>the</b> <b>rudder,</b> which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wheel in}} the two-seat cabin {{controlled}} the Arrowbile {{both on the}} road and in the air. [...] Outer wing elevons moved together to alter pitch and differentially to bank. [...] <b>The</b> <b>rudders,</b> interconnected with <b>the</b> elevons when the wheel was turned, moved only outwards, so in a turn only <b>the</b> inner <b>rudder</b> was used, both adjusting yaw as normal and assisting the elevon in depressing the inner wing tip. This system had been used on the Arrowplane as a safety feature to avoid the commonly fatal spin out of climb and turn from take-off accident but <b>the</b> raked <b>rudder</b> hinge of <b>the</b> Arrowbile provided the banking component even from a nose-down attitude. [...] There were no conventional flaps or wing mounted airbrakes but <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> could be operated as brakes by opening them outwards together with a control independent of the wheel. The cabin interior was designed to motor car standards, with easy access and a baggage space under the seats.|$|R

50|$|The {{gyroscope}} senses {{the rolling}} tilt degree in real-time. It inputs push-pull control operation force to a pilot valve, sliding {{it inside the}} main controller to switch two output valves exclusively to <b>the</b> <b>rudders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of <b>the</b> <b>rudder.</b> Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. <b>The</b> <b>rudder</b> was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The Firebrand {{required}} significant {{effort by}} Blackburn {{to produce a}} useful aircraft and the first discussions on a redesign of the aircraft with a laminar-flow wing took place in September 1943. The new wing was estimated to reduce {{the weight of the}} wing by 700lb (318kg) and increase the aircraft speed by 13mph (21km/h). The extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements. In October 1943, Blackburn's design staff, led by G.E. Petty, started work on this development of the Firebrand which led to Specification S.28/43 being issued by the Air Ministry on 26 February 1944 covering the new aircraft. The specification was designed around a Bristol Centaurus 77 radial engine with contra-rotating propellers that allowed the size of <b>the</b> <b>rudder</b> to be reduced.|$|E

50|$|The Wn 16's tail-booms were wooden monocoques. The {{rectangular}} tail-plane and elevator {{was on top}} of them, with oval vertical tails {{acting as}} end-plates; the fins had ply covered wooden frames and <b>the</b> <b>rudders</b> had fabric covered steel frames.|$|R
