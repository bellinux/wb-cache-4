5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
25|$|Well, no, no, I mean he's {{making an}} appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone {{watching}} what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you <b>think</b> <b>your</b> audience cares about.|$|E
25|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that the system is}} {{applicable}} with certainty and efficiency to the Cornwall Railway. That a sufficient power may be obtained so as to work the trains, which I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> traffic will require, at an average speed of 30 miles an hour for passenger trains, and from 15 to 20 miles an hour for goods, including stoppages in both cases, and that special trains may be despatched at greater speed if necessary.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{their careers}} Drake and Minaj {{maintained}} a close personal and business relationship, and were frequent collaborators. However, while recording Nothing Was the Same, Drake {{did not work}} with Minaj or anyone from Cash Money Records, leading her to say: [...] "I'm Young Money 'til the death of me, Drake can do what Drake do, but Nicki Minaj is a whole different person. I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> team is your team. Who gives a fuck about trying to be different? I'm always going to want my team {{to be a part}} of my project, no matter what, in some way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} Tresham's recruitment, Catesby {{exchanged}} greetings in London with Fawkes's former employer, Lord Montague, {{and asked him}} [...] "The Parliament, I think, brings your lordship up now?" [...] Montague {{told him that he}} was visiting a relative, and that he would be at Parliament in a few weeks' time. Catesby replied [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> Lordship takes no pleasure to be there". Montague, who had already been imprisoned for speaking out in the House of Lords against anti-Papist legislation, and who had no inclination to be present while more laws were introduced, agreed. Following the plot's failure he became a suspect and was arrested, but after intense lobbying he was released some months later.|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is most wonderful," [...] {{said the}} knight, {{looking to the}} bishop; [...] "the man is assuredly cured. I must conduct this mediciner {{presently}} to King Richard's tent. What <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> reverence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' {{if you get}} {{the cash}} you're goin' to blow it right in for what the doctor can tell you, an' sich stuff as he <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> old man ought to have eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, I do." [...] Mrs. Tappitt's manner {{became very}} solemn, {{and the girls}} listened with all their ears. [...] "Yes, my dear, I do. Mr. Honyman <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> father should give way." ...|$|R
500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really <b>think</b> <b>your</b> record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, Cope advertised the idea of the towel to fans on the radio and evening {{television}} news, using the phrase [...] "The Terrible Towel is poised to strike!" [...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea. Also against the idea of the Towel was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, [...] "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team." [...] Cope simply replied, [...] "Russell, you're sick." [...] Growing nervous about the negative feedback, Cope, who had already advertised the towel on the news multiple times, polled the rest of the players with a [...] "banana-republic vote".|$|E
500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] <b>think</b> <b>your</b> best days are behind you, and you should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
6000|$|He didn't {{wait for}} an answer. [...] "The Prince says I've got to look after you. Naturally he can't see you now, but he <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> coming's providential. Last grace of Heaven. Like a sign. Hullo!" ...|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} Mr. Spalding again entered the room. 'The young lad has called again, my lord. He says he <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> lordship has come to town, and he wishes to see your lordship very much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{might have}} been a sense of embarrassment in the way in which, as to gain time, Lady Sandgate pointed, instead of answering, to the small picture {{pronounced}} upon by Mr. Bender. [...] "He <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> little Cuyp a fraud." ...|$|R
500|$|Kurtzman {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Hefner and Playboy executive editor Ray Russell, who was interested in Kurtzman's idea of a comic strip suitable for the magazine's audience and suggested [...] "satire... as an excuse or rationale for a slick magazine to be publishing a comic strip." [...] Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented {{and had to be}} justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the [...] "fresh and eager" [...] character. He especially enjoyed [...] "Goodman Goes Playboy", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: [...] "Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series... that can somehow be related to Playboy". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver [...] "could be foolish {{and at the same time}} wise," [...] and that he [...] "innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good." [...] He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, [...] "What would you think of a girl character... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?" [...] Six weeks later Hefner replied, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a sexy girl... is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{stated that}} Valve's aim {{was not to}} make Portal 2 more {{difficult}} than its predecessor, but instead to produce [...] "a game where you <b>think</b> <b>your</b> way through particular parts of the level, and feel really smart when you solve it." [...] Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game's mechanics, an approach that led to two basic types of test chamber. The first type, which Valve calls [...] "checklisting", provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally, providing challenging and rewarding puzzles. Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings. The developers performed a sanity check on the chamber before crafting simple levels with a software tool called the Hammer level editor. Extensive playtesting ensured the solutions to each chamber were neither too obvious nor too difficult, and observed alternative solutions discovered by playtesters. Based on play-testing results, the design team retained these alternative solutions or blocked them if they were considered too easy. These versions were sent back for further play-testing to verify that the new elements did not prevent players from finding solutions; further iterations between artists and playtesters occurred until such issues were resolved. Some elements from Portal were modified to suit Portal 2; whereas players of Portal would {{be familiar with the}} game mechanics, novice players required some training, as would players of Portal for some game elements. For example, the energy spheres used in the first game were replaced with lasers, which provided immediate feedback and reduced the in-game training time.|$|E

6000|$|... "No fear of me lettin' him," [...] {{replied the}} trusty one. [...] "But {{the joke is}} this, Mr. Michael--see, ye're upsettin' the sauce, that's a clean table-cloth--the best of the joke is that he <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> father's dead and you're keepin' it dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{abruptly}} Mr. Stanley {{changed his}} key. [...] "You poor child!" [...] he said; [...] "don't {{you see the}} infinite folly of these proceedings? Think! Think of the love and affection you abandon! <b>Think</b> of <b>your</b> aunt, a second mother to you. <b>Think</b> if <b>your</b> own mother was alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>thinks</b> <b>your</b> lordship such gallants would mind these impediments? {{such are}} {{the very essence of}} the adventures which they come to seek.--The Knight of the Swan would swim through the moat--he of the Eagle would fly over the wails--he of the Thunderbolt would burst open the gates." ...|$|R
2500|$|I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> {{attempt to}} redefine the second race at St Cloud as the first {{velocipede}} race does not hold water. Velocipedes meant boneshakers, only occasionally was there the odd tricycle or quadricycle. Boneshakers began effectively in 1867 and St Cloud {{was just one of}} several minor meetings which Duncan [...] just happened to immortalise.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Anderson {{asked the}} Salt Lake City Police Department {{to end its}} {{participation}} in the DARE program. He told DARE officials: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> organization has been an absolute fraud {{on the people of}} this country... For you to continue taking precious drug-prevention dollars when we have such a serious and, in some instances, growing addiction problem is unconscionable." ...|$|E
2500|$|This tension further {{increased}} {{between the}} two, as Ackerman bumped into David Campese, Michael Lynagh and then Australian coach, Alan Jones, {{as they were}} entering the Angel Hotel in Cardiff. Ackerman {{walked up to the}} Wallabies coach and said {{in the presence of the}} two Australian backs, after Australia had beaten Wales 28–9, [...] "Congratulations, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> backs were too good today." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the third-season episode [...] "One Dumb Idea", Karen {{offers her}} idea on a {{character}} based on Findlay for a sitcom idea {{he was trying}} to come up with, saying, [...] "I think if you're gonna go for reality, or, sorry, for verisimilitude, I <b>think</b> <b>your</b> character should be deceitful and self-serving. Basically, pathologically ambitious and actually lacking in any real humanity." [...] In other words, a sociopath.|$|E
2500|$|Elsewhere, {{he spoke}} of the {{nonsense}} of higher mathematics and [...] "probability" [...] theory, after he read Angoff's article for Charles S. Peirce in the American Mercury. [...] "So you believe in that garbage, too—theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> god Peirce knew what he was talking about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Car and Driver {{declared}} [...] "Even {{the most}} jaded car critics {{are in fact}} tripping over each other {{trying to be the}} first to anoint this sedan to be the best full-sized Chevrolet ever made." [...] Car and Driver commented on the F41 suspension option which included stiffer springs, larger sway bars, wheels, and tires to say, [...] "It will make you <b>think</b> <b>your</b> Chevy came from the Black Forest instead of Detroit." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am not {{speaking}} about myself sir.

[...] "Do you <b>think</b> that <b>your</b> father, sir, followed such pursuits as these? Do {{you think that he}} spent his time in the pursuit of--rats?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There aint no ill {{feeling in}} us, Rebs.

So we are just {{soldiers}} together, and can feel for each other." ...|$|R
