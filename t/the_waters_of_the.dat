5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top {{of centuries}} of prehistoric {{alluvial}} deposits built by <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the marbled {{electric}} ray inhabits rocky reefs and seagrass beds, as well as nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Isles.|$|E

5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As {{an indication of the}} intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo {{accelerated}} toward <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Atlantic, passing {{close to}} southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy {{rain in the}} southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later {{played a role in}} triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E

The American destroyer soon {{arrived on the scene}} and helped to save the survivors of the stricken French warship from <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were rewarded by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E

The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver, and it is very possible that it belonged to Sviatoslav himself.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. <b>The</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E

5|$|The 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season had the {{earliest}} named storm since 1992.

The basin is defined as <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean west of longitude 90°E to the coast of Africa {{and south of the}} equator. Eleven tropical storms formed, compared to an average of nine. Tropical systems were present during 73days, which was significantly higher than the average of 58.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{government}} {{agreed to}} Beck's proposal, and the ultimatum was toned down. However, {{at the same}} time, Beck ordered military preparations. Poland assembled four divisions along the demarcation line; about 50,000 Polish troops were present, and just over 20,000 Lithuanian troops. The Polish troops were reinforced by armored vehicles, by two air force regiments, consisting of about one hundred aircraft, and by the Polish fleet in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea along the Lithuanian shore.|$|E

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. <b>The</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of titanium in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Creek watershed {{is less than}} 0.17 milligrams per liter and the {{concentration of}} zirconium is less than 0.055 milligrams per liter. Small amounts (less than 0.01 milligrams per liter) of vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum also occur in the water. The cobalt concentration in mine waters in the watershed ranges from 0.07 to 0.93 milligrams per liter and the nickel concentration ranges from 0.09 to 1.2 milligrams per liter. Copper, silver, tin, and lead also occur in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Anions in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate.

However, some mine waters in the watershed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
