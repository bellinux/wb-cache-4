5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{learns that}} she has a {{cancerous}} tumor between her sinus and cerebrum. She initially tells only Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) of the diagnosis, and is determined to continue to work. The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering from similar symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Jacques reports <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the police, {{who have}} been {{investigating}} the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, coerces a young woman named Paulette Mérodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. Génessier. Génessier {{is about to begin}} surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him.|$|E

5|$|That year Breckinridge {{accepted}} <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> pastor the Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland.

During the Old School-New School Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the 1830s, Breckinridge became a hard-line member of the Old School faction, and played an influential role in the ejection of several churches in 1837. He was rewarded for his stances by being elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> open {{a college}} in West Texas began shortly after {{settlers}} {{arrived in the}} area in the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A to be in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas {{went so far as to}} recommend West Texas secede from the state.|$|E

Though not meant to cover the entire field, the following sub-themes are discussed: • The historical context within which the Gereformeerde Kerke in Suid-Afrika originated in 1859. • <b>The</b> fundamental <b>calling</b> of <b>the</b> church <b>to</b> proclaim the Word of God in its purest form, and the importance of providing sound, scholarly education and training to theological students. • <b>The</b> <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> actualise <b>the</b> unity of the church, with reference to the relationship among the three major Afrikaans-speaking reformed denominations, ecumenism and unity across ethnic and language boundaries. • <b>The</b> <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> ensure justice in society, with brief reference to the Gereformeerde Kerke in Suid-Afrika and the ideology of apartheid. • <b>The</b> <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> bear testimony among people in society...|$|R
5|$|The {{hash value}} that this class {{associates}} with each object, its identityHashCode, {{is guaranteed to}} remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary. Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object, and {{is not required to}} be related to the object's address or value, its construction may involve slower computations such as <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> a random or pseudorandom number generator. For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E
50|$|In CB7, 80% of <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> 311 {{are either}} {{building}} complaints, noise complaints, city property damage/complaints, and {{lost and found}} property.

For instance, there were 79 total <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> 311 in October 2012 regarding damaged or dead trees in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, which reached New York City {{at the end of that}} month. In the next month, daily calls regarding trees dropped 25%, while daily calls regarding heating increased 58%.

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a plane accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Torres is forced to make the decision to have Alex Karev amputate Robbins's left leg to keep her alive, which puts strains on their relationship. The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. These doctors and Torres buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything seems to go well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In {{the aftermath}} of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona.|$|E
