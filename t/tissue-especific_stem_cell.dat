A common approach classi-fies <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into three different groupings: Embryonic <b>Stem</b> <b>Cells</b> (ESCs), Umbilical Cord <b>Stem</b> <b>Cells</b> (UCBSCs) and Adult <b>Stem</b> <b>Cells</b> (ASCs), which include <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from bone marrow (BM), fat tissue (FT), engineered induced pluripotent (IP) and peripheral blood (PB). By definition <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are progenitor cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation hypothetically âab infinitumâ into more specialized cells and tissue. The main intent of this study was to determine and charac-terize the different sub-groups of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> present within the human PB-SCs that may represen...|$|R
