500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?" [...] was often directed to her. Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during Meet the Press she was asked, [...] "Do you think <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The old sailor songs had a {{peculiar}} individuality. They were barbaric in their wild melody. The only songs <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> resemble them in character are [...] "Dixie", {{and two or}} three other so-called negro songs by the same writer. This man, known in the minstrel profession as [...] "Old Emmett", caught the true spirit of the African melodies—the lawless, half-mournful, half-exulting songs of the Kroomen. These and the sailor songs could never have been the songs of civilized men… ...|$|E
2500|$|Ch. v. {{deals with}} laws {{concerning}} interest, which {{have nothing in}} common with the laws concerning shomer ḥinnam beyond the fact that taking interest and cheating ("onaah" [...] of chap. iv.) both consist of an illegal addition to what is actually due. The laws prohibiting the taking of interest are very severe, and extend to all business transactions <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> resemble the taking of interest. The two terms for taking interest, [...] "neshekh" [...] (interest), and [...] "tarbit" [...] (increase), used in (...) are explained and illustrated by examples (ch. v. 1–10). According to the Mishnah [...] "the lender, who takes interest, the borrower who pays it, the witnesses, the security, and the clerk who writes the document, are all guilty of having broken the law concerning interest" [...] (ch. v. 11). (See Usury).|$|E
2500|$|In Silvestri's {{first meeting}} with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, [...] "To {{have some kind of}} musical {{signature}} either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." [...] For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to [...] "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man". He noted that Captain America is a [...] "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> But that doesn’t mean you have to play those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing [...] "a really bad guy" [...] in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and [...] "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character when he talks about his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.|$|E

60|$|They wish {{to destroy}} the State, which they regard as a {{capitalist}} institution, designed essentially to terrorize the workers. They refuse {{to believe that it}} would be any better under State Socialism. They desire to see each industry self-governing, but as to the means of adjusting the relations between different industries, they are not very clear. They are anti-militarist because they are anti-State, and because French troops have often been employed against them in strikes; also because they are internationalists, who believe that the sole interest of the working man everywhere is to free himself from the tyranny of the capitalist. Their outlook on life is the very reverse of pacifist, but they oppose wars between States on the ground that these are not fought for objects <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> concern the workers. Their anti-militarism, more than anything else, brought them into conflict with the authorities in the years preceding the war.
