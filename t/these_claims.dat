25|$|Palaeocontact or ancient {{astronaut}} theories, {{espoused by}} Erich von Däniken and others, are further examples of fringe theories. <b>These</b> <b>claim</b> that the Earth was visited in prehistoric times by extraterrestrial beings.|$|R
50|$|According to the Anglo-Israelists, <b>these</b> <b>claimed</b> {{connections}} {{would make}} the British the literal descendants of the Lost Tribes, and thus inheritors of the promises made to the Israelites in the Old Testament.|$|R
5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} {{negative}} health effects from noise {{on people who}} live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported <b>these</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} accomplishments in sports {{have been attributed}} to Clement, but cannot be confirmed because of poor record keeping at the time. <b>These</b> <b>claims</b> include winning tennis championships in Iowa and South Dakota and setting world records in shot put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball, where it is claimed that Clement threw a baseball 275 feet.|$|E
5|$|Military {{personnel}} {{who were involved}} in storage, mixture and transportation (including aircraft mechanics), and actual use of the chemicals were probably among those who received the heaviest exposures. Military members who served on Okinawa also claim to have been exposed to the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate <b>these</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|E
50|$|None of <b>these</b> <b>claim</b> to {{represent}} all Métis. Other Métis registry groups also focus on recognition {{and protection of}} their culture and heritage. They reflect their communities' particular extensive kinship ties and culture that resulted from settlement in historic villages along the fur trade.|$|R
5000|$|South Korea claims five provinces on the {{territory}} controlled by North Korea. <b>These</b> <b>claimed</b> provinces are managed by The Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces (...) [...] These provinces {{are based on}} the divisions of Japanese era and are different from the present North Korean provinces.|$|R
50|$|Typical claims involve being {{subjected}} to forced medical examinations that emphasize abductee reproductive systems. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons. While many of <b>these</b> <b>claimed</b> encounters are described as terrifying, some have been viewed as pleasurable or transformative.|$|R
5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's fandom {{is often}} criticized, mostly due to {{negative}} generalization of the community. Scott Cawthon made a post on Steam regarding <b>these</b> <b>claims,</b> defending the fandom and criticizing the wider community for the unfair generalization.|$|E
5|$|Time ran its own {{critique}} of the film-in-progress on June 10, 1991 and alleged that Stone was trying to suppress a rival JFK assassination film based on Don DeLillo's 1988 novel Libra. Stone rebutted <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> {{in a letter to}} the magazine.|$|E
5|$|Born into a rural working-class family, Pickingill {{grew up in}} Hockley, Essex and was baptised {{into the}} Church of England. Working as a farm labourer, in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman in Gravesend, Kent. The couple moved back to Essex, settled in Canewdon and had four children. Pickingill's wife died in 1887, and in later life he {{attracted}} limited press attention for his claim {{to be one of}} the oldest men in England. <b>These</b> <b>claims</b> also appeared in his obituaries, although were later shown to be incorrect.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{disputes}} concerning Spanish patrol boats inside <b>these</b> <b>claimed</b> territorial waters. In May 2009 {{there was a}} number of Spanish incursions into British-claimed waters around Gibraltar, including by a Spanish Navy fisheries protection vessel, leading to intervention by police and a diplomatic protest by the UK.|$|R
5000|$|Sihler {{encouraged}} zeal {{and love}} for the Word of God and the Lutheran Confessions. He especially criticized the General Synod for lacking <b>these,</b> <b>claiming</b> that their leaders, for example, Samuel Simon Schmucker, were apostate [...] "open counterfeiters, Calvinists, Methodists, and Unionists... traitors and destroyers of the Lutheran Church".|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>claimed</b> {{benefits}} are disputed as incomplete. For example, activists claim that land acquisition for Posco India will adversely affect betel farmers who {{in recent decades}} encroached upon government land to farm betel leaves and claim to earn INR 10 to 1750,000 (US$30,000) per hectare per year from growing betel leaves for paan.|$|R
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Following a minor injury, Wurmheller {{was again}} posted to the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen as an instructor. Upon {{his return to}} front line duty in May 1942, he was posted to 1. Staffel and claimed 10 {{victories}} during May 1942 and a further 12 victories the following month. Among <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> were four Spitfires shot down on 31 May and five on 5 June 1942. Most of these missions were flown with Rudolf Pflanz as his wingman.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian troops {{suffered}} 126 {{dead and}} 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some Volksdeutsche. Many civilians {{were arrested and}} tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, probably {{as a warning to}} others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{development}} interventions leading to displacement, indigenous livelihood strategies adapt by taking on new forms and combinations of crops and labour arrangements.

5|$|In 1995, as {{thousands}} {{of members of the}} church traveled to the Holy Supper celebration in Guadalajara, several members of a neighboring community supported by Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez protested the use of schools to provide temporary shelters for the Luz del Mundo pilgrims. The protesters said that after the ceremony the schools were left in disarray; however church authorities presented photographic evidence to newspapers to refute <b>these</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of <b>these</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 20 December, the LTTE {{mounted a}} counter-offensive as SLA forces were {{preparing}} an assault {{to capture the}} village of Iranamadu, located {{to the south of}} Kilinochchi. The LTTE claimed that at least 60 soldiers were killed in the battle, but <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> were again disputed by the military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, who claimed that SLA losses were 12 killed and 12 missing.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|Others counter <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> by {{pointing}} out that bathhouses are a major source of safer sex informationthey provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room {{as well as in the}} common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises. In cities with larger gay populations, STD and HIV testing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do {{occupies}} {{a prominent place}} in Australian taekwondo history. This is reflected in three key claims: (1) Chong Chul Rhee is the Father of Australian Taekwondo, (2) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the first taekwondo school in Australia, and (3) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the biggest taekwondo school in Australia. The school has widely publicised <b>these</b> <b>claims</b> {{since at least the}} 1980s.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} reason for purchasing organic foods seems to be beliefs about the products' health-giving properties and higher nutritional value. These beliefs are promoted by the organic food industry, and have fueled increased demand for organic food despite higher prices and difficulty in confirming <b>these</b> <b>claimed</b> benefits scientifically. Organic labels also stimulate the consumer to view the product as having more positive nutritional value.|$|R
