5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of <b>tea</b> <b>tree</b> oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. <b>Tea</b> <b>tree</b> oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for <b>tea</b> <b>tree</b> oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|The O-Bahn {{has caused}} a {{clustering}} of commercial and community development near the <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre.

50|$|Over {{three hundred}} years ago, the first wild <b>tea</b> <b>trees</b> were {{discovered}} in Taiwan. However these trees which {{were found in the}} wild were not grown on an estate or grown specifically for consumption as most teas are nowadays. Only two hundred years ago, Taiwanese people took <b>tea</b> <b>trees</b> from the Wuyi Mountains in the Fujian province to Taiwan and planted them in the North of Taiwan.After that, Taiwan began cultivating <b>tea</b> <b>trees</b> in <b>tea</b> gardens and producing tea from them. Taiwan has a climate {{which is one of the}} best for cultivating <b>tea</b> <b>trees</b> in the entire world, with high mountain ranges, a lot of sun and precipitation. Because of Taiwan's geography and climate, Taiwanese teas are some the best teas in the world. Taiwan produces green teas, Bau Jong tea (known in the Western World as Bau Jhong tea), Oolong teas, black teas and others. Taiwan Bau Jong tea and Taiwan Oolong tea are indeed famous throughout the world.|$|R

Since 1862, he had lobbied for construction of a road to link <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully to Anstey Hill Road. The 1½ mile road was eventually approved and subsequently opened in 1880.

5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water Gully were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied quartzite road metal for the District Council of <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully. A crushing plant was erected {{on the north side of}} the gully in 1912 to create this road material.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} Ellis Cottage and Rumps Bakery buildings lie {{near the}} corner of Perseverance and North East roads. Built in 1854, Ellis Cottage is a single room stone building built by John Stevens, founder of Steventon Estate that later become the suburb of <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully. It was named after the Ellis family, who owned and used the building for storage for many years until World War II. Rumps Bakery was built in 1854 with local stone. From 1867 to 1893 it was rented to Charles Rumps, who started <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully's first bakery in the building in 1872. In 1894, the building was sold to Ernest Heitmann, who continued {{to use it as}} a bakery. Until the mid-20th century, the Ellis family and an adjacent general store frequently used it for storage. Assisted by a government grant and supervised by the Department of Environment and Heritage, the Friends of Anstey Hill stabilised both buildings in 2000.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor.

The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
5|$|Dolomite, {{sandstone}} and quartzite rock {{have been}} extensively mined in the park. Though traces of silver, copper and gold are present, {{there have been}} no economic finds. The park is scattered with many quarries; the largest within the park is an open-cut in the northwest corner. It was in operation until 1982 supplying stone for buildings, including Adelaide's war memorial and St Peter's Cathedral. <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully Freestone from some quarries has been used for the facades and ornamental dressing of many of Adelaide’s Victorian public buildings. Adelaide Town Hall, the General Post Office and Supreme Court Buildings in Adelaide were all built entirely of this stone. The quarries supplied dressing stock for ornamentation on buildings, including St Peter's Cathedral, St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Flinders Street Baptist Church and the University of Adelaide's Mitchell Building.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by <b>tea</b> <b>tree</b> oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E

5|$|Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing {{heritage}} to {{the march}} of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, <b>Tea</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.|$|E

40|$|Species–area {{relationship}} has been widely addressed on many plant communities, but very few have conducted on epiphytic communities. Epiphytic plants are plentiful on ancient <b>tea</b> <b>trees</b> (Camelia sinensis var. assamica) in the well-known Jingmai tea plantation area, Langcang region of Yunnan Province, SW China, {{and add to the}} plant community biodiversity. We investigated 343 <b>tea</b> <b>trees</b> with various ground diameter, canopy area, under branch height, and tree height. A total of 146 vascular epiphytic plants, belonging to 19 species in seven families were recorded from the trunk or branches of 93 (27. 11 %) investigated trees. We examined in situ abundance, richness, and diversity (Shannon–Weiner index) of the recorded vascular epiphytes, and their relationships to tree variables. Our results showed that the distribution (abundance, richness, and diversity) of epiphytic plants are significantly related to the canopy area (p< 0. 05) and basal diameter (p< 0. 0001) of <b>tea</b> <b>trees,</b> supporting their use as key factors and good predictor for the epiphyte’s appearance in this type of agro-ecosystems.
