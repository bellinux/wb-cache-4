Before he could return, his mother died. In his first at-bat after surgery, he hit a home run to right field. Jackson had the ball encased in acrylic and bolted to the dresser in her room, according to an interview on ESPN.|$|E
25|$|King Arthur (Arthus) - Arthur is noble king of Britain, {{cultivating}} {{the ideal}} of the chivalrous knight operating under an honourable code of conduct. He started the fellowship of the Round Table after drawing the sword from the stone, thereby fulfilling a prophecy and proving his right to rule. Years ago, Merlin informed Arthur <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> was tricked into going to bed with Morgana, disguised by a spell, and the issue of their union was to be the instrument of Arthur's death. Arthur loves his wife, Guinevere dearly, but projects onto her an ideal which she cannot possibly live up to.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in {{free agency}} they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24million deal. That was to counter the {{defection}} of Vladimir Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for an extra year, but both players would make {{the same amount of}} money annually, which would be $6million. Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13million deal. Cassell stated <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> retired he would like to join the Clippers' coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. The team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{served as}} a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams. Williams had been {{classified}} 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mother's sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status {{should not have been}} changed. He made a public statement <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had built up his mother's trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by Quaker Oats, resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942.|$|E
25|$|Some years later, Tekkadan {{establishes}} {{itself as}} a prominent military company, while Kudelia establishes a mining company in Chryse, working to improve the inhabitants' conditions and McGillis moves forward with his agenda to reform Gjallarhorn. However, one of Gjallarhorn's factions opposing him, the Arianhod Fleet, led by Rustal Elion starts working in the shadows to sabotage both McGillis and Tekkadan, leading both to join forces against them, with McGillis promising <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> manages to take full control of Gjallarhorn, he will transfer all authority over Mars to Tekkadan, making them the de facto rulers of the planet. However, their coup d'etat fails, and {{they are forced to}} flee to Mars, where McGillis is killed after a last, failed attempt to kill Rustal and Tekkadan is disbanded after Arianhod launches an attack to exterminate all members and make an example out of them, but only a few, including Mikazuki, sacrifice themselves to hold out the enemy long enough for their companions to escape safely.|$|E

25|$|Louis VI chose Fulk V, Count of Anjou and Main, a renownedly rich crusader and {{military}} commander, {{and to some}} extent a growing threat to Louis VI himself. Fulk's son from a previous marriage, Geoffrey was married to Empress Matilda, Henry I of England's designated heir as England's next queen regnant. Fulk V could be a potential grandfather to a future ruler of England, a relationship that would out-flank Louis VI. Fulk's wealth, connections, and influence made him as powerful as the King of France, according to historian Zoe Oldenbourg. Throughout the negotiations Fulk insisted on being sole ruler of Jerusalem. Hesitant, Baldwin II initially acquiesced to these demands though would come to reconsider. Baldwin II perceived that Fulk, an ambitious man with grown sons to spare, was also a threat to Baldwin II's family and interest, and specifically a threat to his daughter Melisende. Baldwin II suspected <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had died, Fulk would repudiate Melisende, set her and her children aside in favor of Elias, Fulk's younger but full grown son from his first marriage as an heir to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the first}} Test of South Africa's tour of Australia in December, Prince {{suffered}} a broken thumb. Batsman JP Duminy was selected in his place. According to Prince, who in 2008 scored 900runs {{at an average}} of 64.28 from 13Tests including four centuries, he had been promised <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> recovered from his injury he would be back in the side. Instead South Africa persisted with Duminy, and Prince did not play another Test until the next series. Dropped from the first 12-man squad for the two Tests when Australia toured South Africa in February, Prince returned to the team for the third Test after captain Graeme Smith was injured and opener Neil McKenzie was dropped. Though he was used to batting in the middle order, Prince was asked to open in the absence of South Africa's settled opening pair. On his recall he was also asked to captain the side in place of the injured Smith, however the following day Cricket South Africa appointed Jacques Kallis to the role so that Prince could concentrate on his unfamiliar task of opening the batting. Opening with debutant Imraan Khan, Prince scored 150, his 11th Test century.|$|E
25|$|Season 5 {{introduces}} the demon Crowley, played by Mark Sheppard, {{who would become}} the Winchester's longest-recurring antagonist and occasional anti-hero in the series. Crowley appears in three episodes of season 5 to help the Winchesters seal Lucifer back in the Cage, believing <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> destroys humanity he will target all demonkind next. In season 6, Crowley becomes the King of Hell {{and one of the}} main antagonists working with Castiel to stop Archangel Raphael, the other main antagonist of season 6, from restarting the Apocalypse by harnessing the souls of Purgatory and splitting the power with Castiel. In season 7, Crowley becomes an anti-hero who helps the Winchesters against the threat of Leviathans led by Dick Roman, after they are released from Purgatory by Castiel. Crowley becomes the main antagonist of season 8, attempting to harness the Words of God and their powers and stop the Winchesters from sealing Hell forever. In season 9, Crowley becomes an unwilling prisoner of the Winchesters but is forced to deal with Abaddon trying to steal his position as King of Hell. Sheppard was promoted to series regular status for season 10.|$|E

500|$|After the election, McKinley offered Hanna {{the post}} of Postmaster General, which he turned down, hoping to become a senator if Sherman (whose term was to expire in 1899) was {{appointed}} to the Cabinet. [...] McKinley did not believe the rumors, which proved accurate, that the 73-year-old Sherman's mental faculties were failing, and offered him the position of Secretary of State on January4, 1897. Sherman's acceptance meant <b>that,</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> resigned, one of Ohio's Senate seats would be in the gift of Bushnell, with the appointee to serve until the legislature reconvened in January 1898.|$|E
500|$|Pedro was {{regarded}} with suspicion {{by his father}} and by the king's close advisers, all of whom clung {{to the principles of}} absolute monarchy. By contrast, the prince was a well-known, staunch supporter of liberalism and of constitutional representative monarchy. He had read the works of Voltaire, Benjamin Constant, Gaetano Filangieri and Edmund Burke. Even his wife Maria Leopoldina remarked, [...] "My husband, God help us, loves the new ideas." [...] JoãoVI postponed Pedro's departure for as long as possible, fearing <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> was in Portugal, he would be acclaimed king by the revolutionaries.|$|E
500|$|Southard's {{mother said}} <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> learned to read, he took full {{responsibility}} for his education. He was influenced academically by a paternal aunt, a Greek scholar who had graduated from Oberlin College. One of his cousins was a prominent attorney in Bath, England. Southard attended Boston Latin School, where his father, aunt and headmaster Arthur Irving Fiske sparked a lifelong interest in language {{and the meaning of}} words. Despite a tall, solid build and walking about [...] a day to school, he was awkward at manual labor and athletics. Southard graduated from Boston Latin School in 1893 with awards for reading and essay-writing.|$|E

The Fur Army did not leave them alone and on 5 May a force of 500 men attacked the Anglo-Egyptian garrison at Abiad and four days later the telegraph post [...] east of Abiad was also attacked. On 12 May, an RFC reconnaissance aircraft flew over El Fasher dropping leaflets to the population.

500|$|Haley {{said the}} first time he heard his name {{mentioned}} in conjunction with the character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet, which he appreciated, and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller. Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past—that of a child murderer—for about a [...] "minute and a half". Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker, Haley came to the realization quickly {{that at the end of}} the day he is doing a horror film, and this is just a fictional character. Haley said <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> embraced the idea of Freddy just being a [...] "mythical boogeyman", it became [...] "very freeing" [...] for him as an actor.|$|E
500|$|Piller {{described}} {{the addition of}} Ro to the cast as one of that season's biggest accomplishments, and was pleased that it was well received. He added that in [...] "Ensign Ro", they made a deliberate decision to have Ro embraced by Guinan {{in order to ensure}} that the fans warmed to the new addition. Piller felt that when Guinan took Ro to meet Captain Jean-Luc Picard in that episode, the character was effectively presenting Ro to the fans of the series and endorsing her. During the writing process, he felt <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> came across the friendship between Guinan and Ro that he believed [...] "we had really done something magnificent". Forbes, meanwhile, praised the writing and the cast of the series, saying that she had [...] "become very attached to Star Trek".|$|E

While his departure {{came as a}} surprise to ACAC, Brain had for some time felt shackled by having to run TAA on a commercial basis under the control of a government bureaucracy, and on a public servant's remuneration. His anticipated salary increases had been less than he expected under the terms of his employment; Watt's attempts to make good on them had been resisted by Federal Cabinet. The government yet feared <b>that,</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had resigned, Brain might attempt to sue for back pay, though he assured Watt that this was not his intention. Nevertheless, in November he received a Cabinet-approved ex gratia payment totalling £6,250, in recognition of his [...] "long and distinguished service to civil aviation in Australia".|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the album}} began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from {{frequent}} collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins.

Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, [...] "How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?". He stated <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E

Lastly, in Ryō's story, he is a soft-spoken boy who wants to be an idol so he {{can be seen as a}} [...] "cool" [...] guy. He consults his cousin and 765 Pro idol Ritsuko Akizuki about it, who introduces him to 876 Pro's manager Manami Okamoto. At 876 Pro, Ryō ends up covering for a female idol, and he does so well that the agency decides to hires him, but only if he debuts as a female idol. Ishikawa assures him <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> proves himself as a female idol, that she will help him make the transition into being a male idol. Manami is the manager for both Ai and Ryō in their respective scenarios. The rest of the story deals with the training Ai, Eri and Ryō go through on their way to stardom.|$|E
