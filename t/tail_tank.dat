40|$|Reprinted from Waterpower ' 87, Proceedings of the International Conference on Hydropower ASCE, Portland, OR, August 19 - 21, 1987. The St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory (SAFHL) is {{presently}} upgrading their Turbine Test Facility. Completion of the upgrade, including checkout tests, {{is scheduled for}} Fall 1987. This paper will discuss the improvements being made to the Facility. The upgrades include enclosure of the upper portion of the test loop (head tank, <b>tail</b> <b>tank,</b> and dynamometer), to enable year-around operation. A temperature control system is being constructed and installed in the test loop which will provide temperature stability, necessary for cavitation testing, and required by IEC model test codes. Installation of additional instrumentation will provide for simpler, more efficient, data acquisition. The Facility is being connected to the Laboratory compressed air and vacuum facilities for pressure control. The existing Laboratory deaeration equipment will be incorporated to allow accurate dissolved gas content control not generally available in turbine test facilities. The SAFHL Turbine Test Facility {{will be available to}} undertake specific projects for the hydropower community funded by a variety of industries, agencies, and organizations. Projects might include performing model tests for small manufactures, prototype tests of micro-turbine units, model acceptance tests, comparative model tests, as well as a wide range of basic research experiments. The Facility will also be used as a demonstration tool in the instruction of students and hydropower engineers as part of SAFHL's active hydropower education program...|$|E

Since German aircraft engineers were aware that tailless designs might encounter serious stability problems at transonic speeds, much as the prototype Me 163B V18 did on July 6, 1944 in hitting a record 1,130 km/h (702 mph) top speed and nearly destroying its entire rudder surface in the process, [...] a variety of stabilization methods such as airbrakes on the wings were considered for such aircraft or simply adding conventional <b>tail</b> surfaces.

40|$|In recent years, {{emissions}} of hydrogen cyanide from metallurgical operations have received renewed attention by legislative bodies, {{leading to the}} need for a reliable quantification method for HCN volatilisation. Subsequently, the purpose of this project, launched by Anglogold Ashanti Ltd. and in collaboration with MINTEK and the University of Pretoria, was to develop a prediction model for cyanide volatilisation from plant operations and tailings storage facilities in South Africa. The study was done in four stages, the first being a laboratory study of the equilibrium behaviour of hydrogen cyanide. Henry’s Law constant (kH) was determined at different solution cyanide concentrations, salinities and temperatures. A value for kH was established at 0. 082 atm. L/mol, which was found to be independent on the solution cyanide concentration between 10 and 200 ppm cyanide. In addition, the effect of temperature on kH was found to be negligible at solution temperatures between 20 and 35 ºC. It was also concluded that high salinities increase kH and promote volatilisation, but this effect was negligible at the typical salinity levels found in South African process water. The second stage entailed a detailed study of the mass transfer coefficient, KOL, for hydrogen cyanide from cyanide solutions and pulp mixtures, both in the laboratory and on-site. It followed from this investigation that the most important parameters affecting KOL are the HCN (aq) concentration in the liquid, the wind velocity across the solution or pulp surface, expressed in terms of a Roughness Reynolds number, Re*, and the moisture content, or solid to liquid ratio, of the pulp. Furthermore, it was concluded that KOL is highly sensitive to HCN (aq) concentrations at low concentrations, while it becomes rather insensitive to HCN (aq) at concentrations above 20 ppm HCN (aq). The data generated by the laboratory and on-site test work was incorporated into the development of an empirical prediction model, based on the Roughness Reynolds number (Re*), moisture content (M), and aqueous cyanide concentration (HCN(aq)) which may be described by the following equation: KOL= a Re*b Mc HCN(aq) d + e The model coefficients were subsequently determined for application of the model to leach <b>tanks,</b> adsorption <b>tanks,</b> <b>tailing</b> storage facility surfaces and return water dams. The calculated model predictions for KOL were in excellent agreement with the measured test work data. Finally, the prediction model was validated at the leach and adsorption sections of a selected gold plant and a selected tailings storage facility. The model predicted that 9 % of the cyanide lost in the leach and adsorption section could be attributed to HCN volatilisation. As for the tailings storage facility, the model assigned 63 % of the cyanide lost from the tailings storage facility to HCN volatilisation, of which 95 % occurred from the area on the tailings dam surface covered in a thin liquid film. It is recommended that the current methods available for the determination of HCN (aq) be further improved, due to the sensitivity of the model to the input value of the HCN (aq) concentration, {{in order to ensure that}} reliable predictions are made. It is also suggested that additional validation work be done in order to establish the generic applicability of the model to different sites.
