5|$|Major-thirds <b>tuning</b> has {{a smaller}} scope than {{standard}} guitar-tuning, and so Patt started using seven-string guitars, which enabled major-thirds <b>tuning</b> {{to have the}} E-e' range of the standard <b>tuning.</b> He first experimented with a wide-neck Mango guitar from the 1920s, which he modified to have seven strings in 1963. In 1967 he purchased a seven-string by José Rubio. Patt used major-thirds <b>tuning</b> when he performed as a session musician in New York City after 1965.|$|E
5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds <b>tuning.</b> Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard <b>tuning</b> require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard <b>tuning,</b> the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E

5|$|In {{standard}} <b>tuning,</b> playing {{scales of}} one octave requires three patterns, which {{depend on the}} string of the root note.

5|$|Instructional {{literature}} uses standard <b>tuning.</b> Traditionally {{a course}} {{begins with the}} hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) may prefer standard <b>tuning</b> over an M3tuning. In particular, hobbyists playing folkmusic around a campfire are well served by standard <b>tuning.</b> Such hobbyists may also play major-thirds <b>tuning,</b> which also has many open chords with notes on five or six strings; chords with five-six strings have greater volume than chords with three-four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars (for example, acoustic-electric guitars without amplification).|$|E
5|$|Major-thirds <b>tuning</b> was {{introduced}} in 1964 by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt. He was studying with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, ArnoldSchoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds <b>tuning</b> by 1964, perhaps in 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) <b>tuning,</b> Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds <b>tuning</b> during all of {{his work as a}} session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds <b>tuning.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C <b>tuning,</b> or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D <b>tuning,</b> or a half-step down from standard <b>tuning.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the <b>tuning</b> can be significant. <b>Tuning</b> the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no <b>tuning</b> or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds <b>tuning</b> repeats every note {{in a higher}} octave, because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this {{repetition}} simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds <b>tuning.</b> Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.|$|E

5|$|Unlike westernized instrumentation, {{there is}} no set <b>tuning</b> for kulintang sets {{throughout}} the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set {{due to differences in}} make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the <b>tuning</b> varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This <b>tuning</b> system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.|$|E
