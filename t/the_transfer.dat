40|$|Transferring {{of public}} library {{services}} to the local administrations {{is one of the}} issues that are constantly on the agenda in recent years in Turkey. Discussions about this issue generally come to a conclusion that favorable conditions for <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> of public libraries have not occurred yet. In those discussions also, it is emphasized that necessary legal arrangements must be made and adequate conditions have to be provided for the local administrations in the fields of budget, personnel and infrastructure etc. before <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> takes place. As the latest point reached in, according to the draft law related to <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> which is a long-awaited one in Parliament, the 81 province public libraries and central district public libraries that are connected to the metropolis cities will remain under the administration of Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, General Directorate of Libraries and Publications but remaining district public libraries will be <b>transferred</b> to <b>the</b> special provincial administrations. The aim of the study is “to determine whether there are appropriate conditions or not for the realization of <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> in terms of the special provincial administrations by getting opinions of special provincial administration directors about <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> of <b>the</b> public libraries to the special provincial administrations”. This research covers a total of 162 special provincial administrations including 81 cities and 81 districts in Turkey. Within the scope of the research, surveys were posted to 162 administration directors and 125 of them participated in the research with their answers. Hypothesis of the study was developed as follows; “special provincial administration directors in Turkey think that <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> of <b>the</b> public libraries to the special provincial administrations will not change the public libraries’ current situation. Results of the research show that most of the special provincial administration directors in Turkey are unwilling to <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> of public libraries to the special provincial administrations in the existing conditions. The directors think that legal arrangements to draw a special frame for these services should be made and a planned process should be monitored applying pilot studies before <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> takes place. <b>The</b> directors also believe that no change will occur in the public library services in general and the public libraries will generate unnecessary work loads for the special provincial administrations in case of <b>the</b> <b>transferring.</b> Besides, positively, directors think that the special provincial administrations will give adequate support and importance to the public libraries and they will not have a problem in fulfilling their responsibilities for them in case of the realization of <b>the</b> <b>transferring.</b> <b>The</b> issue of <b>the</b> <b>transferring</b> of <b>the</b> public libraries to the special provincial administrations should be discussed by experts, professional people and institutions in the field, after building of a legal infrastructure related to the subject, the decision should be made on the basis of scientific data...|$|R
