5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|Billy Smith of the New York Islanders, in the 1979–80 season, was {{the first}} goaltender to be {{credited}} with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net. Smith was the last Islander to have touched the puck, and by NHL rule 78.4, an unassisted goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team who had contacted the puck, in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> own goal.|$|E
5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to propel the crew far enough in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E

50|$|Beside {{the tower}} was a {{monitoring}} station (one of hundreds across the country) {{to record the}} blast and fallout in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear war. <b>The</b> station provided for three men from the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) to live underground whilst recording what was happening above ground in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear strike.|$|R

5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exploding main gear tire.|$|E
5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American invasion.|$|E
5|$|New York Governor George Pataki urged {{residents}} to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began {{preparing for the}} hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.|$|E

5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways. Drivers are often drunk and not wearing seat belts. Speeding is common. Deer, elk and moose crossing the highway {{add to the}} risk compared to urban highways. In <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident in a remote area, injured victims may not receive emergency medical care in time to save their lives.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6 was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} manned Soyuz spacecraft, which carried out crew rotations and would also {{have been used in}} <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency evacuation. The ferries docked automatically to the station, making use of the new Igla automatic docking system, and were used by departing crews to return to Earth {{at the end of their}} flight.|$|E
5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups {{of women and children}} to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Pearl Harbor attack, in December 1941, {{construction}} began on a hardened bunker {{to the east}} of the White House grounds that would provide a secure refuge for the president in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> air raid against the capital city. To hide construction of the facility from the public, the East Wing was built on top of the bunker. This facility would later become the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz {{spacecraft}} provided manned {{access to}} and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return, and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station, allowing for a relatively quick return to Earth in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Two models of Soyuz flew to Mir; Soyuz T-15 was the only Igla-equipped Soyuz-T to visit the station, whilst all other flights used the newer, Kurs-equipped Soyuz-TM. A total of 31 (30 manned, 1 unmanned) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E

5|$|The Army first {{established}} {{a presence in}} Ashford in 1797 when it built a garrison on Barrow Hill, and storerooms along what is now Magazine Road. The military presence was scaled back during the 19th century, though the town was still considered strategically important in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion. The Territorial Army {{established a}} presence in Ashford in 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin crisis brought III Corps back {{to active}} duty {{for the fourth time}} on 1 September 1961. Units participated in an {{intensive}} training program and were operationally ready by December 1961. In February 1962, the Department of the Army designated III Corps as a unit of the U.S. Strategic Army Corps and in September 1965, assigned III Corps to the U.S. Strategic Army Forces. Throughout much of the 1960s, III Corps and its subordinate units trained for rapid deployment to Europe in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outbreak of war there.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they could possibly continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
