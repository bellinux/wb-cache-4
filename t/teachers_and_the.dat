5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the code switching employed by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students in English classroom at Palapa English Course in Sumenep Madura. Furthermore, the study is intended to know the codes switched by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students in English classroom instruction, kinds of code switching used by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students, <b>and</b> why do <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students used code switching in teaching learning process. In this study the descriptive qualitative research design was used. The subjects {{of this study were}} <b>the</b> English <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> advanced level students at Palapa English Course in Sumenep, Madura. The writer analyzed the natural discourse between <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students in English classroom. There were two instruments in taking the data. They were non participant observation and unstructured interview. There were three results found by the writer. First, both <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students switched code from English to Indonesia or vice versa. Besides, they switched code in the form of words, phrases <b>and</b> sentences. Second, <b>the</b> kinds of code switching used by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students were: (1) based on the topic changing (situational code switching and metaphorical code switching), (2) based on scope of setting (intrasentential code switching, intersentential code switching, and tag question), (3) based on permanent code switching (permanent code switching and temporary code switching), and (4) based on language used (internal code switching and external code switching). The last result was the reason of the usage of code switching. The teacher used code switching to clarify the difficult concepts or terms to make the students understand some information or knowledge easily during the classroom instruction; to avoid boring situation; and to maintain conducive communication. Meanwhile, the students used code switching because they lacked ability in using certain English terms to answer and ask questions in the class...|$|R

Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory kindergarten, remedial programs for elementary school children, mandatory testing and internship for <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.|$|E

5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E
