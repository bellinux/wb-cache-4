5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E

When s t ∈ S T and n d ∈ N D, the function P^G([...] S^t,n^d) →{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } expresses the privilege level of s t in n d.

Figure 3-3, which is from Belenky et al., however, demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> who spent 9 hours in bed did not approach these levels of impairment, indicating that 9 hours in bed {{may be needed}} to alleviate the risk of performance errors.|$|E
25|$|Building on his {{interests}} in belief and religion, Harris completed a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at UCLA. He used fMRI to explore whether the brain responses differ between sentences <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> judged as true, false, or undecidable, {{across a wide}} range of categories including autobiographical, mathematical, geographical, religious, ethical, semantic, and factual statements.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented similar findings. In one study, when {{participants were given}} cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, the results showed a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{individual}} {{freedom of religion}} in Switzerland—or indeed all of Europe—at that time anyway. The maxim of cuius regio, eius religio ("whose region, his religion") meant <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> had to adopt the faith of their rulers. Dissenters who didn't want to convert typically had to (but also were allowed to) emigrate elsewhere, into a region where their faith was the state religion. The Bullinger family, for instance, had to move from Bremgarten in the Freiamt, which was re-Catholicised after the second war of Kappel, to the Protestant city of Zürich.|$|E
25|$|When {{academics}} {{talk about}} coordination failure, most cases are <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> achieve risk dominance rather than payoff dominance. Even when payoffs are better when players coordinate on one equilibrium, many times people will choose the less risky option {{where they are}} guaranteed some payoff and end up at an equilibrium that has sub-optimal payoff. Players {{are more likely to}} fail to coordinate on a riskier option when the difference between taking the risk or the safe option is smaller. The laboratory results suggest that coordination failure is a common phenomenon in the setting of order-statistic games and stag-hunt games.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{plays a role}} in {{the conscious}} awareness of emotion (feelings) resulting in perception of feeling, but experiments suggest the left and right amygdala have distinct roles in conscious and unconscious processing of emotion. The right amygdala {{plays a role in}} the nonconscious processing of emotion while the left amygdala was involved in the processing of conscious emotions. These results were obtained from studies that masked conditioning stimuli. Stimuli were presented over {{a very short period of}} time such <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> were not consciously aware of the stimuli but were still able to show physiological changes.|$|E

25|$|Research {{in future}} input systems hold {{a great deal}} of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as brain–computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller proved that naïve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.|$|E
25|$|Research done {{in animals}} has shown <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> {{recovering}} in an enriched environment 15 days {{after having a}} stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention {{than those who were}} not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities {{are much more likely to}} be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.|$|E
25|$|From the {{research}} that has been conducted on TCKs, {{it has been found}} <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> are generally more tolerant of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments. Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either fluent in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.|$|E

25|$|Study of the {{unconscious}} mind, {{a part of the}} psyche outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C. S. Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference. Freud popularized this concept, with terms like Freudian slip entering popular culture, to mean an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech and action. His 1901 text The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogues hundreds of everyday events which Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.|$|E
25|$|For neck pain, {{manipulation}} and mobilization produce similar changes, and manual therapy and exercise {{are more effective}} than other strategies. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review found {{that there is no}} high quality evidence assessing the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for treating neck pain. Moderate to low quality evidence suggests that multiple spinal manipulation sessions may provide improved pain relief and an improvement in function when compared to certain medications. Due to the potential risks associated with spinal manipulation, high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the clinical role of spinal manipulation. A 2007 systematic review reported that there is moderate- to high-quality evidence <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> with chronic neck pain, not due to whiplash and without arm pain and headaches, show clinically important improvements from a course of spinal manipulation or mobilization. There is not enough evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is an effective long-term treatment for whiplash although there are short term benefits.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian pharaohs {{held the}} highest {{positions}} in Egyptian society, both in {{religious and political}} spheres. Kings were revered as gods in human form. Ellen F. Morris, a professor in Columbia University's Department of Anthropology, suggests that pharaohs used retainer sacrifices {{as a way to}} flaunt their power. She also argues that pharaohs would have to have significant power, in both a political and religious sense, to convince their subjects that it was worth sacrificing their lives on earth for the pharaoh and his comfort in the next life. In addition, their families would have to be convinced that the pharaoh's comfort in the life to come was important enough to allow their loved ones to be sacrificed. This would not be possible if those being sacrificed did not have a very strong belief in the life to come. Egypt's government had to convince the people that the king was a god, and what belonged to him in his life on earth, belonged to him in the afterlife also. Dr. David O'Connor, from New York University Institute of Fine Arts, proposes <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> of a king being willing to escort him into the afterlife demonstrates that a change had occurred in the way the Egyptians viewed their king.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, {{however, the}} Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and {{moved from the}} liberalist to neoliberalist {{point of view of}} how to deal with {{imperial}} possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard the rights of the natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat. With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order. This was due to the assumption <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation to educate them in the sphere and set an example. The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding racial differences which could not weaken it. This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, something {{that a large number of}} Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.|$|E
500|$|Nuttin {{concluded}} that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, acoustical, aesthetic, semantic, and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters. He framed the effect {{in the context of}} narcissism, Gestalt theory and awareness, as reflected in the title of his 1985 article [...] "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which [...] "beyond Gestalt" [...] refers to the fact <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and [...] "beyond awareness" [...] to the fact <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.

500|$|Some {{experiments}} give subjects a [...] "distractor" [...] task {{to ensure}} <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> are not consciously {{paying attention to}} the experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes attentional resources to it. [...] For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli. [...] The subjects showed a mismatch response (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attentionor at least <b>that</b> <b>subjects</b> were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.|$|E
