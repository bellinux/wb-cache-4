5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even their pets.|$|E
5|$|Nikki Finn is a {{carefree}} young woman, who {{is always}} dressed in a leather jacket and skirt, with fire-red lips, platinum bob hair and speaking in a high-pitched voice. One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> a safety deposit box and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch Johnny and murder him, then frame Nikki by putting his body {{into the trunk of}} her car. Nikki is sentenced to seven years in prison. This is seen during the animated opening credits of the film.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> {{each of the three}} units inform upon each other, {{in the same way as}} was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E

25|$|In their imaginative use of {{traditional}} iconography the artists {{put us in}} touch with a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth dimension. Behind <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> these volumes we meet not only the theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from the contemplation of the realities to which their symbols pointed. There is nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

In {{a review of the}} book for The Palm Beach Post, Lisa McDonough wrote [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late To Stop Now is not the final answer on Morrison – only Morrison could give that – but he does provide insights and updates as well as a solid background on Morrison's early life." [...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E

2500|$|The city of Taxco lies on very {{rugged terrain}} and has steep, {{irregular}} streets. [...] The streets are also narrow and generally lack sidewalks, making them picturesque but dangerous.

Some of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> the street are from the Zodiac and meant to indicate certain commercial activities in times past.

2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to broadcast QI in the United States.

Lloyd {{said in an interview with}} TV Squad that: [...] "No country in the world has bought the original show and this is partly a matter of cost. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>in</b> the background of the show are only cleared for UK usage, so until the show is bought by a Stateside TV company and the rights cleared for World, the programme (is) unaffordable by smaller countries." [...] Amongst the famous names also to express anger over QI not being shown in the US include comedian John Hodgman, who appeared as a [...] "fifth guest" [...] in the second episode of Series G.
