50|$|The Vicks {{manage to}} find two small ice-ant nests {{to spend the}} next night in, and remain there through the next day and night. The next day's journey brings them into the Mountains of the Damned. When the {{temperature}} drops to 140 below zero, they take shelter in a mountain cave. There they find themselves facing a Titanian <b>threadworm.</b> Tim is almost lulled to sleep by its hypnotic buzzing, but Diane wakes him, and he shoots it. They block the entrance to a <b>threadworm</b> nest and Diane falls asleep. Tim takes out their last flame-orchid and finds it shattered. Angrily he pounds it into dust with a rock.|$|E
50|$|Ingestion of {{helminth}} (worm) Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm, or <b>threadworm)</b> eggs {{leads to}} enterobiasis, indicative of severe itching around the anus from migration of gravid females from the bowel. Severe cases of enterobiasis result in hemorrhage and eczema.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, santonin was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} anthelminthic, typically administered with a purgative. Santonin was used in treatment of infestation by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and in ascarid parasitoses in general (including <b>threadworm</b> parasitosis). It is ineffective in treatment of tapeworm infestation.|$|E

25|$|The {{second group}} {{contains}} the <b>threadworms,</b> roundworms, and hookworms. This phylum is called Nematoda. <b>Threadworms</b> may be microscopic, {{such as the}} vinegar eelworm, or more than 1 metre (3feet) long. They are found in damp earth, moss, decaying substances, fresh water, or salt water. Some roundworms are also parasites. The Guinea worm, for example, gets under {{the skin of the}} feet and legs of people living in tropical countries.|$|R
50|$|Oxibendazole is a {{benzimidazole}} {{drug that}} is used to protect against roundworms, strongyles, <b>threadworms,</b> pinworms and lungworm infestations in horses and some domestic pets. It is usually white to yellowish in appearance, and may {{take the form of a}} powder or a tablet.|$|R
50|$|Strongyloides (from Greek strongylos, round, + eidos, resemblance), anguillula, or <b>threadworm</b> is a genus {{of small}} {{nematode}} parasites, {{belonging to the}} family Strongyloididae, commonly found in the small intestine of mammals (particularly ruminants), that are characterized by an unusual lifecycle that involves one or several generations of free-living adult worms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Threadworm</b> — Nematoidus Titani. Semi-sentient {{worm-like}} animal, with {{a single}} eye on a stalk and one fang, capable of hypnotizing its prey with a horrific buzzing noise that vibrates through the ice and parilyzes its intended kill. Always found among the ruins of an ancient Titanian civilization, of which this species may be the creator. (Flight on Titan, The Mad Moon) ...|$|E
50|$|The pinworm (species Enterobius vermicularis), {{also known}} as <b>threadworm</b> (in the United Kingdom and Australasia) or seatworm, is a {{parasitic}} worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans. The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as pinworm infection (enterobiasis) (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis {{in reference to the}} family Oxyuridae.|$|E
50|$|Slug mites are {{a concern}} for {{commercial}} and hobbyist breeders of snails; as few as six mites can sicken an individual and make it susceptible to infection by <b>threadworms</b> and bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Countermeasures include regular washing and introduction of Hypoaspis miles, a predatory species of mite which feeds upon slug mites.|$|R
25|$|Parasitic infection, {{especially}} with <b>threadworms</b> (Strongyloides westeri) and ascarids (Parascaris equorum) can produce signs of colic in foals (See Ascarids). Other conditions {{that may lead}} to signs of colic in foals include congenital abnormalities, gastric ulcers (see Gastric ulceration), which may lead to gastric perforation and peritonitis, small intestine volvulus, and uroabdomen secondary to urinary bladder rupture.|$|R
40|$|Over {{a period}} of 33 months in a {{paediatric}} accident and emergency department, the clinical pattern and possible causes of vulvovaginitis were studied prospectively in 200 girls presenting with genital discharge, irritation, pain, or redness. The major causes were poor hygiene and <b>threadworms.</b> The suspicion of sexual abuse arose in a few girls but no organisms of sexually transmitted disease were found. Urinary symptoms were common but only 20 patients had a significant bacteriuria and 40 had sterile pyuria. Specific skin problems occurred in 28 cases. Simple measures to improve hygiene and treatment of <b>threadworms</b> gave effective relief. Genital irritation caused urinary symptoms with no clinical evidence of infection, and it is advised that antibiotic treatment should await urine culture. Specific skin problems require help from a dermatologist. The possibility of sexual abuse must be considered especially if the vulvovaginitis is persistent or recurrent after adequate treatment...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Chinese Materia Medica", it {{is noted}} that the seeds of Iris qinghainica are used as a {{traditional}} Chinese herbal medicine. The seeds are harvested between July and August. The husk is removed with any other impurities and then dried. The seeds taste bitter or slightly sweet. They are taken as an oral dose. 3-9g of powder or a decoction. It is used to treat roundworm (as a anthelmintic), pinworm (or <b>threadworm),</b> appendicitis and food poisoning.|$|E
5000|$|Other than human, Enterobius vermicularis were {{reported}} from bonnet macaque. Other species seen in primates include Enterobius buckleyi in Orangutan [...] and Enterobius anthropopitheci in chimpanzee. Enterobius vermicularis {{is common in}} human children and transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Humans are the only natural host of Enterobius vermicularis. Enterobius gregorii, another human species is morphologically indistinguishable from Enterobius vermicularis except the spicule size. Throughout this article, the word [...] "pinworm" [...] refers to Enterobius. In British usage, however, pinworm refers to Strongyloides, while Enterobius is called <b>threadworm.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coprological {{examinations}} involve {{examining the}} feces of animals {{to identify and}} count parasite eggs. Some common methods include fecal flotation and sedimentation to separate eggs from fecal matter. Others include the McMaster method, which uses a special two-chamber slide that allows parasite eggs to be more clearly visible and easily counted. It is most commonly used to monitor parasites in horses and other grazing and livestock animals. The Baermann method is similar but requires more specialized equipment and more time and is typically used to diagnose lungworm and <b>threadworm.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Human parasites {{including}} roundworms, the Guinea worm, <b>threadworms</b> and tapeworms {{are mentioned}} in Egyptian papyrus records from 3000 BC onwards; the Ebers papyrus describes hookworm. In ancient Greece, parasites including the bladder worm {{are described in}} the Hippocratic Corpus, while the comic playwright Aristophanes called tapeworms [...] "hailstones". The Roman physicians Celsus and Galen documented the roundworms Ascaris lumbricoides and Enterobius vermicularis.|$|R
5000|$|Helminthic therapy, an {{experimental}} type of immunotherapy, is {{the treatment of}} autoimmune diseases and immune disorders by means of deliberate infestation with a helminth or with the ova of a helminth. Helminths are parasitic worms such as hookworms, whipworms, and <b>threadworms</b> that have evolved to live within a host organism on which they rely for nutrients. These worms are members of two phyla; nematodes, which are primarily used in human helminthic therapy, and flat worms.(Trematodes) ...|$|R
50|$|Hermann Munk (3 February 1839 - 1 October 1912) was a Jewish German physiologist. He {{was born}} at Posen, studied at Berlin and Göttingen, and in 1862 became docent in the former university. Seven years {{afterward}} {{he was promoted to}} assistant professor, and in 1876 to professor of physiology at the veterinary college at Berlin. Besides studies on the productive methods of <b>threadworms,</b> Munk wrote on the physiology of the nerves and especially on the brain.|$|R
5000|$|After {{spending}} {{a few months in}} the wild, Mogok contracted a massive <b>threadworm</b> infection, and trackers found him very weak. He was evacuated back to Nyaru Menteng in late August 2013. Despite 24-hour veterinary treatment, he died on September 12, 2013. Ms. Nielsen admitted, [...] "It is extremely sad to lose an orangutan that we worked so hard to rehabilitate and return to the wild, but we were always realistic from the start that not all of our orangutans would make it - even wild orangutans die in the forest to illness or injuries." ...|$|E
50|$|Mebendazole is {{a highly}} effective, broad-spectrum antihelmintic {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} nematode infestations, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, <b>threadworm,</b> pinworm, and the intestinal form of trichinosis prior to its spread into the tissues beyond the digestive tract. Other drugs are used to treat worm infections outside the digestive tract, as mebendazole is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream. Mebendazole is used alone in those with mild to moderate infestations. It kills parasites relatively slowly, and in those with very heavy infestations, it can cause some parasites to migrate out of the digestive system, leading to appendicitis, bile duct problems, or intestinal perforation. To avoid this, heavily infested patients may be treated with piperazine, either before or instead of mebendazole. Piperazine paralyses the parasites, causing them to pass in the feces. It is also used rarely in the treatment of hydatid disease. Evidence for effectiveness for this disease, however, is poor.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrum}} of core competence of phytomedicine is complemented by areas which concentrate on special classes of pathogens, e.g. agricultural entomology (concerned with animal pathogens, particularly insects and spiders and their adversaries, {{of which a}} number {{play a role in}} biological plant protection), agricultural mycology (fungal pathogens as a cause of fungal disease), agricultural bacteriology (bacterial pathogens), agricultural virology (viruses as plant pathogens), nematology (<b>threadworm</b> pathogens) and malacology (snails and slugs). In addition there is agricultural herbologie (weeds in general as competitors of the crop). This aetiological, cause-oriented approach led on one hand to a marked increase in our knowledge of the many and various causes of plant damage, {{but on the other hand}} in some cases even the simplest factors affecting the causes of damage under production conditions remain unclear. Nowadays the larger picture is being investigated. The areas of phytomedicine have become particularly important, as they are usually related to several or all groups of pathogen and often include non-parasitic causes of damage. Attempts are being made to highlight the state of plants that are at danger from pathogens or are already damaged. In contract to human medicine, phytomedicine targets the whole plant population for protection.|$|E

40|$|Infections with {{parasitic}} worms (e. g., Schistosoma mansoni, hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, and <b>threadworm)</b> {{are still}} {{widespread in the}} developing world. Accurate diagnosis is important for better patient management and for monitoring of deworming programs. Unfortunately, methods to detect parasite eggs or larvae in stool samples lack sensitivity, particularly when infection intensities are low. The most widely used method for the diagnosis of S. mansoni, hookworm, roundworm and whipworm in epidemiological surveys is the Kato-Katz technique. Recently, the FLOTAC technique has shown a higher sensitivity than the Kato-Katz method for the diagnosis of hookworm, roundworm and whipworm, but no data are available for S. mansoni. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of the FLOTAC with the Kato-Katz, ether-concentration and Koga agar plate techniques for S. mansoni and other parasitic worm infections using stool samples from 112 school children from Côte d'Ivoire. FLOTAC showed the highest sensitivity for S. mansoni diagnosis. Egg counts, however, were lower when using FLOTAC, an issue which needs further investigations. The FLOTAC, Kato-Katz and ether-concentration techniques failed to accurately detect <b>threadworm</b> larvae, and hence, the Koga agar plate remains the method of choice for this neglected parasite...|$|E
