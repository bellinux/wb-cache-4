The most commonly known subcooling is the condenser subcooling, which is usually known as the <b>total</b> <b>temperature</b> drop that takes place inside the condenser, immediately after the fluid has totally condensed, until it leaves the condensing unit.|$|E

50|$|The {{complete}} {{channel configuration}} {{consists of a}} condenser channel with inlet and outlet and an evaporator channel with inlet and outlet. These two channels are separated by the hydrophobic, micro porous membrane. For cooling, the condenser channel is flooded with fresh water and the evaporator e.g. with salty feed water. The coolant enters the condenser channel at a temperature of 20 °C. After passing through the membrane, the vapour condenses in the cooling water, releasing its latent heat and leading to a temperature increase in the coolant. Sensible heat conduction also heats the cooling water through {{the surface of the}} membrane. Due to the mass transport through the membrane the mass flow in the evaporator decreases whilst the condenser channel increases by the same amount. The mass flow of pre-heated coolant leaves the condenser channel at a temperature of about 72 °C and enters a heat exchanger, thus pre-heating the feed water. This feed water is then delivered to a further heat source and finally enters the evaporator channel of the MD module at a temperature of 80 °C. The evaporation process extracts latent heat from the feed flow, which cools down the feed increasingly in flow direction. Additional heat reduction occurs due to sensible heat passing through the membrane. The cooled feed water leaves the evaporator channel at approximately 28 °C. <b>Total</b> <b>temperature</b> differences between condenser inlet and evaporator outlet and condenser inlet and evaporator outlet are about equal. In a PGMD module, the permeate channel is separated from the condenser channel by a condensation surface. This enables the direct use of a salt water feed as coolant, since it does not come into contact with the permeate. Considering this, the cooling-or feed water entering the condenser channel at a temperature T1 can now also be used to cool the permeate. Condensation of vapour takes place inside the liquid permeate. Pre-heated feed water that was used to cool the condenser can be conducted directly to a heat source for final heating, after leaving the condenser at a temperature T2. After it has reached temperature T3 it is guided into the evaporator. Permeate is extracted at temperature T5 and the cooled brine is discharged at temperature T4.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported herein was to explore {{the use of a}} continuous operation plasma torch as an ignitor and flameholder for scramjet combustion. This research was motivated by the desire to eliminate the use of pyrophoric or toxic ignition and/or combustion enhancement materials in operational aircraft or shipboard systems. The <b>total</b> <b>temperatures</b> and torch powers used to ignite/flamehold Mach 2 combustion with hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, and methane were determined. The minimum ignition <b>total</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the fuels tested were hydrogen - 1065 R (lowest test temperature); ethylene - 1500 R; ethane - 2000 R; methane - 2700 R. These temperatures were obtained while operating the torch at a nominal 2 kw net power. The torch was shown to be a good ignitor and flameholder in that both hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels could be stabilized by the torch and would 'blow off' when the torch was extinguished. The effectiveness of the torch was very sensitive to relative fuel injection location. Best combustion resulted when fuel was injected both upstream and downstream of the torch. These results indicated that an adiabatic plasma torch operating at about 2 kw could be an effective ignitor and flameholder for high-speed combustion...|$|R
