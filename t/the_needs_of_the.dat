5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust, with other landowners, attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation, whilst protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors themselves. An inevitable tension exists between <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many {{millions of people who}} visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E

Quickly learning the language and customs of this group of some 200,000 men, Harrison successfully treated many bilharzia, catarrh and tuberculosis cases, significantly {{reducing the number of}} sick members of the Corps during the winter of 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Canadian Pacific Railway officials, Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney {{made the decision}} to move the capital to Regina, also in present-day Saskatchewan, in June 1882. The decision to move the capital was controversial with the public because Edgar Dewdney owned real estate in Regina. He was accused of having conflicted interests between his private affairs and <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth.

5|$|Despite the project's termination, the two {{companies}} continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E

Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E

5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance.

Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province.
