It is concluded that the exercises and topics covered in <b>the</b> <b>practicals</b> coincide with <b>the</b> Physiology content corresponding to Morphophysiology I, III, V and VI and that they can be carried out with the existing resources as well as other innovated by the authors. This way of proceeding saves resources by replacing media or reagents and leads to more effective learning, plus better preparation of teachers to meet the challenges posed by the curriculum D...|$|R

40|$|Although {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{are the most}} common reason for general practitioner visits, training did not keep pace. Implementation of learning from patients with rheumatologic disorders linked together with the teaching of theoretical knowledge in the preclinical medical education might be an important step forward in the improvement of quality of care for these patients. The Leiden Medical School curriculum has implemented two non-obligatory real patient learning (RPL) <b>practicals</b> integrated within <b>the</b> preclinical block {{musculoskeletal disorders}}. This study investigates the educational effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>practicals,</b> <b>the</b> expectations students have of RPL, and students’ satisfaction. Participants’ grades on the end-of-block test served as the test results of the educational effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>practicals</b> and were compared with those of the non-participants. Qualitative data was collected by means of questionnaires generated by focus groups. <b>The</b> participants in <b>practicals</b> scored significantly higher at the end-of-block test. The expected effects of the contact with real patients concerned positive effects on cognition and skills. ‘Contextualizing of the theory’, ‘better memorizing of clinical pictures’, and ‘understanding {{of the impact of the}} disease’ were the most frequently mentioned effects of <b>the</b> <b>practicals.</b> Overall, <b>the</b> participants were (very) enthusiastic about this educational format. <b>The</b> RPL <b>practicals</b> integrated within a preclinical block musculoskeletal disorders are a valuable addition to the Leiden medical curriculum. This relatively limited intervention exhibits a strong effect on students’ performance in tests. Future research should be directed towards the long-term effects of this intervention...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{implemented}} robot <b>practicals</b> were {{specifically designed}} to increase student engagement and motivation in electronics <b>practicals</b> while maintaining <b>the</b> same learning outcomes. Design based learning is self-directed where students initiate learning by designing innovative and creative solutions to fulfil both industry and academic requirements. The use of <b>the</b> robot <b>practicals</b> aligns with features of the DBL educational model. DESIGN/METHOD <b>The</b> robot <b>practicals</b> were designed to simultaneously increase student engagement and to improve the learning experience for students studying both Electronics related and non-Electronics related disciplines (such as Mechanical and Civil Engineering). An evaluation study was performed to determine the student perceived effectiveness of the approach in improving student engagement.
