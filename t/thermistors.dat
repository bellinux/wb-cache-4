25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the <b>thermistor</b> to its surroundings. It is generally given for the <b>thermistor</b> in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass bead <b>thermistor</b> are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a <b>thermistor</b> may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the <b>thermistor</b> may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the <b>thermistor.</b>|$|R
50|$|An NTC <b>thermistor's</b> {{resistance}} is high at low temperatures. When the circuit is closed, the <b>thermistor's</b> resistance limits the initial current. After some time current flow heats the <b>thermistor,</b> and its resistance changes {{to a lower}} value, allowing current to flow uninterrupted. It is inherently impossible for 100% of supply voltage {{to appear on the}} protected circuit, as the <b>thermistor</b> must continue to dissipate power (producing heat) in order to maintain a low resistance. The resulting voltage drop from the operating resistance, and the power consumption of the <b>thermistor</b> must be taken into account.|$|R

25|$|Because early <b>thermistors</b> were {{difficult}} to produce and applications for the technology were limited, commercial production of <b>thermistors</b> did not begin until the 1930s. A commercially viable thermistor was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermistors</b> {{differ from}} {{resistance}} temperature detectors (RTDs) {{in that the}} material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while <b>thermistors</b> typically achieve a greater precision within a limited temperature range, typically −90°C to 130°C.|$|E
40|$|The DAYton {{temperature}} CORrection model (DAYCOR) calculates {{the temperature}} correction {{that must be}} applied to the temperature measured by the VIZ radiosonde`s white rod <b>thermistor</b> to deduce the atmospheric temperature. The temperature correction calculation takes into account all the significant heat transfer processes that influence the temperature of the rod <b>thermistor.</b> These processes include the convective heat transfer with the air, the solar and infrared radiation absorbed by the <b>thermistor,</b> the radiation emitted by the <b>thermistor,</b> and the heat conducted to the <b>thermistor</b> through the lead wires. The DAYCOR model ignores the influence, on the <b>thermistor,</b> of reflected and emitted radiation from the balloon and radiosonde instrument. Luers`(1989) shows these influences to contribute less than 10 % to the temperature correction. The heating of the <b>thermistor</b> from the electric current passing through the circuit is small and is also neglected in the model calculations...|$|R

This paper describes a log-antilog analog control circuit capable of monitoring a <b>thermistor's</b> internal temperature in both ambient temperature sensing mode and self-heating mode, while maintaining infinite precision, wide dynamic range and fast sensor response. A single self-referencing <b>thermistor</b> is used to avoid {{the problems associated with}} having to match a <b>thermistor</b> pair in order to obtain an over-temperature signal.

30|$|It is {{possible}} to fabricate highly sensitive NTCR (negative {{temperature coefficient of resistance}}) <b>thermistor</b> using nano crystalline CaTiO 3 synthesized by high energy ball milling. Disc shaped green pellets were prepared and effects of sintering on the disc pellets were studied as <b>thermistor</b> by sintering the samples at 1000 °C, 1100 °C and 1200 °C. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), impedance analysis and electrical measurement. The resistivity of the prepared samples varies predictably with temperature: this makes them promising material for temperature sensor. The experimental results prove that nano crystalline CaTiO 3 ceramic is one kind of <b>thermistor</b> with exponential negative temperature coefficient of resistance in the temperature range of 300 – 500 °C. The samples have the advantages of rapid response, high sensitivity and capability to withstand thermal surges over the temperature range of 300 – 500 °C. Resistance-temperature characteristics are described by <b>thermistor</b> equation with <b>thermistor</b> constant around 4003 K to 10795 K and thermal coefficient of resistance α around ∼ 1 %/°C to ∼ 13 %/°C. The activation energy is in the range of 0.34 – 0.93 eV. The observed <b>thermistor</b> parameters are found to be comparable with many of the known <b>thermistor</b> materials.

25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. <b>Thermistors</b> are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|Many {{electric}} motors and dry type power transformers incorporate PTC <b>thermistors</b> in their windings. When {{used in conjunction}} with a monitoring relay they provide overtemperature protection to prevent insulation damage. The equipment manufacturer selects a thermistor with a highly non-linear response curve where resistance increases dramatically at the maximum allowable winding temperature, causing the relay to operate.|$|E
25|$|Thermocouples are {{suitable}} for measuring over a large temperature range, from −270 up to 3000°C (for a short time, in inert atmosphere). Applications include temperature measurement for kilns, gas turbine exhaust, diesel engines, other industrial processes and fog machines. They are less suitable for applications where smaller temperature differences need to be measured with high accuracy, for example the range 0–100°C with 0.1°C accuracy. For such applications <b>thermistors,</b> silicon bandgap temperature sensors and resistance thermometers are more suitable.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} devices whose {{resistance}} changes with various quantities. The resistance of NTC <b>thermistors</b> exhibit a strong negative temperature coefficient, making them useful for measuring temperatures. Since their resistance can be large {{until they are}} allowed to heat up due to the passage of current, they are also commonly used to prevent excessive current surges when equipment is powered on. Similarly, the resistance of a humistor varies with humidity. One sort of photodetector, the photoresistor, has a resistance which varies with illumination.|$|E

25|$|Resistance {{thermometers}} and <b>thermistors</b> {{are generally}} used in two ways. First, {{they can be}} used as thermometers: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, {{they can be used}} in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components {{can be used in a}} circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a nonlinear and hysteretic circuit element. For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.|$|E
