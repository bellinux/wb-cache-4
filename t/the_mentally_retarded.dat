500|$|Scalia {{believed}} {{that the death penalty}} is constitutional. He dissented in decisions that hold the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups, such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense. In Thompson v. Oklahoma (1988), he dissented from the Court's ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 {{at the time of the}} offense, and the following year authored the Court's opinion in Stanford v. Kentucky, sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16. However, in 2005, the Court overturned Stanford in Roper v. Simmons, and Scalia again dissented, mocking the majority's claims that a national consensus had emerged against the execution of those who killed while underage, noting that less than half of the states that permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers. He castigated the majority for including in their count states that had abolished the death penalty entirely, stating that doing so was [...] "rather like including old-order Amishmen in a consumer-preference poll on the electric car. Of course they don't like it, but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue". In 2002, in Atkins v. Virginia, the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded.</b> Scalia dissented, stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute the mildly mentally retarded at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights and that the Court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against the practice.|$|E

2500|$|The Court then {{described}} how a national consensus that <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> {{should not be}} executed had emerged. In 1986, Georgia was {{the first state to}} outlaw the execution of <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded.</b> Congress followed two years later, and the next year Maryland joined these two jurisdictions. Thus, when the Court confronted the issue in Penry in 1989, the Court could not say that a national consensus against executing <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> had emerged. Over the next twelve years, nineteen more states exempted <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> from capital punishment under their laws, bringing the total number of states to twenty-one, plus the federal government. While there are 50 states, 19 don't allow the death penalty under any circumstance, making 21 out of 31 a clear majority of the death penalty states. In light of the [...] "consistency of direction of change" [...] toward a prohibition on the execution of <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded,</b> and the relative rarity of such executions in states that still allow it, the Court proclaimed that a [...] "national consensus has developed against it." [...] The Court, however, left it to individual states to make the difficult decision regarding what determines mental retardation.|$|E
2500|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> are {{not able}} to {{communicate}} with the same sophistication as the average offender, there is a greater likelihood that their deficiency in communicative ability will be interpreted by juries as a lack of remorse for their crimes. They typically make poor witnesses, being more prone to suggestion and willing to [...] "confess" [...] in order to placate or please their questioner. Thus, there is a greater risk that the jury may impose the death penalty despite the existence of evidence that suggests that a lesser penalty should be imposed. In light of the [...] "evolving standards of decency" [...] that the Eighth Amendment demands, the fact that the goals of retribution and deterrence are not served as well in the execution of <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded,</b> and the heightened risk that the death penalty will be imposed erroneously, the Court concluded that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to determine the level of priority of importance of administrative problem areas and specific problem items preventing the implementation of special programs for <b>the</b> educable <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> in Utah. <b>The</b> study was conducted using a survey of twenty-seven school districts in the state of Utah lacking a sequential program for <b>the</b> educable <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> in grades one through six. A questionnaire was sent to 184 selected respondents, including school board chairmen, superintendents, and elementary principals. Responses were received from 92 percent of the original selection. The respondent was asked to rank each of the problem items according to one of five choices, major, moderate, average, minor, or no problem to implementation. Results were evaluated on the basis of agreement among the rankings of the respondents, the relationship of the rankings, priority of the administrative areas, priority of the problem items, and individual group rankings. Statistical treatment revealed significance at the. 01 level for the level of agreement and relationship among the rankings of the administrative problem areas. Further treatment revealed the priority of administrative problem categories in order of major importance to be: (1) professional personnel, (2) pupil personnel; (3) supervision, (4) communications, (5) research, (6) finance, and (7) policy. Individual problem items used in the questionnaire were ranked by priority of importance as perceived by the respondents as a combined group as well as by individual groups. There were sixty-two problem items ranked in order of priority. The conclusions arrived at {{as a result of the}} analysis of the data included: (1) there was a high level of agreement among the perceptions of the administrators in ranking the importance of the problem areas and specific items, (2) the respondents as individual and combined groups perceived the category of obtaining and retaining qualified professional personnel as the major problem to implementation of the special program, (3) the individual problem of greatest concern was the obtaining of a qualified classroom teacher for <b>the</b> educable <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded,</b> (4) communications are needed to inform the parents, public, and school faculty to gain support for t he educational needs of <b>the</b> educable <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded,</b> (5) administrators recognize the need for early identification of the potential retardate, accurate diagnosis and educational placement as important to program implementation, and (6) it appeared that present school policies are adequate in meeting the needs of program implementation of <b>the</b> educable <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Thomas {{rejected}} Breyer‚Äôs {{example of}} a double murderer arbitrarily receiving a lighter sentence than a murderer, citing news reports on WRAL-TV as explanation. [...] Noting that, ‚Äúin my decades on the Court, I have not seen a capital crime {{that could not be}} considered sufficiently ‚Äòblameworthy‚Äô to merit a death sentence‚Äù, Thomas concluded by spending several pages graphically describing some of those crimes, including several rapes and several murders committed by <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> and by juveniles.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the [...] "relationship between mental {{retardation}} and the penological purposes {{served by the}} death penalty" [...] justifies a conclusion that executing <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> is {{cruel and unusual punishment}} that the Eighth Amendment should forbid. In other words, unless it can be shown that executing <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> promotes the goals of retribution and deterrence, doing so is nothing more than [...] "purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering", making the death penalty cruel and unusual in those cases. Being mentally retarded means that a person not only has substandard intellectual functioning but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction. These deficiencies typically manifest before the age of eighteen. Although they can know {{the difference between right and}} wrong, these deficiencies mean they have a lesser ability to learn from experience, engage in logical reasoning, and understand the reactions of others. This means that inflicting the death penalty on one mentally retarded individual is less likely to deter other mentally retarded individuals from committing crimes. As for retribution, society's interest in seeing that a criminal get his [...] "just desserts" [...] means that the death penalty must be confined to the [...] "most serious" [...] of murders, not simply the average murder. The goal of retribution is not served by imposing the death penalty on a group of people who have a significantly lesser capacity to understand why they are being executed.|$|E
