5|$|The prince was {{plunged into}} debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, {{forcing him to}} quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the prince's {{political}} allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The prince's relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the prince's authority, the Whig leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny. Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, <b>to</b> <b>restate</b> Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the prince £161,000 (equivalent to £ today) to pay his debts and £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) for improvements to Carlton House.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist {{point of view of a}} male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope <b>to</b> <b>restate</b> the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Goren was sharply {{criticized by}} the Israeli Defense Ministry, who, noting Goren's senior rank, called his {{behavior}} inappropriate. The episode led the Chief Rabbis of the time <b>to</b> <b>restate</b> the accepted laws of Judaism that no Jews were allowed on the mount due to issues of ritual impurity. The secular authorities welcomed this ruling as it preserved the status quo with the Waqf, the Islamic authority.

25|$|Neo-creationism is a pseudoscientific {{movement}} {{which aims}} <b>to</b> <b>restate</b> creationism in terms {{more likely to}} be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the scientific community. It aims to re-frame the debate over the origins of life in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture.

Aguillard that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on Harrison's otherwise self-produced 1973 album has confused some critics and reviewers. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden noted: [...] "This {{was considered an}} underhand trick in some quarters. However, since the single had clearly not received the attention it merited, {{it could be argued}} that George was simply husbanding his resources carefully." [...] On release, in an otherwise highly favourable review for Material World, Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "an overblown attempt <b>to</b> <b>restate</b> the [...] spiritual message in material terms: 'Won't you try some / Baby won't you buy some.'" [...] In Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote that the song fitted the album-wide description of Harrison's personal journey to [...] "musical iconographer" [...] status from his Beatle past.

40|$|It is contended {{early in}} this book that many {{accounting}} students dislike theory, {{but it is also}} asserted that for practice to be effective it must be reasoned practice. Theory provides this reasoning. However, in the past most accounting theory books have fallen well short of presenting a coherent explanation of the basis for theory and its relation to accounting practice. Some have simply described current research trends; some have described existing practices as if their mere existence was reason enough for their continued use; while others have deferred <b>to</b> <b>restating</b> current regulations with the implication that they were the theory of accounting! As the title implies, this book links theory to research and practice and indicates where regulation is necessary to substitute for independently derived theory...|$|R
