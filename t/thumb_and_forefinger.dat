5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Gleason was {{initially}} exempt from military service, {{since he was}} a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed {{at the end of his}} coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F, and rejected for military service.|$|E

25|$|Entwistle's playing {{technique}} incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, {{and the use}} of harmonics. He {{changed his}} style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioning his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> {{with the rest of his}} fingers outstretched for balance.|$|E
25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} pane of glass. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom {{on either side of}} the nose, into which the diver can insert a <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|A sling {{has a small}} cradle or pouch in {{the middle}} of two lengths of cord. The sling stone is placed in the pouch. The middle finger or thumb is placed through a loop on the end of one cord, and a tab {{at the end of the}} other cord is placed between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger.</b> The sling is swung in an arc, and the tab {{released}} at a precise moment. This frees the projectile to fly to the target. The sling essentially works by extending the length of a human arm, thus allowing stones to be thrown much farther than they could be by hand.|$|E
5000|$|A simple opener is a {{piece of}} metal with a {{rectangular}} or rounded opening in one end and a solid handle large enough to be gripped between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> on the other. The opening contains a lip that is placed under the edge of the bottle top, pulling it off when upward force is applied to the handle end of the opener. This type of opener is small and durable, so it is frequently used as a key fob.|$|R

His grave has a sculpture of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> of two hands forming an oblong space—the classic view as if through a movie camera. The small sculpture is in black marble on a pedestal slightly over a metre tall. The slab with Kieślowski's name and dates lies below.|$|R
50|$|Seperewa can {{be played}} in {{different}} positions. The player can play while sitting down with the instrument resting on his lap, with {{the neck of the}} instrument standing upright. He may also play while standing, the instrument held firmly in the groin to gain enough support, the neck facing perpendicular in the same direction. Strumming and plucking are the two basic techniques applied and these are done by the <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> with some occasional assistance from the middle fingers. The Seprewa player can even dance while he is playing or make some dramatic movements.|$|R
25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, {{a policy}} {{similar to the}} Navy's Press Gangs was introduced. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impressment of individuals. For some men {{this would have been}} for being drunk and disorderly. The chief {{advantages}} of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> of the right hand. Both acts were repealed in 1780. The British Government also released criminals and debtors from prison on the condition they joined the army. Three entire regiments during the American Revolution were raised from this early release programme. Of the Volunteer recruits, some would find they had been enticed to take the King's shilling under false pretenses and many men would find they had signed to a lifetime in the army.|$|E
25|$|In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of {{gripping}} {{the blade of}} their knife between <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing their hand from handle {{to the tip of}} the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.|$|E
25|$|The flipper is bowled on the {{opposite}} side to a slider, much {{in the same way that}} the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart a good helping of backspin or underspin. In doing so the flipper will float on towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or underspin will cause the ball to hurry on at great pace with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on to either hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.|$|E

30|$|Peduncle length was {{measured}} from the panicle node {{to the one}} immediately below it in all four treatments in both experiments 2 and 3. Rice panicles do not completely exsert during water-deficit stress. Hence, the number of spikelets {{within and outside the}} flag-leaf sheath was counted from all four treatments for both experiments 2 and 3. Seed-set of spikelets inside and outside the leaf sheath was recorded by pressing each of them between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>forefinger</b> to determine whether the grain was filled or not.|$|R
50|$|Teks or teks game cards (lit. texted game cards): Filipino {{children}} collect these {{playing cards}} which contain comic strips and texts placed within speech balloons. They are played by tossing {{them to the}} air until the cards hit the ground. The cards are flipped upwards through the air using the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>forefinger</b> which creates a snapping sound as the nail of the thumb hits {{the surface of the}} card. The winner or gainer collect the other players' card depending on how the cards are laid out upon hitting or landing on the ground.|$|R

60|$|The {{offices of}} Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs stood convenient, {{with an open}} door down two smooth steps, in the market-place; so that any angry farmer inclining towards hot water, might tumble into it at once. Their special council-chamber and hall of conference was an old back-room up-stairs, with a low dark ceiling, {{which seemed to be}} {{knitting}} its brows gloomily in the consideration of tangled points of law. It was furnished with some high-backed leathern chairs, garnished with great goggle-eyed brass nails, of which, every here and there, two or three had fallen out - or had been picked out, perhaps, by the wandering <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> of bewildered clients. There was a framed print of a great judge in it, every curl in whose dreadful wig had made a man's hair stand on end. Bales of papers filled the dusty closets, shelves, and tables; and round the wainscot there were tiers of boxes, padlocked and fireproof, with people's names painted outside, which anxious visitors felt themselves, by a cruel enchantment, obliged to spell backwards and forwards, and to make anagrams of, while they sat, seeming to listen to Snitchey and Craggs, without comprehending one word of what they said.|$|R

The critical parts [...] of his Life of Dryden seem to me {{the best of his}} writing in this [...] kind. There is little to be gleaned after him. He had studied his [...] author, which he seldom did, and his criticism is sympathetic, a [...] thing still rarer with him.

5000|$|Gestures, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "body language," [...] {{play an important role in}} industry. Proper body language etiquette in business dealings can be crucial for success. However, gestures can have different meanings according to the country in which they are expressed. In an age of global business, diplomatic cultural sensitivity has become a necessity. Gestures that we take as innocent may be seen by someone else as deeply insulting. [...] The following gestures are examples of proper etiquette with respect to different countries’ customs on salutations:In the United States, [...] "a firm handshake, accompanied by direct eye contact, is the standard greeting. Direct eye contact in both social and business situations is very important."In the People's Republic of China, [...] "the Western custom of shaking a person's hand upon introduction has become widespread throughout the country. However, oftentimes a nod of the head or a slight bow will suffice."In Japan, [...] "the act of presenting business cards is very important. When presenting, one holds the business card with both hands, grasping it between the <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefingers.</b> The presentation is to be accompanied by a slight bow. The print on the card should point towards the person to which one is giving the card."In Germany, [...] "it is impolite to shake someone's hand with your other hand in your pocket. This is seen as a sign of disrespect"In France, [...] "a light, quick handshake is common. To offer a strong, pumping handshake would be considered uncultured. When one enters a room, be sure to greet each person present. A woman in France will offer her hand first." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{plectrum}} banjo is {{a standard}} banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as [...] "Chicago tuning." [...] As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style pick (that is, a single one held between <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>forefinger),</b> unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a thumbpick and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, {{to confirm}} {{theories}} {{as to how}} ancient mariners managed long sea journeys before sophisticated instruments were developed, Explorer Marvin Creamer commissioned [...] "NavStar", a Southern Cross 39. Marvin, a Geography professor at Glassboro State (now Rowan University) would navigate by the Stars! NavStar! No sextant or compass would guide him on his long journey — only stars, winds, water currents and occasional signs of life. In 1980, Marvin successfully completed his historic trans-Atlantic voyage with no navigational instruments, just a <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> a <b>forefinger,</b> confirming his theory. Creamer sailed from New Jersey to Dakar, Africa. His return trip, via the Cape Verde Islands and Bermuda, was also {{without the use of}} traditional navigational instruments. By early '84, Creamer had made eight Atlantic crossings, three times without navigation instruments, not even a compass or clock.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} protocol included three phases. In the first one, approx. 5  min, {{the organization and}} {{the scope of the}} test were explained to the volunteers (e.g. expected actions from their side, how to place the hand on the sensor, how to regulate the seat position). In the second phase each volunteer regulated the height of the seat to simulate the relative seat-handlebar position they are used to while riding and lastly they placed their hand on the sensor as explained in the previous phase. To facilitate the hand positioning a replication of the active area and of the active cells composing the sensor matrix was attached to the sensor. Volunteers had to place the hand on the sensor leaving the same number of free cells on both sides and the middle point between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>forefinger</b> joints on the red line. The third phase included the tests and related data acquisition.|$|R
