The {{important point is that}} Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a band {{if it were not for}} The Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never thinks of saying anything else. False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when we come to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|E

Sleep dentistry is a common term once used to describe a visit to the dentist. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> though it was referred to as sleep dentistry, the patient never actually went to sleep during the visit.

50|$|The Third Amanda's {{support for}} Hal Mayne {{is part of}} another trilogy of {{characters}} that combine the three parts of humanity as Gordon R. Dickson envisions. She is the strength, the courage, and the competence that compliments the other two muses in his life. Rukh Tamani, who embodies Faith, and Ajela who embodies Understanding being these other two components based on the Childe Cycle splinter cultures. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{each of these three}} characters embodies all three of the important philosophies: Courage, Faith, Understanding. The only difference is their emphasis of one over the other two. The Third Amanda certainly possesses both Faith and Understanding, but it is her Courage and Personal Responsibility that are paramount to her character.|$|E

He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've seen it all.

I think also it’s kind of a testament to her influence as kind of inspiration for new generations of designers,” observed Alexander Fury of The Independent, “She said when she relaunched the label in the 90’s that she was dressing women and they were having the same reaction as the women had in the 70’s.

50|$|Chanson themes {{vary greatly}} {{depending}} on the time in which the songs were written and the places {{in which they are}} set. For example, songs set in the Odessa of the 1910s tend to be more cheerful, and are sharply contrasted by the dark, depressing, and violent songs set in the Stalinist era. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is common for a Chanson artist, regardless of the time in which he writes his songs, to include songs of all periods in his repertoire, and write songs set in an era different from his own. This often leads to confusion: for example, the bard Alexander Gorodnitsky reports being beaten up once after claiming authorship to one of his songs, which was attributed to a Gulag inmate living over 30 years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} the album's sound and genre, Church {{emphasized}} {{that he does not}} define his music by genre, calling it an [...] "outdated concept."

[...] According to CMT, Church goes further to say [...] "I think genres are dead. There's good music. There's bad music.

Thankamany town is located in a valley of three small hills Thamprankunnu, Kattadikavala and Kurishupara respectively.

The announcement for separation occurred just before the appearance of the disease and along with this came the suspicion that the separation was done on purpose by Serbians to prepare for poisoning. The [...] "reform" [...] had not been expanded everywhere, when the poisoning began. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> absence of Serbian students that particular day. The segregation was classified as an attempt to form a kind of an apartheid society in Kosovo. In this case it was accomplished despite poisoning.|$|R

5000|$|According to Hugh Nibley, {{the proverbial}} {{ancestor}} of the Arabs is Ishmael. His name {{is one of}} the few Old Testament names which is also at home in ancient Arabia: [...] "Thus in Lehi's friend [...] "Ishmael" [...] (1 Nephi 7:2) we surely have a man of the desert. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nephi takes Ishmael (unlike Zoram) completely for granted, never explaining who he is or how he fits into the picture--the act of sending for him seems to be the most natural thing in the world, as does the marriage of his daughters with Lehi's sons. Since it has ever been the custom among the desert people for a man to marry the daughter of his paternal uncle (bint 'ammi), it is hard to avoid the impression that Lehi and Ishmael were related. There is a remarkable association between the names of Lehi and Ishmael which ties them both to the southern desert, where the legendary birthplace and central shrine of Ishmael was at a place called Be'er Lehai-ro'i." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{scholarship}} enabled Kalecki {{to travel}} with his wife to Sweden, where the followers of Knut Wicksell were trying to formalize a theory similar to Kalecki's. At about that time he learnt of the publication of Keynes's General Theory. This was most likely his motive for traveling to England. He first visited the London School of Economics and afterward went to Cambridge. Thus began his friendships with Richard Kahn, Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa, which left an indelible mark on all of them. In 1937 Kalecki met Keynes. The meeting was cool and Keynes kept aloof. Although the conclusions they had arrived at in their respective works were very similar, their characters {{could not have been}} more different. Kalecki graciously neglected to mention that he enjoyed a priority of publication. As Joan Robinson stated: [...] "Michal Kalecki's claim to priority of publication is indisputable. With proper scholarly dignity (which, however, is unfortunately rather rare among scholars) he never mentioned this fact. And, indeed, except for the authors concerned, it is not particularly interesting to know who first got into print. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> two thinkers, from completely different political and intellectual starting points, should come to the same conclusion.

It's not yet clear whether Eve Myles as new Torchwood recruit PC Gwen Cooper can fill Billie Piper's boots. Surely not—those boots are two gaping weekend voids that no one can fill.

5000|$|From around 1933 to 1977 Thom {{spent most}} of his {{weekends}} and holiday periods hefting theodolites and survey equipment around the countryside with his family member or friends, most notably with his son Archie. From studies measuring and analysing the data created at over five hundred megalithic sites, he attempted to classify stone circles into different morphological types, Type A, Type B, Type B modified and Type D flattened circles, Type 1 and Type 2 eggs, ovals and true circles. He suggested several were built as astronomical complexes to predict eclipses via nineteen-year cycles. Thom went on to identify numerous solar and stellar alignments at stone circles, providing the foundations for the scientific discipline of Archaeoastronomy. He further suggested the prehistoric peoples of Britain must have used a solar method of keeping calendar. Based on statistical histograms of observed declinations at horizon marks with no convenient star at −22°, +8°, +9° and +22° (except possibly Spica at +9°) between 2100 and 1600 BC, he suggested a year based on sixteen months; four with twenty two days, eleven with twenty three days and one with twenty four. Thom's suggested megalithic solar year was divided by midsummer, midwinter and the two equinoxes into four and then subdivided into eight by early versions of the modern Christian festivals of Whitsun, Lammas, Martinmas and Candlemas (see Scottish Quarter Days). He found little evidence for further subdivision into thirty two, but noted [...] "We do not know how sophisticated prehistoric man's calendar was, but <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he obtained declinations very close to those we have obtained as ideal". Thom explored these topics further in his later books, Megalithic sites in Britain (Oxford, 1967), Megalithic lunar observatories (Oxford, 1971) and Megalithic Remains in Britain and Brittany (Oxford, 1978), the last written with his son Archie after they carried out a detailed survey of the Carnac stones from 1970 to 1974.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{follows a}} dinner party given by Bertha Young and her husband Harry. The writing shows Bertha {{depicted}} as a happy soul, though quite naive about the world she lives in and those closest to her. The story opened {{up a lot of}} questions, about deceit, about knowing oneself and also about the possibility of homosexuality {{at the start of the}} 20th century. The story gives us a bird's eye view of the dinner party, which is attended by a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Knight, who are close friends to Bertha and Harry. Guest, Eddie Warren, is an effeminate character, who adds an interesting mix to the party. The only other guest, Pearl Fulton, is someone who Bertha is mysteriously drawn to for reasons unknown to her at the start. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Bertha's husband is presented to the reader as Bertha perceives him in her mind. Because Bertha is so naive, the reader first gets the impression that Harry is a crude, disinterested person who has a strong dislike for Pearl by his conversational tone and curtness towards her as the conversation unfolds. As the dinner party progresses, Bertha questions her own interest and fascination towards Pearl. The fact that Eddie, who is most likely homosexual, is present, lends an air to the possibility that Bertha's interest in Pearl is more than a platonic feeling one has towards a friend of the same sex. It is only after Bertha analyzes her feelings towards Pearl that she realizes that the connection she feels with Pearl is their mutual attraction for Harry, and coming out of her [...] "blissful" [...] reverie she makes the discovery that Harry and Pearl are having an affair. The title to this story alludes to the sentiment that ignorance is bliss. The story leaves the question about whether it is best to live blissfully ignorant of the truth or live with the knowledge of a harsh reality.|$|E
