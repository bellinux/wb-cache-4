40|$|The simple {{structure}} of the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), a phenol and an imidazolone ring linked by a methyne bridge, supports an exceptionally diverse range of excited state phenomena. Here we describe experimentally and theoretically the photochemistry of a novel sterically crowded nonplanar derivative of the GFP chromophore. It undergoes an excited state isomerization reaction accompanied by an exceptionally fast (sub 100 fs) excited state decay. The decay dynamics are essentially independent of solvent polarity and viscosity. Excited state structural dynamics are probed by high level quantum chemical calculations revealing that the fast decay {{is due to a}} conical intersection characterized by a twist of the rings and pyramidalization of the methyne bridge carbon. The intersection can be accessed without a barrier from the pre-twisted Franck-Condon structure, and the lack of viscosity dependence {{is due to the fact}} that the rings twist in the same direction, giving rise to a volume-conserving decay coordinate. Moreover, the rotation of the phenyl, methyl and imidazolone groups are coupled in the sterically crowded structure, with the methyl group translating the rotation of one ring to the next. As a consequence, the excited state dynamics can be viewed as a <b>torsional</b> <b>couple,</b> where the absorbed photon energy leads to conversion of the out-of-plane orientation from one ring to the other in a volume conserving fashion. A similar modification of the range of methyne dyes may provide a new family of devices for molecular machines, specifically <b>torsional</b> <b>couples...</b>|$|R

In the previous study, the causes of moan noise were identified, and a coherence analysis of the components was conducted.

40|$|A passive auto-tuning {{mass damper}} (PATMD) is a {{vibration}} control device {{that consists of}} a mass which is suspended in the top region of a structure and is forced into motion, due to inertia, when the structure is excited.

The PATMD is connected to the structure to be controlled by a group of inelastic ropes and is free to move in any translational direction. It moves relative to the structure, utilising and dissipating large amounts of energy as it swings from side to side, and in this way, the vibrational energy of the structure is absorbed and consequently the vibrations of the structure are controlled. First, the ‘PATMD efficiency tests’ are carried out, whereby the test model is subjected to translational, <b>torsional</b> and <b>coupled</b> free vibration tests, initially without the PATMD and then with the PATMD, {{in order to determine the}} damping effects of the PATMD. The test model is then subjected to forced harmonic vibration tests similar to those described above and the damping effects are again analysed.
