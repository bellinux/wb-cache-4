This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E

However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight <b>time</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{numerical}} technique for solving Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, based on spectral Fourier methods. This equation describes reaction diffusion problems, and the dynamics of viscous-fuid films flowing along walls. After we wrote the equation in Fourier space, we get a system. In this case, the exponential <b>time</b> <b>differencing</b> methods integrate the system very much more accurately than other methods since the exponential <b>time</b> <b>differencing</b> methods assume in their derivation that the solution varies slowly in time.

This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board.

5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the {{response}} is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg in one hour, five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E
40|$|Parameters {{describing}} intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> {{are increasingly}} assessed in both adults and children. However, {{to appreciate the}} implications of these parameters in children, knowledge of the applicability of adult techniques in children is essential. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the applicability of speckle-tracking strain-derived parameters in children, paying special attention to age and heart rate dependency. One hundred eighty-three healthy subjects (aged 0 - 19 years) were included. Left ventricular global peak strain, time to global peak strain, and parameters describing intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> were assessed using speckle-tracking strain imaging in the apical two-chamber, three-chamber, and four-chamber views (longitudinal strain) and the parasternal short-axis view (radial and circumferential strain). Parameters describing intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> included the standard deviation of time to peak strain and <b>differences</b> in <b>time</b> to peak strain between two specified segments. Age and heart rate dependency were evaluated using regression analysis, and intraobserver and interobserver variability were tested. Acquisition and analysis of longitudinal six-segment time-strain curves was successful in 94. 8 % of subjects and radial and circumferential time-strain curves in 89. 5 %. No clinically significant linear relation was observed between age or heart rate and parameters describing intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences.</b> The coefficient of variation of time to global peak strain parameters was 10 for parameters describing intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences.</b> The feasibility of speckle-tracking strain analysis in children is relatively good. Furthermore, no linear relation was observed between age or heart rate and parameters describing intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences.</b> However, the limited reproducibility of some parameters describing intraventricular <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> will confine their applicability in clinical practic...|$|R

There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} <b>time</b> <b>difference,</b> which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E

Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In {{the early stages of the}} bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group.

Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E
