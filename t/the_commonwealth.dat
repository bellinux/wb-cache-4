5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth</b> context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members.

Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth,</b> Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E

Báthory reorganised the judiciary by formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, it was of little concern to Báthory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the piechota wybraniecka, an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed to modernize <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth</b> army, reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth,</b> transforming a prior Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, {{while at the same time}} being respectful of <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth</b> policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.|$|E
