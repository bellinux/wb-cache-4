40|$|Abstract: The {{so-called}} Electronic <b>Throttle</b> <b>Control</b> <b>unit</b> was a {{big step}} towards reducing important parameters like fuel consumption or exhaust emmission. Due to its safety-criticality, a dependability study was initiated by the manufacturer Siemens Automotive. As the most important result, values could be stated for the quantitative estimation of the safety-critical and the availability-relevant cases. The study {{was based on the}} existing safety concept, but after this study, a slightly changed system architecture of the ECU was proposed to VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie), which enhances availability and safety of the ECU significantly, at about the same cost. For this study, a new kind of Markov evaluation method was used, called TEFT (Time-Extended Fault Trees). This was necessary to deal with concepts like multiple faults, faulty states, and time. In this paper, the questions raised by the Electronic Throttle Control system are described, together with our way to solve these problems...|$|E
50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1987 for the Subaru XT, the active torque split AWD variant uses an electronically controlled multi-plate transfer clutch for a default torque distribution of 60% front, 40% rear ratio. Torque distribution is adjusted up to a 50:50 split in realtime with {{input from the}} <b>throttle,</b> transmission, engine <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and wheel speed sensors. Active torque split AWD is paired with 4-speed automatic transmissions and Subaru's chain-driven Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT).|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{conventional}} direct mechanical connection from the rider's twistgrip to the <b>throttle,</b> electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> ("throttle by wire") commands the engine <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> to modulate engine power output.|$|R
50|$|Usually, the <b>throttle</b> valve is <b>controlled</b> with a <b>throttle</b> pedal or lever via {{a direct}} {{mechanical}} linkage. In vehicles with electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control,</b> the manual <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> sends {{a signal to}} the Engine <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU), which then directly controls the position of the throttle valve. This means that the operator does not have direct <b>control</b> over the <b>throttle</b> valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} advanced, so did {{the electronics}} that go into cars. The electronic <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in a modern automobile, together with advanced engine technology, {{makes it possible to}} control many aspects of the engine's operation, such as spark timing and fuel injection. The electronic <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> may also <b>control</b> electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> (drive-by-wire), poppet valve timing, boost control (in turbocharged engines), Anti-lock braking system, the automatic transmission, speed governor (if equipped), and the Electronic Stability Control system.|$|R
5000|$|This {{also allows}} {{the use of}} a much softer spring in the actuator. For instance, a [...] spring {{together}} with a boost controller may still be able to achieve a maximum boost level of well over [...] The electronic <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> can be programmed to control [...] psi at half throttle, [...] at 3/4 throttle, and [...] at full throttle, or whatever levels the programmer or designer of the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> intends. This partial <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> greatly increases driver control over the engine and vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Automobile {{accelerator}} pedals {{have historically}} been mechanical assemblies which link the pedal to the engine throttle by mechanical linkages or a Bowden cable. With the advent of electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control,</b> accelerator pedals consist of a spring-loaded pedal arm connected to an electronic transducer. This transducer, typically a potentiometer orHall effect sensor, converts {{the position of the}} pedal arm to an electronic signal which is sent to an electronic <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU).|$|R
2500|$|The engine package {{includes}} an engine <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> remapping and minor engine modifications that boost {{power on the}} 4.3L engine by , and torque by [...] <b>Throttle</b> <b>control</b> is also remapped. Also included is an exhaust modification which allows the driver to leave the by-pass valves in three separate settings. The suspension package replaces portions of the car's suspension with Bilstein and Eibach parts, which are claimed to make the vehicle more planted and accurate through the corners.|$|R
5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the throttle cable, {{to activate the}} throttle linkages, which move the throttle plate. In cars with electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor <b>controls</b> the <b>throttle</b> linkages and {{the accelerator}} pedal connects not to the throttle body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU). The ECU determines the throttle opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
50|$|Examples include {{electronic}} <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> and brake-by-wire.|$|R
50|$|The {{helicopter}} {{is controlled}} using a two lever <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>controls</b> operate {{similar to a}} real helicopter. The <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> provides proportional control of the blade speed. The pitch control provides for tilting the Vertibird forward or backward. During flight the VertiBird {{is subject to the}} same physical flight characteristics as a real helicopter. This included ground-effects for low level hovering, plus altitude gains and losses when changing direction. Overall the VertiBird is easy to learn how to pilot for basic flight, but precision flying will require some patience and time on the controls as in a real helicopter.|$|R

5000|$|A {{throttle}} position sensor (TPS) is a sensor used to monitor the {{throttle position}} of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the position of the throttle. More advanced forms of the sensor are also used, for example an extra closed {{throttle position sensor}} (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the throttle is completely closed. Some engine <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (ECUs) also <b>control</b> the <b>throttle</b> position electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with automatic <b>throttle</b> and elevator <b>controls</b> {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or rate of pitch may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral <b>control</b> on the <b>throttle</b> or a combination of <b>throttle</b> and elevator <b>controls.</b> Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means of an automatic <b>throttle</b> <b>control.</b> 1.
