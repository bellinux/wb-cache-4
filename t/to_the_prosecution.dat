5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{established}} occupation administrations in Austria and Germany. The former {{became a}} neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter {{was divided into}} western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A denazification programme in Germany led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of Nazi war criminals {{and the removal of}} ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} {{ties and}} inheritance issues within {{the immediate and}} extended family added a layer of complexity to the case. Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It {{was one of those}} cousins who found the silencer in the gun cupboard after the murders, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{alternatives}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public criminal <b>prosecution</b> {{have changed}} <b>the</b> criminal laws. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional way of}} settling the disputes which puts emphasis on analyzing the committed crimes, the most significant factor in alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public <b>prosecution</b> is <b>the</b> conditions, in which the crime happens. The present research seeks <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> problems and challenges {{in the way of}} developing and increasing <b>the</b> alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>prosecution</b> by taking <b>the</b> England’s laws into consideration. <b>The</b> alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>prosecution</b> are an intermediate approach that are substituted for criminal <b>prosecution</b> and filing <b>the</b> criminal record away unconditionally. In this way, the aim of the punishments is achieved without imposing the punishment. <b>The</b> alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>prosecutions</b> are based on the ideological, criminological and practical principles. There are many similar cases of imposing alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>prosecutions</b> on <b>the</b> defendants in Islamic teachings. But <b>the</b> alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>prosecutions</b> have not properly developed in Iran. Their development faces with many theoretical and practical challenges. According the investigations, we can define the theoretical challenges faced with alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>prosecutions</b> as <b>the</b> series of the factors and reasons that impede the development of this idea and runs it into the problem. In other words, lack of intention and will to apply these alternatives...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prosecution</b> of Offences Act 1985 (c. 23) was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Its {{main effects}} were <b>to</b> {{establish}} <b>the</b> Crown <b>Prosecution</b> Service (CPS), <b>to</b> transfer <b>the</b> responsibility of <b>prosecution</b> of offences from <b>the</b> police <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CPS, and <b>to</b> codify <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> process.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, Manzie was {{appointed}} second permanent secretary {{and chief executive}} of the Property Services Agency. He {{was appointed}} to resolve problems of widespread corruption at the agency. His work led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> of a number of the agency's staff.|$|R
5|$|The log {{discusses}} {{a telephone}} call made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> this is the telephone call {{known to have been}} made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} very {{suitable}} and happy connexion, my wife {{being a woman}} of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all my time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of my studies, and the other duties of my station.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E

W. Bush, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and Gerrit Pretorius, private secretary to South Africa's former foreign minister Pik Botha.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E

25|$|Pre-trial {{hearings}} {{dragged on}} through the remainder of 1986. The government sought to protect Presser's identity as an informant. Presser's attorneys not only sought to expose the relationship but uncover evidence that Presser's actions were sanctioned {{by the government and}} had helped lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of other criminals. On December 2, 1986, government officials finally testified in open court that Presser was indeed a valuable and high-level informant who had assisted DOJ in exposing other labor racketeers. The FBI, fearing for Presser's life, offered him protection under the federal witness program, but Presser refused.|$|E
25|$|The future {{robustness}} of {{the highly}} secret investigation, in progress since 2008, may however be in some doubt. According to the leading Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, soon after Siemiątkowski was charged by the prosecutors in Warsaw, the case was transferred and is now expected to be handled by a different prosecutorial team in Cracow. The United States authorities have refused {{to cooperate with the}} investigation and the turning over of the relevant documents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> by the unwilling Intelligence Agency was forced only after the statutory intervention of the First President of the Supreme Court of Poland.|$|E
25|$|A {{procedural}} hearing at the Appeal Court {{took place}} on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed a number of legal issues with a panel of three judges. One of the issues concerned a number of documents that were shown before the trial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> but were not disclosed to the defence. The documents are understood {{to relate to the}} Mebo MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb. Maggie Scott also asked for documents relating to an alleged payment of $2million made to Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, for his testimony at the trial, which led to the conviction of Megrahi.|$|E

25|$|The {{second appeal}} {{was to have}} been heard by five Scottish judges in 2009 at the Court of Criminal Appeal. A {{procedural}} hearing at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh took place on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence Counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed legal issues with a panel of three judges. One of the issues concerns a number of CIA documents that were shown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> but were not disclosed to the defence.

Further procedural hearings were scheduled to take place between December 2007 and June 2008.|$|E
25|$|Once Garfield died, the {{government}} officially charged Guiteau with murder. He was formally indicted on October 14, 1881, on {{the charge of}} murder, which was previously attempted murder after his arrest. Guiteau {{pleaded not guilty to}} the charge. The trial began on November 14, 1881, in Washington, D.C. The presiding judge in the case was Walter Smith Cox. Guiteau's court-appointed defense lawyers were Leigh Robinson and George Scoville, although Guiteau would insist on trying to represent himself during the entire trial. Wayne MacVeagh, the U.S. Attorney General, served as the chief prosecutor. MacVeagh named five lawyers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> team: George Corkhill, Walter Davidge, retired judge John K. Porter, Elihu Root, and E.B. Smith.|$|E
25|$|Cabey {{ended up}} slumped {{in the short}} seat {{in the corner of}} the car next to the conductor's cab. Whether Cabey was struck by the fourth shot or by the fifth was {{critical}} to Goetz's claim of self-defense; this issue was fiercely contested at trial. Medical testimony said that such an injury would render the lower half of Cabey's body instantly useless. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> the fourth shot missed; then Goetz shot a seated Cabey at point-blank range with the fifth. The defense theory of how Cabey ended up in the seat was that he was standing when hit by the fourth shot, then collapsed into the seat due to the lurching and swaying of the train; with the fifth shot being the shot that missed.|$|E
