The focus on Norness Shipping created anxiety among Anglo American shareholders as to whether enough was being done to expand that company.

It is divided in three titles. The first title describes the institutional framework of the EU and the legal context in which the Court decides on its cases. The basic elements of the international tax systems of the Member States are briefly recalled, as well as the EC Treaty provisions and secondary legislation relevant for direct taxation. In the second title, the Court’s judgments in the area <b>of</b> direct <b>taxation</b> are analysed.

She finds this to be a normative rationale for a double tax system under optimal tax principles due to the inelasticity of demand for and supply of liquidity and the economic rent it produces. The value of liquidity in different capital markets is the crucial determinate. Under traditional tax policy criteria of horizontal and vertical equity and efficiency, this approach correctly classifies those firms that can normatively be included in a double tax system after an interest return on equity is deducted. Drawing the line at liquidity allows the fullest expansion of passthrough regimes such as Subchapter S and partnership taxation as well as other forms of integration...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the extent to which UK equity prices reflect shareholder level taxation on dividends (dividend tax capitalisation). Despite an extensive theoretical and empirical literature controversy exists. Design/methodology/approach ? Using a sample of UK firm year ends from 1991 to 2007 archival accounting and share price data are used to test for the presence or otherwise of dividend tax capitalisation. Findings ? The paper finds evidence of equity values reflecting shareholder level dividend taxation. In particular, a significant reduction in the valuation of retained earnings, a measure of dividend paying potential, is observed around the July 1997 abolition of the repayment of dividend tax credits to tax exempt shareholders. This suggests a link between <b>shareholder</b> level <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividends and firms? cost of capital. Research limitations/implications ? The analysis focuses on share prices and is therefore subject to an underlying assumption <b>of</b> <b>shareholders?</b> understanding tax and other potential relevant information. Practical implications ? The <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividends is an important issue because of the potential for it to influence firms? cost of capital and therefore investment decisions. Further, non-tax costs may be incurred to the extent that attempts are made to mitigate any ?adverse? tax effects. Social implications ? The results indicate that <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividends and share prices are associated and therefore also indirectly firms? cost of capital. This linkage has implications for investment appraisal and the allocation of capital between competing demands. Originality/value ? In using an asset valuation approach the limitations of alternate methods <b>of</b> examining <b>shareholder</b> level <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividends are avoided, e. g. analysis of dividend drop of ratios. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

The <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> {{dividends}} at <b>shareholder</b> {{level has}} been the norm {{in the majority of}} the international market. South Africa is a developing country that is constantly increasing its market share in the international stage and in order to be more competitive in the international market South Africa has to align itself with international norms and practices and this resulted, amongst other things, with the introduction of dividends tax in 2012. This study analysed the new dividends tax legislation that became effective on 1 April 2012 in South Africa, by way of a normative literature review, and briefly discusses how South Africa compares with Russia, India and China, three other developing countries. The literature review confirmed the benefits with regards to the dividends tax system; however, the review also confirmed that there are challenges within the dividends tax system. The benefits of the dividends tax system that were noted include amongst others; aligning South Africa with international tax norms, the increased tax base and the establishment of a familiar withholding tax system that can attract more foreign investment. The levying of dividends tax on beneficial owners results in an increased tax base because the number of taxpayers increases to companies and individuals, versus levying secondary tax on companies only on the companies paying the dividend. Some of the challenges of the dividends tax system are the administrative burden placed on companies and regulated intermediaries, the rate of 15 % might be considered to be too high in comparison to other developing countries and the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividends {{in the hands of the}} individuals might be a disincentive to invest in equity shares. South African legislation on dividends tax differs from that of China; with the latter country taxing the dividends in the hands of the beneficial owners without a requirement on company‘s paying the dividend to withhold the dividends tax. The Russian legislation on <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividends is similar to that of South Africa but taxes the dividend on the net amount. In India the dividend distribution tax is levied in the company making a dividend distribution...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> benefits, which <b>shareholders</b> {{and company}} leaders can enjoy from close corporations. The Government {{said in the}} government bill lead- ing to the amendments regarding <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> benefits, {{that it should be}} the possibility alone to enjoy benefits that should be the reason to impose taxes on company lead- ers. The Swedish tax agency (Skatteverket) has agreed to that statement. In other words, it isn’t necessary that someone actually enjoys the company’s assets for pri- vate use, it is enough that they have the right of disposal of them in order to be taxed. The question that arises is how a benefit can be defined as something you can enjoy rather then something you actually enjoy. The objective of this thesis is to straighten out if there are legal grounds for imposing taxes on company leaders just because they have the right of disposal to the compa- ny’s assets, and in that case which those legal grounds are. Different courts have interpreted the law in different ways in a number of cases, which this thesis gives an account of. In summery, the conclusion {{is that there are a}} legal grounds for imposing these taxes on company leaders because of their right of disposal to the company’s assets. The case law has interpreted the law and the gov- ernment bill, and from that interpretation developed a rule that declares that owners and leaders in close corporations shall be taxed based on their right of disposal. The reason for this is that the vision for the enactor is to reach neutrality between people who run and own companies and people who are employed in a regular way. The rule that assess company leaders in close corporations because of their right of disposals preventing people from letting their company pay their private cost of living. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a model of}} an insurer {{incorporating}} frictional costs of capital and assess and illustrate an optimal capital management strategy. Frictional costs of capital are the additional <b>taxation</b> on profits <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> from an insurer’s business over and above those from direct equity investment in financial assets, transaction costs in raising equity capital, moral hazard and adverse selection costs from underwriting insurance risks, agency costs such as management perquisites, {{as well as the}} costs of financial distress and insolvency including legal costs and loss of new business opportunities. These costs are deadweight losses to equity investors in an insurer and need to be minimised in order to maximise shareholder returns. Frictional costs of capital do not include the expected return to shareholders, normally regarded as the nominal cost of capital. Fair pricing taking into account risk and optimal capital provides a fair expected rate <b>of</b> return to <b>shareholders.</b> A trade-off exists between the frictional costs of the solvent insurer and the contingent financial distress costs of the insolvent insurer. Higher levels of capital will lower expected financial distress costs but increase other frictional costs such as additional taxation, agency, moral hazard and adverse selection costs. By minimising total expected frictional costs, the model determines the optimal trade-off and the optimal level of insurer capital. The model includes adjustment costs of raising and shedding capital. The paper has implications for the long run sustainability of insurers. The efficient management of the frictional costs of capital should be a focus of the risk management strategy of an insurer and is essential for the long run survival of an insurer...|$|R
