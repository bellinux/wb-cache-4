5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore {{begins with a}} black and white {{flashback}} to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Dried {{sticks of}} the {{liquorice}} root {{are also a}} traditional confectionery {{in their own right}} in the Netherlands, which has quickly waned in popularity in recent decades. They were sold simply as sticks of zoethout ('sweet wood') <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> as as a candy. Through chewing and suckling, the intensely sweet flavour is released. The sweetness is 30 to 50 times as strong as sucrose, without causing damage to teeth. Roughly since the 1970's, zoethout has become rarer in favor of easier to consume candies (including 'drop').|$|E
500|$|Meredith {{was able}} to avoid injury {{throughout}} his career, despite the extremely physical nature of the game during the period. This was {{due in part to}} his extraordinary balance and agility, which allowed him to avoid clumsy challenges, and the toughness he had built up from spending his adolescence working in the mines. A model professional, he spent his spare time improving his game with extra training sessions and maintained peak physical fitness by avoiding alcohol and tobacco. His [...] "gimmick" [...] was <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> a toothpick during matches, and this unusual trait was picked up on by cartoonists of the time.|$|E

500|$|Flocke's {{growth was}} {{carefully}} {{reported by the}} media during her first few months. [...] Four zookeepers took turns bottle-feeding the cub with 140 milliliters of artificial milk every four hours and news of her eyes opening {{for the first time}} made headlines a few days before she was officially named. [...] At five weeks old, she was referred to by the publication Bild as [...] "Mrs. Knut", suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates when they mature. [...] As she grew, Flocke's diet was enriched with dog food, and boiled bones were supplied for her <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> when she was three months old. [...] She was soon taken to the zoo's beginners' pool to practice her swimming skills. [...] The zoo had previously stated that they were seeking another orphaned polar or brown bear cub to raise alongside Flocke in order to improve her development.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, a mid-credits scene teasing X-Men: Days of Future Past was {{attached}} to the theatrical release of The Wolverine. The scene, set two years after the events of The Wolverine, depicts Wolverine going through an airport security checkpoint while a commercial for Trask Industries plays in the background. Suddenly, Wolverine notices that all the metal objects around him start to shake and levitate. He turns around to see Magneto, who says he needs Wolverine's help to combat a threat to all mutants. When Wolverine asks Magneto why he should trust him, the people around them freeze as Xavier approaches Wolverine and assures him that Magneto is telling the truth. Adam Pockross of Yahoo! Movies described the mid-credits scene as the coolest part of The Wolverine and wrote, [...] "Boom! And that's how you tease the next film: by giving us so much <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on,</b> yet so few answers".|$|E
500|$|The fifth part of [...] "Trinity War" [...] {{was given}} 4 stars out of 5 by Doug Zawiska at Comic Book Resources. He said, [...] "The pacing of Justice League Dark #23 is smart and gives readers lots <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on,</b> {{but it also}} leaves {{what seems like a}} lot left to be {{resolved}} in the approaching final chapter of [...] "Trinity War"." [...] He also praised Janin's ability to accurately draw the characters used in the issue. Joshua Yehl of IGN also had similar sentiments, saying [...] "While [...] "Trinity War’s" [...] overall story is wonky, this chapter of Justice League Dark at least makes it a fun time." [...] He also enjoyed Janin's art and gave the issue a 7.6 out of 10. Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "Everything about this issue feels like a climax...even if next week’s final chapter proves to be less than definitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ian Freer of Empire {{gave the}} film 4/5 stars. Freer {{emphasized}} the [...] "bold, daring original filmmaking, with arguably more emotional and intellectual meat <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> {{than either the}} Rings trilogy or Kong." [...] Freer noted that, like The Lord of the Rings, the film [...] "does a fantastic job with revered, complex source material" [...] and that, since it is [...] "as terrific on terra firma as it is audacious in its astral plane", it is [...] "doubtful" [...] {{that there would be}} a [...] "more imaginative" [...] and [...] "courageous film" [...] in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|On May 25, 2012, an 11-minute video titled 1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick was {{uploaded}} to Bestgore.com, {{depicting a}} naked male {{tied to a}} bed frame being repeatedly stabbed with an ice pick and a kitchen knife, then dismembered, followed by acts of necrophilia. The perpetrator uses a knife and fork to cut {{off some of the}} flesh and gets a dog <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> the body. During the video, the 1987 New Order song [...] "True Faith" [...] plays in the background, and a poster for the 1942 film Casablanca is visible on the wall.

5000|$|<b>To</b> {{discourage}} <b>chewing</b> <b>on</b> an object, {{it can be}} coated or {{covered with}} something to make it distasteful: for instance a soft cloth doused with chili pepper paste or powder. Capsaicin and Ro-pel are other forms of repellent. To remain effective, the coating must be renewed regularly, especially if it is exposed to the weather. Poisoning squirrels can be problematic because of the risks to innocent parties, [...] and because the odor of a dead squirrel in an attic or wall cavity is very unpleasant and persistent.|$|R
2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reports a}} 100% {{approval}} rating, based on 15 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""The Coat Hanger" [...] boasts controversial themes, effective scares, well-played justification of the illogical, and noteworthy performances all around." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN thought [...] "The Coat Hanger" [...] was [...] "a bit busy; focusing in {{on all the}} characters {{and most of the}} storylines", but added, [...] "It also revved up the story a bit and gave us all some tough meat <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> over the break." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

2500|$|Champing {{at the bit}}, also worded chomping at the bit or chafing at the bit, {{meaning to}} show impatience or burst with energy, [...] refers to a {{tendency}} of some horses, when impatient or nervous, and especially if being held back by their riders, <b>to</b> <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> the bit, often salivating excessively. [...] This behavior is sometimes accompanied by head-tossing or pawing at the ground. [...] Because this behavior was most often seen {{by the general public}} in horses who were anxious to begin a horse race {{in the days before the}} invention of the starting gate, the term has become popular in everyday speech to refer to a person who is anxious to get started or to do something. [...] Because some impatient horses, when held back, would also occasionally rear, a related phrase, [...] "raring to go," [...] is also derived from observations of equine behavior.|$|E

50|$|After Grand Valley {{played in}} the 2001 NCAA Division II National Championship in football, John Butler, {{president}} of the Peoria Rivermen (an East Coast Hockey League franchise), accused Grand Valley of trademark infringement {{for the use of}} the Louie logo.

Louie closely resembled the ECHL Rivermen's own logo, a sailor dressed similarly <b>to</b> Louie <b>chewing</b> <b>on</b> a hockey puck.
