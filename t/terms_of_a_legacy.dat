50|$|The Hume {{family had}} settled at Humewood {{and built a}} castle there in the 15th century. The estate passed down through {{successive}} generations to Fitzwilliam Hume (1805-1892) who was the wealthy MP for Wicklow from 1852 to 1880. He commissioned architect William White to design a country retreat for the summer and the shooting season. White exceeded his brief and the final result, built between 1867 and 1870, was today's Gothic fantasy which far exceeded the budget, bankrupting White in the process. Fitzwilliam Hume assumed the surname of Dick in 1864 under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>legacy.</b> His only son William Hume inherited the property and was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Wicklow and served as High Sheriff of Wicklow for 1896.|$|E
40|$|Despite volunteers being {{essential}} {{for the success of}} many mega sport events, there is little knownabout what motivates them to volunteer at such events. This study aims to address this gap. Thisarticle commences by developing Getz’s event portfolio into a new expanded sport event typology. It continues by presenting the results to three key questions: (1) Who is volunteering? (2) What aretheir motivations for volunteering, and (3) What variables {{are most likely to be}} related to their intentionto volunteer after the event. The study used <b>an</b> adaptation <b>of</b> the Special Event VolunteerMotivation Scale on volunteers at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. Aprincipal components analysis of the 36 motivation items identified six factors that accounted for 58. 3 % of the variance, with the main factor entitled “All about the Games. ” A regression analysisconducted to identify those variables most likely to indicate an intention to volunteer more after theGames demonstrated that those who could see an advantage in more volunteering pregames weremost likely to intend to increase their level of volunteering postgames. People with previous volunteeringexperience in events, sport, or community groups were less likely to indicate they wouldvolunteer more after the event. The results and recommendations have implications for megamultisportevent organizing committees not just in respect of event delivery but in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> posteventvolunteer <b>legacy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Almost {{half of the}} South African {{population}} lives in poverty. The circumstances of particularly the poor {{in the rural areas}} are worse in absolute and relative <b>terms</b> because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> unequal access, control and distribution of resources. The aim of this research {{study was to examine the}} nature and the effect of poverty on families in a rural area and to provide guidelines for the empowerment of poverty stricken families. From the research study it was clear that the inhabitants of Modimola village were very poor, taking into account their low level of education, high rate of illiteracy, small income and unsatisfactory living conditions. They even experienced <b>a</b> shortage <b>of</b> basic needs such as water, electricity and transport. Several factors contribute to their poverty, such as lack of job opportunities, lack of skills and lack of support from the government and additionally, due to improper infrastructure. It was evident that poverty had a negative effect on the families, and that problems such as malnutrition, illiteracy, ill health, marital problems, unemployment and violence were rife in the community. The people were unable to help themselves and felt hopeless and useless. They need to be empowered. The social worker has an important role to play in this regard. She can play the parts of social broker, enabler, teacher, mediator and advocate so as to help the people alleviate their poverty. Master...|$|R

50|$|It was {{constructed}} between 1788 and 1817 for John Wharton, Member of Parliament for Beverley who had inherited the ruined Skelton Castle {{from his father}} Joseph Hall-Stevenson in 1786. John Wharton had changed his name from Hall-Stevenson to Wharton {{to comply with the}} <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>legacy.</b> He inherited a considerable fortune from his aunt, much of which he spent of demolishing the castle and building his new home. He died childless and in poverty in 1843 and Skelton devolved to his nephew John Thomas Wharton of Gilling. The property then descended in the Wharton family to William Henry Anthony Wharton, High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1925, and on his death in 1938, to his daughter Margaret Winsome Ringrose Wharton. She had married Christopher Hildyard Ringrose, a Royal Navy captain, who had added the additional surname of Wharton to that of Ringrose. She lived there until at least 1986, by which time her relative, Major Wharton, actually ran the estate on account of her age.|$|E
40|$|South Africa is {{a uniquely}} mineral rich country. Of the six types of {{asbestiform}} minerals {{found in the}} country, three, namely crocidolite, amosite and chrysotile were mined and milled on a large commercial scale. Asbestos was used locally in South Africa, {{but the majority of}} its production was exported worldwide. In the 1970 s, South Africa was the world’s third largest producer of asbestos, behind Canada and the USSR. About 97 % of the world’s production of crocidolite and virtually all of the amosite came from South Africa. The output from the South African asbestos mining industry peaked at 380, 000 tonnes in 1977 and declined thereafter as export markets declined due to restrictive legislation in countries that imported asbestos (Virta, 2006; Kielkowski et al., 2011). Legislation in South Africa banning the use of all types of asbestos came into effect in 2008, well after the last asbestos mine ceased production in 2001 and closed in 2002. Although South Africa benefitted financially from the exploitation of its asbestos mineral reserves, the revenue from asbestos never accounted for more than 3 % of the value of its total minerals output (McCulloch, 2003). There is however a high price to pay in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of disease and environmental contamination through mining activities and the transport of asbestos and asbestos containing products...|$|E
