5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic crystal system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> than diamond, but the size {{and quality of the}} available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Abscesses may be {{classified}} as either skin abscesses or internal abscesses. Skin abscesses are common; internal abscesses tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to diagnose, and more serious. Skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversial}} {{new type}} of cricket ball, the white ‘Duke’, was introduced {{for the first time}} in the 1999 World Cup.

25|$|The IRA {{declared}} a brief ceasefire in 1972 {{and a more}} protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, cell-based structure, which was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to penetrate. The IRA now tried {{to carry out a}} smaller scale but more sustained campaign which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the 'terrorist phase' of the IRA's campaign.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{considered}} {{the writing of}} Blood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> compared to previous OSI albums. Previously, Matheos would send Moore guitar parts to work with, allowing Moore to [...] "work with editing them, pitching them, and fucking about them different ways, and then programming drums and keyboards." [...] When working on Blood, Matheos also provided programming, keyboard and drum parts. [...] "If he sent me stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts, and it wasn't a complete idea, I {{had to figure out}} a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there," [...] Moore said. Overall, he {{considered the}} writing process to be [...] "smoother because we got on a roll and we're more fluid together".|$|E

500|$|As {{the game}} was to retain the same engine, the {{developers}} could not add new gameplay features. Campbell instead {{set out to make}} the levels more interesting, creating multiple paths through the missions. More obvious solutions would be more difficult, and the hidden, [...] "proper" [...] paths easier to execute once deduced. While Campbell intended the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder,</b> he also wished to improve the difficulty curve, which he argued was a flaw of its predecessor. He also tended to make the levels smaller and reduced instances of water obstacles, which he regarded as frustrating in the first game. The designer conceded that some levels turned out to be too difficult – due to his inexperience as a developer and the fact he became so skilled while play testing – but maintained that level 8 of the original was worse than any of his creations. Campbell named most of the game's levels after songs titles and lyrics (prominently The Jesus and Mary Chain), but also referenced wider pop culture artifacts such as gameshows and Bugs Bunny cartoons, as well as some original titles. He also referenced classic games in the level design itself.|$|E
2500|$|The site added {{advertising}} {{over the}} course of late 2004, placed above and to the left and right of material, and, in 2005, in the site's RSS feed as well.

2500|$|Wilson {{also studied}} public administration, {{which he called}} [...] "{{government}} in action; it is the executive, the operative, the most visible side of government, and is of course as old as government itself". He believed {{that the study of}} public administration could enable officials to increase governmental efficiency. He faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere [...] "practical detail". He thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations. By his day, he thought, [...] "it is getting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to run a constitution than to frame one." [...] He thought it time [...] "to straighten the paths of government, to make its business less unbusinesslike, to strengthen and purify its organization, and it to crown its dutifulness". He summarized the growth of such foreign states as Prussia, France, and England, highlighting the events that led to advances in administration.|$|E

2500|$|As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain {{remains a}} large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy {{took over the}} {{government}} with his conservative views, pushing out José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his left-wing views. [...] Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to {{not be enough to}} restore the economy. [...] There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would have to be put in place to restore the economy at this point. The recession has been a concern for a while and shows no sign of lifting any time soon as Spain has yet to meet budget cuts and shows no sign of changing. [...] Many youths are trying to find jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market. [...] Rajoy recently proposed a new budget for 2013 that would be very different and would cut government spending by 8.9%. By April 2013, unemployment had risen to 27%.|$|E
