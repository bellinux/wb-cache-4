5|$|Her {{childhood}} was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her {{father was a}} younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother {{was considered one of}} the most intelligent and elegant women of the court.

5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may never {{have been aware of}} it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E
5|$|Although Bucer {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress. Both Bucer and Fagius had noticed that the 1549 Prayer Book was not a remarkable step forward, although Cranmer assured Bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was only temporary. However, by the winter 1550, Bucer was becoming disillusioned. Cranmer, however, made sure that he did not feel alienated and kept in close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> This attention paid off during the vestments controversy. This incident was initiated by John Hooper, a follower of Heinrich Bullinger who had recently returned from Zürich. Hooper was unhappy with Cranmer's Prayer Book and Ordinal and he particularly objected to the use of ceremonies and vestments. When the Privy Council selected him to be the Bishop of Gloucester on 15 May 1550, he laid down conditions that he would not wear the required vestments. He found an ally among the Continental reformers in Jan Łaski who had become a leader of the Stranger church in London, a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees. His church's forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked. However, Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper's position, supported Cranmer's arguments of timing and authority. Cranmer and Ridley stood their ground. This led to Hooper's imprisonment and he eventually gave in. He was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the Ordinal and he preached before the king in his episcopal garments. Cranmer's vision of reform through careful steps under the authority of the government was maintained.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Kentucky Educational Television series Kentucky Afield {{devoted a}} portion of their weekly hunting and fishing {{oriented}} show to Brown and his turtle catching. The segment was posted on YouTube and went viral; as of June 2012, it had garnered more than 4 million hits. The video and a similar one posted on the web site of the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper attracted the attention of television producer Matt Sharp of Sharp Entertainment. Brown relates that, while performing as a sideshow at the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, a group of executives from Sharp Entertainment and Animal Planet, who were there on an unrelated assignment, approached him about doing a television show. The executives told Brown that they had been trying to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for over a year, but that his fellow performers had refused to deliver their messages to him.|$|E
25|$|Sony {{was born}} Warrick Swinney in Port Elizabeth on 12 September 1958. He {{grew up in}} the Cowies Hill area of Durban, {{attending}} Westville High School where he played in school-based groups doing covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix and The Who. He was influenced by Indian music and cuisine and by the work of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. He learned to play tabla at the Hindu Sarat school in Durban. In 1976 he was conscripted into the South African Defence Force, where he declared himself a Hindu pacifist, and was assigned to medical duties and then to band work. During his military service, Sony played B♭ horn, euphonium and drums. He changed his surname from Swinney to Sony to make it harder for the army to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for camps; he chose Sony because he liked their products. Whilst in the army in 1977, his father brought him a whole lot of punk rock albums from an overseas trip. This was his first exposure to Sex Pistols and the Clash. By the time his two years service was over he had schooled himself {{in a lot of the}} post punk Art rock bands as well as reggae and dub and had developed a healthy respect for Shangaan bass players.|$|E

The group commenced a full-scale tour behind the album in October 2002, with 22 North American shows supported by the Used and H2O.|$|E

Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design, {{and kept}} in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> after they graduated. A few years later, MacFarlane {{contacted}} him about {{being part of the}} show; he agreed and came on as a writer and voice actor. During the show's first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with season five's [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", he has been credited as a main cast member.|$|E
500|$|Jerry has {{problems}} with a childhood friend, Joel Horneck, who persists in keeping in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He does not like Horneck, who does not pay attention to anything that Jerry says. Jerry says that he feels uncomfortable [...] "breaking up with" [...] Horneck, so George suggests that he should pretend that Horneck is a woman and break up normally. Jerry therefore attempts to break up with Horneck at Monk's Café, but Horneck bursts into tears. Deeply uncomfortable, Jerry assures Horneck he didn't mean it, and agrees {{to take him to}} see the New York Knicks, although he was supposed to take George.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky {{finished}} his final revision of Romeo and Juliet in 1880, and felt it a courtesy {{to send a}} copy of the score to Balakirev. Balakirev, however, had dropped out of the music scene in the early 1870s and Tchaikovsky had lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He asked the publisher Bessel to forward a copy to Balakirev. A year later Balakirev replied. In the same letter that he thanked Tchaikovsky profusely for the score, Balakirev suggested [...] "the programme for a symphony which you would handle wonderfully well", a detailed plan for a symphony based on Lord Byron's Manfred. Originally drafted by Stasov in 1868 for Hector Berlioz as a sequel to that composer's Harold en Italie, the program had since been in Balakirev's care.|$|E

500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his escape, Jaishankar had {{fractured}} his leg while {{jumping from}} the 30 feet {{wall of the}} prison compound. He had taken care not to contact his family in Tamil Nadu, assuming that the police would {{keep an eye on}} them. Soon after his escape, a police informant managed to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> The informant lured him to a dilapidated building near [...] the Kudlu gate in Bangalore, with the promise of a motorbike to facilitate his escape outside the city. There, the police arrested Jaishankar, on the noon of 6 September 2013. The Government spent over [...] 75,000 treating his fractured leg at the Victoria Hospital, where he was operated on, on 23 September.|$|E
2500|$|Saves the Day's guitarist {{had left}} {{at the end of}} their first full tour of the U.S. Guitarist Dave Soloway, who had driven the band to their gigs during high school, was added to the band. Conley {{described}} Soloway as a kid who [...] "came from bluegrass and his family would sit around singing folk songs and stuff at home." [...] Guitarist Ted Alexander was the band's roadie, and spent so much time with the band that they eventually [...] "just gave him a guitar". Sean McGrath, bassist on the band's first album, was kicked out of the band and replaced by Eben D'Amico. The group played gigs with local bands, one of which D'Amico was in. Conley called him a [...] "sick" [...] bassist and decided to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> asking if he would like to join Saves the Day.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later, Mr Key {{had to admit}} in Parliament {{that he had been}} {{communicating}} with Cameron Slater by text about Gwyn's report prior to its release. Given that Slater is perceived, in John Armstrong's words, as [...] "the second most-despised figure in New Zealand politics" [...] (after Kim Dotcom), parliamentarians and media commentators were surprised that Key was still in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Armstrong said by acknowledging his links with Slater, Key [...] "compromised his assurance that he had no knowledge of the dirty tricks operation". Bryce Edwards said that Key could not afford to cut ties with Slater [...] "out of fear of what could happen if Slater became his enemy". Matthew Hooten said this could lead to John Key's 'downfall' as he [...] "risks Cameron Slater going off the deep-end and revealing the full extent of his relationship with the Prime Minister himself, the Prime Minister's Office, with a number of John Key's ministers, with a fair bunch of the backbenchers, and with some senior party officials".|$|E

2500|$|On November 18, 2008, Blabbermouth.net {{announced}} Believer's {{signing with}} Cesspool Recordings, an imprint of Metal Blade Records owned by Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage. In {{an interview with}} Metalsucks.net, Bachman commented that the announcement about the band's re-activation had spread to the industry, and a staff member from Blabbermouth/Roadrunner Records suggested that they should contact Howard: [...] "We got in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{and it turns out}} he is a big Believer fan. He knows more about the history of Believer than we do! It was really cool. So we flew him in to the studio, we worked with him over two days. Then he mentioned that he was starting this imprint with Brian Slagel from Metal Blade and he asked us if we wanted to be the first band on it." [...] Jones forwarded the band to Slagel whom reportedly replied: [...] "Believer? Absolutely, lets do this.'" [...] "It was sort of an easy process for us as far as the business end of it was concerned," [...] Bachman stated. They signed a 3-album deal with Metal Blade.|$|E
2500|$|Foch was {{surprised}} by the German offensive ("Bluecher") on the Chemin des Dames (27 May). Foch believed it was a diversion to draw Allied reserves away from Flanders. This was partly true, although the planned German Flanders Offensive ("Hagen") never took place. The Allied armies under Foch's command ultimately held the advance of the German forces. The celebrated phrase, [...] "I will fight in front of Paris, I will fight in Paris, I will fight behind Paris", attributed both to Foch and Clemenceau, illustrated the Généralissime's resolve to keep the Allied armies intact, even at the risk of losing the capital. The British General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanding the British Fourth Army, commented after meeting Foch: [...] "I am overjoyed at his methods and far-sighted strategy. I was in close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in 1916. He is a better man now than he was then, for his fiery enthusiasm has been tempered by adversity." [...] Rawlinson also noted Foch's intense Frenchness: [...] "He knew nothing of Britain. The Rhine was for him a river of life and death." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Portnoy left Dream Theater, {{relationships}} {{between him and}} his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails. However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie [...] "disrespectful" [...] for comments LaBrie made during an interview, stating that Dream Theater were [...] "not sad at all" [...] that Portnoy was no longer a band member. As of July 12, 2011, LaBrie has not remained in touch with Portnoy. At one point, false reports surfaced that Portnoy had sued Dream Theater. [...] Portnoy has since stated that he would rejoin the band in a heartbeat, stating: [...] "They are the ones that have closed the door on it. I’ve only needed a break, and I’ve had that break. So I’m ready, willing and able. But I honestly don’t think they ever will; they’ve closed their door on it and I think they’re too headstrong in having to prove themselves without me. So I wouldn’t count on it. But my door is always open." ...|$|E
