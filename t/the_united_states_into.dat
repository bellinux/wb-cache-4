He {{found it hard to}} find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several Consular attachés at that office, mainly doing clerical work.

5|$|After the {{government}} ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu {{in the fall}} of 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears. After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League. By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> World War II and ending Robinson's nascent football career.|$|E

Following the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> World War I in 1917, both ships were deployed to Europe. Florida was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France for the peace negotiations. Utah was assigned to convoy escort duty; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys as they approached the European continent.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed. The initial plan was to {{implement}} Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union. However, with the entry of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E

5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E

From Sydney she made a round trip to Nouméa, New Caledonia, and sailed from there to Wellington, New Zealand, where she arrived on 11 December, {{four days after the}} Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor that propelled <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> World War II.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{spoke and}} {{voted in favor}} of the {{resolution}} of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> World War I. In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had little place in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the seizure of the American vessels, Congress debated and approved the Naval Act of 1794, which authorized the building of six frigates, four of 44 guns and two of 36 guns. Supporters were mostly from the northern states and the coastal regions, who argued the Navy would result in savings in insurance and ransom payments, while opponents from southern states and inland regions thought a navy was not worth the expense and would drive <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>into</b> more costly wars.|$|E
