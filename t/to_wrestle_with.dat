5|$|While {{working in}} Ring of Honor for a year, James also debuted as Alexis Laree in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the company's second ever weekly pay-per-view, as a {{participant}} in a lingerie battle royal. She was not prominently featured until March 26, 2003, when she teamed with Amazing Red {{as part of his}} feud against the X Division Champion Kid Kash and Trinity. Laree competed in her first singles match with the promotion on April 2, 2003 in a losing effort against Trinity. Weeks later, she became the first member of The Gathering, a stable led by Raven in his feud against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett. On April 16, Laree became the first (and thus far, only) woman to compete in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, after the Gathering challenged and defeated Jarrett. She continued <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the stable while they feuded with The Disciples of the New Church, taking part in an angle with Father James Mitchell burning her with a fireball and wrestling in another Clockwork Orange House of Fun match before leaving the company.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{past the}} controversy, The Last Temptation of Christ gained {{critical}} acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the spirituality underpinning his films {{up until that}} point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for Rain Man).|$|E
50|$|In March 2012 Lou {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>wrestling</b> <b>with</b> Billy Corgan's group Resistance Pro based out of Chicago. He {{was brought}} in to specifically write for the shows as well as help talent given his performing and promoting history with ECW and WWE.|$|R

It was short-lived, {{and he left}} the sport for good in 1995. Crockett also brought the NWA back to the Dallas Sportatorium for an equally brief tenure during this time.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Japanese occupation, the Government of Hong Kong held a {{monopoly}} on the purchase and distribution of food and raw materials including rice and cotton yarn. Price controls by the Government were not eliminated until 1953. The period can best be summarised by low resources and an endless increase in population. Many mainlanders would cross the border to Hong Kong and establish illegal huts on rooftops and edge of mountains. The integration of different groups from China and original tenants of Hong Kong would also create a society in which everyone had <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the overwhelming number of language dialects.|$|E
25|$|The Labor Party {{replaced}} Rudd with Julia Gillard in 2010 {{owing to}} Rudd's unpopularity both among his frontbench and the public, so then Julia Gillard {{became the first}} woman prime minister in Australian history. Following the 2010 Election, Labor secured office in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. The Gillard Government struggled on multiple policy fronts, trying <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> a hung parliament. A scandal rocked the parliament: Speaker of the House Peter Slipper, who was a former Liberal Party member turned Labor ally, had sent sexually suggestive messages to a colleague. This resulted in his removal. Opposition to Gillard's government following her misogyny speech intensified. Leadership rivalry continued and Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership spill on 27 June 2013. At the 2013 Election, the Second Rudd Government lost office and the Liberal-National Abbott Government formed.|$|E
25|$|On the June 17 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hogan's {{alliance}} with Abyss {{came to an}} abrupt end when Abyss became a villain. Abyss later claimed that he was controlled by some entity, that was coming to TNA. The next month, Hogan worked with Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe against Sting and Kevin Nash, who claimed that they knew that Hogan and Bischoff were up to something. During this time, Abyss went on a rampage, attacking Rob Van Dam to the point that he was forced to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and eventually put his hands on TNA president Dixie Carter, which led to her signing the paperwork, presented by Bischoff, that would have Abyss fired from TNA following his match with Van Dam at Bound for Glory. Hogan was set <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> Jarrett and Joe against Sting, Nash and D'Angelo Dinero at Bound for Glory, but was forced to miss the event due to a back surgery. However, he would make an appearance {{at the end of the}} event, turning villain for the first time since 2002, helping Jeff Hardy win the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship and aligning himself with Hardy, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett. On the following episode of Impact!, it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked Carter and the paperwork she had signed a week earlier, were not to release Abyss, but to turn the company over to him and Hogan. Meanwhile, Bischoff's and Hogan's new stable, now known as Immortal, formed an alliance with Ric Flair's Fortune. Dixie Carter returned on the November 25 episode of Reaction, informing Hogan and Bischoff that a judge had filed an injunction against the two on her behalf over not having signatory authority, indefinitely suspending Hogan from TNA. During his absence, Hogan underwent a potentially career–ending spinal fusion surgery on December 21, 2010.|$|E

500|$|Michael Crichton {{originally}} conceived {{a screenplay}} about {{a graduate student}} who recreates a dinosaur; he continued <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel Jurassic Park. Even before publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ER. Spielberg considered that what really fascinated him was that Jurassic Park was [...] "a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie.|$|E

500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent {{particularly}} praised Smith, {{stating that}} he [...] "excels in his acting, managing to be reassuring and threatening, hilarious and sinister all {{within the same}} few scenes". However, though she praised the cliffhanger, she thought it [...] "eclipsed" [...] the episode. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern thought that there were [...] "points of logic" [...] which might be questioned, but they were [...] "minor points <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> in a largely polished production". Keith Phipps, reviewing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B and called it a [...] "pretty good follow-up".|$|E
500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club issued the episode a B+ grade, {{and felt that}} the episode was superior {{to those of the}} show's first season. He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or not, tonight is a good time to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|On the April 13 {{episode of}} Raw, Hardy was drafted to the Raw brand {{as part of}} the WWE draft. Despite the fact that the two were on {{different}} brands, he continued his feud with Jeff. Two weeks later, in a rematch from WrestleMania, Hardy lost to Jeff in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at Backlash, in which he legitimately broke his hand. Hardy continued <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> his hand in a cast, incorporating it into his persona and claiming that he was wrestling under protest. He reignited his feud with MVP on Raw again for the United States Championship; this time with Hardy as the heel. He also formed a tag team with William Regal, and the two acted as henchmen for General Manager Vickie Guerrero. At the June 22 taping of WWE Superstars, Hardy suffered yet another injury, when his intestines [...] "exploded" [...] through his abdominal wall, during a triple threat match against MVP and Kofi Kingston. Hardy had suffered a tear in his abdominal muscle two years previously, but had not needed surgery until it worsened, and became a danger to his health.|$|E

Clark also served in World War I {{on the front}} line in France in 1917, earning the Military Medal for his deeds.

500|$|David Goodman comments, {{regarding}} the plot partially following Herbert that [...] "there {{is always a}} bit of trouble pitching a Herbert storyline to the network." [...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's just sitting there right now, {{but you know what}} the great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|E
500|$|Belt {{begins to}} act irrationally then collapses {{screaming}} as he hears {{mention of the}} ghostlike entity from the astronauts. Paramedics are called to attend to him, and find him cowering under his desk whimpering and begging for help. Before Belt is taken away, he tells the agents that the shuttle will not survive reentry due to sabotage by 'the face', which had lived inside his body and possessed him since his time in orbit. At his urging, they alert the shuttle to change its trajectory and are just able to land it successfully. In the hospital, Belt continues <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the presence, telling Mulder he wasn't responsible but also couldn't stop it, as [...] "it came to me, it lives in me". Eventually, in a last wrestle with the re-possessing entity, he shouts [...] "no more" [...] as he leaps from the window to his death - experiencing a lengthy flashback to his last space mission as he falls. Mulder theorizes that, while Belt was compelled to sabotage the launches by the entity possessing him, {{he was also the}} one who sent Generoo the evidence of what was taking place. He lauds Belt's final sacrifice, stating that in the end he gave his life for the mission, as befits a true astronaut.|$|E
500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, throw it in the air and see where it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E

500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist {{in the here and now}} and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E
500|$|Nuclear {{physicists}} {{knew about}} fission, {{but not the}} hydrodynamics of conventional explosions. As a result, there were two additions to the team that made significant contributions {{in this area of}} physics. First was James Tuck whose field of expertise was in shaped charges used in anti tank weapons for armour piercing. In terms of the plutonium bomb the scientists at Los Alamos were trying <b>to</b> <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the idea of the implosion issue. Tuck was sent to Los Alamos in April 1944 and used a radical concept of explosive lensing which was then put into place. Tuck also designed the Urchin initiator for the bomb working closely with Seth Neddermeyer. This work was crucial {{to the success of the}} plutonium atomic bomb: Italian-American scientist Bruno Rossi later stated that without Tuck's work the plutonium bomb could not have exploded in August 1945. The other was Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an important consultant who arrived a month later to also work on the issue. Taylor's presence was desired so much at Los Alamos, Chadwick informed London, [...] "that anything short of kidnapping would be justified". He was sent, and provided crucial insights into the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The acute need for scientists with an understanding of explosives also led Chadwick to obtain the release of William Penney from the Admiralty, and William Marley from the Road Research Laboratory. Peierls and Fuchs worked on the hydrodynamics of the explosive lenses. Bethe considered Fuchs [...] "one of the most valuable men in my division" [...] and [...] "one of the best theoretical physicists we had." ...|$|E
