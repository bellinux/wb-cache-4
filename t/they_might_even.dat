25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (<b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E

2500|$|The Family Compact was a small, tightly knit {{group of}} men who {{dominated}} the government of Upper Canada and the financial and religious institutions associated with it. They were the leading members of the administration: executive councillors, legislative councillors, senior officials and {{some members of the}} judiciary. Their administrative roles, however, were intimately tied to their business activities: [...] "they were not a political elite taking political decisions in a vacuum, but an overlapping elite whose political and economic activities cannot be entirely separated from each other. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> be called 'entrepreneurs', most of whose political views may have been highly conservative but whose economic outlook was clearly 'developmental'."

Scoble first considered them to be a hitherto unrecognised group of butterflies and also suggested Hedylidae might possibly constitute the sister group of the [...] "true" [...] butterflies (Papilionoidea), rather than of (Hesperioidea + Papilionoidea). Weintraub and Miller argued against this placement (but see). In 1995, Weller and Pashley found that molecular data did indeed place Hedylidae with the butterflies and a more comprehensive study in 2005 based on 57 exemplar taxa, three genes and 99 morphological characters, recovered the genus Macrosoma as sister to the ("true butterflies" [...] + [...] "skippers"). However, the most recent phylogenetic analyses shows that skippers are true butterflies belonging within the clade Papilionoidea, whereas the hedylids are a sister group that may be {{closely related to the}} obtectomeran moths. This is contrary to some earlier studies that had shown both the skippers and hedylids as being nested within the Papilionoidea.|$|E

2500|$|After {{its premiere}} at the Venice Film Festival, it {{received}} mixed reviews. Some news sources reported that [...] "critics were completely divided on their opinions". When nine {{reviews of the}} critics who had seen the film in Venice were tabulated, The Huffington Post gave the film the overall critical score of D. Steve Pond of Reuters theorised that W.E. probably would not help in [...] "turning Madonna's faltering movie career". Kyle Buchanan of New York wondered whether W.E. would receive any significant film related awards, as predicted by industry prognosticators. He concluded that the film [...] "still may , but to judge {{from some of the}} vicious pans coming out of Venice today, it might have longer legs as a Razzie front-runner." [...] Daily Mails Baz Bamigboye gave the film a mostly positive review, saying that [...] "A lot of people will loathe it, simply because it’s been made by Madonna. But if people were to watch it with no knowledge of who directed, they would be pleasantly surprised. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> find much of it enjoyable." [...] David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph gave the film three stars and a mixed review stating that, [...] "Madonna's W.E. is a bold and confident story about an American woman's obsession with the Windsors." [...] Gritten complimented Riseborough and Cornish's acting but felt that the film looked like a commercial of expensive items, thus making it appeal to younger women for its fashion portrayal.|$|E
2500|$|The series utilises several {{techniques}} {{from the}} stage and theatre and converting them to the screen. [...] The series frequently breaks the fourth wall (purposely...and, usually, at least once per episode), as well as employing other stylised, cinematic devices such as cutaway scenes shot in a different style {{from the rest of}} the show. For example, in several episodes characters appear to [...] "stop time", interacting with other actors that remain frozen in place, while key members of the cast announce their intentions to us (the audience) or further develop their [...] "con" [...] between themselves and other characters by discussing plans with either each other—or even themselves; while certain members freeze in place, others of the cast are free to move around the set and drink other peoples drinks and pilfer other peoples pockets and the like. [...] This technique serves many purposes—chiefly of which is a stylistic approach to theater, but it can also be said that it is used here as a metaphor for how the main characters of this drama can manipulate their environment at will—as opposed to average individuals who, most of the time, remain oblivious to what is going on around them. Examples of this can be seen in the pilot episode ("The Con Is On"), the first episode of the second series ("Gold Mine") and the second episode of the fourth series ("Signing Up to Wealth"). Other fourth-wall-breaking moments are more subtle – a character might smile directly at the camera as the con begins to take shape, or an actor may make an editorial comment to the viewers, or <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> wink at us...as if we are in on it with them, or they are letting us in on a secret. Some episodes insert fantasy sequences – scenes shot like a Bollywood musical or a silent movie, for example, all well-known cinematic style choices used to elicit emotions or mood from the audience in just a few steps that might, otherwise, take up pages of dialogue in order to accomplish.|$|E
