[...] They married in the Dominican Republic in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards. The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active."

500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a pop, doo-wop and R song {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and four seconds.

In an interview with Popjustice's Peter Robinson, Trainor said: [...] "It's my lil' list of things he should probably be aware of if he wants <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> <b>me.</b> You need to take me on a date, bring me flowers every anniversary.

500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together.

In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional.

2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> <b>me,</b> as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E
