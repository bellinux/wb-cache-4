In this paper, we focus on two common qualitative methods for conducting acceptability research and their advantages and disadvantages: focus groups and interviews. |We provide examples from our own research and other studies to demonstrate the use of these methods for conducting acceptability research and how one might adapt this approach for oral health research. |We present emerging methods for conducting acceptability research, including the use of community-based participatory research, as well as the utility of conducting acceptability research {{for assessing the}} appropriateness of measures in intervention research.

30|$|Somewhat related is the Capture-Recapture method, which samples a {{specific}} <b>target</b> <b>population</b> {{at a certain}} place and repeats the sampling at a later stage (cf. Berry, 2007). Through the calculation {{of the percentage of}} persons selected in both samples, the size of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> can be estimated. This method can be used to estimate the size of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> but not so much for creating a probability sample of sub-populations. Another method based on location sampling was employed to survey migrants in China through pre-defined geographical locations identified through GPS data. Locations were randomly sampled and interviews conducted, which gave better results than those obtained from the census (Landry & Shen, 2005). This method, again, is more appropriate to estimate the size of the <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> but not for creating a probability sample.|$|R

30|$|Completely {{different}} is the approach used by Snowball Samples or Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS), which {{rely on the}} network structure of a <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> It is assumed that all persons of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> are linked through social contacts and therefore {{every member of the}} <b>target</b> <b>population</b> can (in theory) be reached through referral chains of other members of the target group. Selection through referral chains entails selecting first a number of individuals of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> (through any of a multiplicity of possible methods), and subsequently selecting additional members of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> who are identified through references made by the initial (or ‘seed’) respondents. At every subsequent stage every respondent is asked to refer to another person of the <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> Snowball sampling, which is today often considered a form of convenience sample, was originally developed for studying networks by Goodman (1961). RDS was specifically developed to makes inferences on certain hard-to-reach groups by Heckathorn and colleagues (see Heckathorn, 1997 and other references at www.respondentdrivensampling.org, accessed on 24 March 2016). RDS assumes that all members of a <b>target</b> <b>population</b> are linked through social contacts and therefore have a non-zero probability of being included in the sample if selected through chain referral methods. In addition, it assumes that the likelihood of selection of a respondent by an already selected respondent (or referee) is not influenced by whom the referee has been selected. For example, assuming that there are three individuals: A, B and C. A has named B and B has named C. The assumption is that the likelihood of selection of C is not influenced by A having selected B. This means that the selection propensities of respondents remain stable over several waves (i.e. a Markov Chain). If this assumption holds, the selection procedure converges in the end, which allows estimating the selection probabilities. RDS has been used for surveying immigrants, but the success of the method depends on several factors and assumptions, which are difficult to evaluate (Gile, Johnston, & Salganik, 2015). The method can also fail when an insufficient number of references to other members of the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> are made.|$|R

30|$|For the {{representativity}} of {{the analytical}} sample to this <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> several assumptions must hold among which (a) missing data {{on any of}} the analytical variables must be completely at random and (b) the distribution of weights in the sample is invariant to this change in the <b>target</b> <b>population</b> (i.e. the sampling strata are not affected by this change in the definition of the population).|$|R

As a result, a revised <b>target</b> <b>population</b> of 70,000 was set. However, the 2011 census still only shows about 52,000 residents.|$|R

To limit survey access to the <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> the survey was distributed through organisations related closely to the MEM industries. Links to the survey were shared through newsletters or mailing lists of the organisations, for example, INNOVATION NETWORK, SWISS ENGINEERING and INDUSTRIE 2025.
