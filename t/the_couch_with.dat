5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, the two aliens Kang and Kodos {{introduce}} a variety show, {{with a live}} audience consisting of aliens. While they tell jokes, canned laughter is played, but the audience appears unamused.

500|$|Jason {{has also}} been {{referenced}} by several television shows. The stop motion animated television show Robot Chicken features Jason in three of its comedy sketches. In episode seventeen, [...] "", the mystery-solving teenagers from Scooby-Doo arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are killed off one by one. Velma is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In episode nineteen, [...] "That Hurts Me", Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of [...] "Horror Movie Big Brother", alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Pinhead, and Ghostface. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical Friday the 13th. Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of Family Guy entitled [...] "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One". The so-called [...] "Mr. Voorhees" [...] explains to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as {{the manager of the}} [...] "Britches and Hose" [...] clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up. In an episode of The Simpsons, Jason appears in a Halloween episode sitting on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks where the family is, Jason responds, [...] "Ehh, whaddya gonna do?" [...] and turns the TV on. He also appears in The Simpsons episode [...] "Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot!", alongside Pinhead, menacing Bart in a fantasy sequence. The South Park episodes [...] "Imaginationland EpisodeII" [...] and [...] "III" [...] feature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an inhabitant of the [...] "bad side" [...] of Imaginationland, a world populated by fictional characters. This version of Jason has an effeminate voice and describes the removal of Strawberry Shortcake's eyeball as [...] "super hardcore". Experimental pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Jason Voorhees out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his [...] "Totally Sweet" [...] series in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|On November 22, 2011, Toni Annette Medrano accidentally {{killed her}} 3-week-old son, Adrian Alexander Medrano, {{while she was}} {{sleeping}} on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> him. According to the criminal complaint, Medrano told police she had consumed almost an entire fifth of vodka the night before her son died and fell asleep {{with him on a}} couch. The following morning, she woke up and found her infant son unresponsive and cold to the touch. While Grace was covering the case, she infamously dubbed Medrano [...] "Vodka Mom". During one of her shows, Grace brought a bottle of vodka onto her set and poured shots to demonstrate how much Medrano had drunk the night of her son's death. In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of ten years in prison.|$|E
