5000|$|HA and HI {{apply the}} process of hemagglutination, in which sialic acid receptors {{on the surface of}} red blood cells (RBCs) bind to the {{hemagglutinin}} glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza virus (and several other viruses) and create a network, or lattice structure, of interconnected RBC’s and virus particles. [...] The agglutinated lattice maintains the RBC’s in a suspended distribution, typically viewed as a diffuse reddish solution. The formation of the lattice depends on the concentrations of the virus and RBC’s, and when the relative virus concentration is too low, the RBC’s are not constrained by the lattice and settle {{to the bottom of the}} well. Hemagglutination is observed in the presence of staphylococci, vibrios, and other bacterial species, similar to the mechanism viruses use to cause agglutination of erythrocytes. The RBC’s used in HA and HI assays are typically from chickens, turkeys, horses, guinea pigs, or humans depending on the selectivity of the <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> or bacterium and the associated surface receptors on the RBC.|$|E

50|$|A subunit vaccine {{presents}} an antigen to {{the immune system}} without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins can be denatured and will then become associated with antibodies different from the desired antibodies. A second method of making a subunit vaccine involves putting an antigen's gene from the <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> or bacterium into another virus (virus vector), yeast (yeast vector) {{in the case of}} the hepatitis B vaccine or attenuated bacterium (bacterial vector) to make a recombinant virus or bacteria to serve as the important component of a recombinant vaccine (called a recombinant subunit vaccine). The recombinant vector that is genomically modified will express the antigen. The antigen (one or more subunits of protein) is extracted from the vector. Just like the highly successful subunit vaccines, the recombinant-vector-produced antigen will be of little to no risk to the patient. This is the type of vaccine currently in use for hepatitis B, and it is experimentally popular, being used to try to develop new vaccines for difficult-to-vaccinate-against viruses such as ebolavirus and HIV.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} broad cell- and tissue-tropism, alphavirus-based replication-competent vectors are of {{particular}} interest for anti-cancer therapy. These properties may, however, be potentially hazardous unless the virus infection is controlled. While the RNA genome of alphaviruses precludes the standard control techniques, host miRNAs {{can be used to}} down-regulate viral replication. In this study, target sites from ubiquitous miRNAs and those of miRNAs under-represented in cervical cancer cells were inserted into replication-competent DNA/RNA layered vectors of Semliki Forest virus. It was found that in order to achieve the most efficient suppression of recombinant virus rescue, the introduced target sequences must be fully complementary to those of the corresponding miRNAs. Target sites of ubiquitous miRNAs, introduced into the 3 ' untranslated region of the viral vector, profoundly reduced the rescue of recombinant viruses. Insertion of the same miRNA targets into coding region of the viral vector was approximately 300 -fold less effective. Viruses carrying these miRNAs were genetically unstable and rapidly lost the target sequences. This process was delayed, but not completely prevented, by miRNA inhibitors. Target sites of miRNA under-represented in cervical cancer cells had much smaller but still significant effects on recombinant virus rescue in cervical cancer-derived HeLa cells. Over-expression of miR- 214, one of these miRNAs, reduced replication of the <b>targeted</b> <b>virus.</b> Though the majority of rescued viruses maintained the introduced miRNA target sequences, genomes with deletions of these sequences were also detected. Thus, the low-level repression of rescue and replication of <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> in HeLa cells was still sufficient to cause genetic instability...|$|E
40|$|Background: Viruses are {{incredibly}} diverse organisms and impact {{all forms of}} life on Earth; however, individual virions are challenging to study due to their small size and mass, precluding almost all direct imaging or molecular analysis. Moreover, like microbes, {{the overwhelming majority of}} viruses cannot be cultured, impeding isolation, replication, and study of interesting new species. Here, we introduce PCR-activated virus sorting, a method to isolate specific viruses from a heterogeneous population. Specific sorting opens new avenues in the study of uncultivable viruses, including recovering the full genomes of viruses based on genetic fragments in metagenomes, or identifying the hosts of viruses. Methods: PAVS enables specific sorting of viruses with flow cytometry. A sample containing a virus population is processed through a microfluidic device to encapsulate it into droplets, such that the droplets contain different viruses from the sample. TaqMan PCR reagents are also included <b>targeting</b> specific <b>virus</b> species such that, upon thermal cycling, droplets containing the species become fluorescent.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to elucidate the mechanism of virus recognition in molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) using already utilized techniques. The clinical relevance of this study relates {{to the development of a}} virus imprinted MIP, which would apply to the identification, classification, and removal of viruses. The separation of viruses and virus-like particles from various media represents an enormous challenge to the fields of medicine, healthcare, and biotechnology. Since virus MIPs must function in aqueous environments, our approach employs a more flexible non-covalent imprinting method which starts from a readily available polymer and utilizes an aqueous environment for both MIP synthesis and testing. Crosslinked polymers imprinted against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) via non-covalent interactions were synthesized using poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAA), epichlorohydrin (EPI), and TMV. The TMV imprinted polymer exhibited an increase affinity to the target virus compared to the control polymer and demonstrated a preferential affinity (imprinting factor of 2. 1), based on shape, to the target virus compared to a non-target virus, Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV). In contrast, there was no significant increase in binding of the control polymer to either target or non-target virus. Once it was determined that virus imprinted polymers can be successfully synthesized having preferential binding to a <b>targeted</b> <b>virus,</b> the synthesis procedure was optimized to obtain better binding characteristics to the <b>targeted</b> <b>virus.</b> Efforts were made to avoid polymer-template aggregation in the MIP pre-polymerization mixture, and determine a proper wash solution by the ability to remove the templated virus from the crosslinked polymer. TMV imprinted hydrogels were synthesized using an optimized procedure and binding test performed on these MIPs to determine binding capacity, and more importantly, imprinting factor. The highest imprinting factor of 2. 3 resulted from the MIP composed of 35 % PAA at pH 7, 15 %, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE), and 0. 4 mg/mL TMV. The TMV imprinted hydrogels exhibited a lower binding capacity to TNV than when exposed to TMV.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, the {{antiviral}} activity of brequinar (BQR) against the replication of Cantagalo virus was evaluated. BQR {{is a potent}} inhibitor of cellular dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Infection {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 μM BQR reduced virus progeny production by > 90 %, revealing an EC 50 (drug concentration required to inhibit 50 % of virus replication) of 0. 017 μM. Replication of other orthopoxviruses was also inhibited by BQR at similar levels. In the presence of the drug, virus early proteins accumulated to control levels, whereas late gene expression was severely impaired. This result was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays and analysis of time-regulated expression of a reporter gene under the control of a virus promoter. Both assays revealed nearly 90 % inhibition of late gene expression. BQR also blocked virus DNA replication, which accounted for the subsequent inhibition of virus late gene expression. The ablation of virus DNA replication, late gene expression and infectious progeny production was restored to control levels when infected cells were co-treated with uridine (URD) and BQR. These data demonstrated that BQR <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> DNA synthesis by depleting the cellular pyrimidine pool, which was bypassed by the salvage pathway when URD was added to the cell cultures...|$|E

40|$|Development of rapid, {{sensitive}} and specific methods for detection of infectious enteric viruses in water is challenging but crucial for gaining reliable information for risk assessment. An immunocapture real-time PCR (IC-qPCR) {{was designed to}} detect jointly the two major viral particle components, i. e. the capsid protein and the viral genome. Targeting both constituents helps circumventing the technical limits of cell culture approaches and the inability of PCR based methods to predict the infectious status. Two waterborne pathogenic virus models, human adenovirus types 2 and 41, were chosen for this study. IC-qPCR showed a detection limit of 10 MPNCU/reaction with a dynamic range from 102 to 106 MPNCU/reaction. Sensitivity was thus 100 -fold higher compared to ELISA-based capture employing the same anti-hexon antibodies. After optimisation, application on environmental water samples was validated, and specificity towards the <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> types was obtained through the qPCR step. Heat-treated pure samples as well as surface water samples brought evidence that this method achieves detection of encapsidated viral genomes while excluding free viral genome amplification.

Here, we present an alternative strategy for creating virus-resistant cells and animals by ectopic expression of a nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic 3 D 8 {{single chain variable fragment}} (scFv), which has both DNase and RNase activities. HeLa cells (SCH 07072) [corrected] expressing 3 D 8 scFv acquired significant resistance to DNA viruses. Virus challenging with Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 3 D 8 scFv transgenic cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay based on direct DNA cleavage analysis revealed that the induced resistance in HeLa cells was acquired by the nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic activity of 3 D 8 scFv. In addition, pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in WT C 57 BL/ 6 mice was lethal, whereas transgenic mice (STG 90) that expressed high levels of 3 D 8 scFv mRNA in liver, muscle, and brain showed a 56 % survival rate 5 days after PRV intramuscular infection. The antiviral effects against DNA viruses conferred by 3 D 8 scFv expression in HeLa cells as well as an in vivo mouse system {{can be attributed to the}} nuclease activity that inhibits viral genome DNA replication in the nucleus and/or viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm.

The use of convalescent-phase human plasma is an effective treatment in humans infected with arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Despite this, little work has focused on developing potent and defined immunotherapeutics against arenaviruses. In the present study, we produced arenavirus neutralizing antibodies by DNA vaccination of rabbits with plasmids encoding the full-length glycoprotein precursors of Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV). Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers, {{as measured by the}} 50 % plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50), exceeded 5, 000 against homologous viruses. Antisera against each <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> exhibited limited cross-species binding and, to a lesser extent, cross-neutralization. Anti-JUNV glycoprotein rabbit antiserum protected Hartley guinea pigs from lethal intraperitoneal infection with JUNV strain Romero when the antiserum was administered 2 days after challenge and provided some protection (∼ 30 %) when administered 4 days after challenge. Treatment starting on day 6 did not protect animals. We further formulated an IgG antibody cocktail by combining anti-JUNV, -MACV, and -GTOV antibodies produced in DNA-vaccinated rabbits.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transductional {{targeting}} of adenovirus following systemic or regional delivery {{remains one of}} the most difficult challenges for cancer gene medicine. The numerical excess and anatomical advantage of normal (non-cancer) cells in vivo demand far greater detargeting than is necessary for studies using single cell populations in vitro, and this must be coupled with efficient retargeting to cancer cells. METHODS: Adenovirus (Ad 5) particles were coated with reactive poly[N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] copolymers, to achieve detargeting, and retargeting ligands were attached to the coating. Receptor-mediated infection was characterised in vitro and anticancer efficacy was studied in vivo. RESULTS: Polymer coating prevented the virus binding any cellular receptors and mediated complete detargeting in vitro and in vivo. These fully detargeted vectors were efficiently retargeted with the model ligand FGF 2 to infect FGFR-positive cells. Specific transduction activity was the same as parental virus, and intracellular routing appeared unaffected. Levels of transduction were up to 100 -fold greater than parental virus on CAR negative cells. This level of specificity permitted good efficacy in intraperitoneal cancer virotherapy, simultaneously decreasing peritoneal adhesions seen with parental virus. Following intravenous delivery FGF 2 mediated unexpected binding to erythrocytes, improving circulation kinetics, but preventing the <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> from leaving the blood stream. CONCLUSIONS: Polymer cloaking enables complete adenovirus detargeting, providing a versatile platform for receptor-specific retargeting. This approach can efficiently retarget cancer virotherapy in vivo. Ligands should be selected carefully, as non-specific interactions with non-target cells (e. g. blood cells) can deplete the pool of therapeutic virus available for targeting disseminated disease...|$|E

The distribution of virus applied onto and within the coupons was characterized, and the repeatability of applying a <b>targeted</b> <b>virus</b> load was examined. The average viable virus loaded onto 90 coupons over the course of 5 days was found to be 5. 09 ± 0. 19 log 10 PFU/coupon (relative standard deviation, 4 %). To determine the ability to differentiate the effectiveness of disinfecting procedures with different levels of performance, sodium hypochlorite and steam treatments were tested in experiments by varying the dose and time, respectively. The role of protective factors was assessed by aerosolizing the virus with various concentrations of the aerosol-generating medium. A sodium hypochlorite (bleach) concentration of 0. 6 % and steam treatments of 45 s and longer resulted in log reductions (> 4 logs) which reached the detection limits for both levels of protective factors. Organic matter (ATCC medium 271) as a protective factor afforded some protection to the virus in the sodium hypochlorite experiments but was not a factor in the steam experiments.
