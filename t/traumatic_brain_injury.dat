5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion.

It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injury,</b> spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism.

Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E

5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> It is {{typically}} defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{challenges}} faced worldwide is the so-called “ageing population” phenomenon. Besides the disabilities and illnesses that the elderly is prone to, <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> represent a common and potentially fatal factor that greatly affects this population.

Current solutions and devices for head injury prevention are limited and from a design point of view there is space for improvements.

All <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> are head injuries, but the latter term may also refer to injury {{to other parts of the}} head.

Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E

40|$|Objective and design: Long-term {{consequences}} of mild <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> were investigated {{based on a}} 10 -year follow-up of patients from a previously published randomized controlled study of mild <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injuries.</b> One aim was to describe changes over time after mild <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> {{in terms of the}} extent of persisting post-concussion symptoms, life satisfaction, perceived health, activities of daily living, changes in life roles and sick leave. Another aim was to identify differences between the intervention and control groups. Patients: The intervention group comprised 142 persons and the control group 56 persons. Methods: Postal questionnaires with a response rate of 56 %. Results: No differences over time were found for the intervention and control groups in terms of post-concussion symptoms. In the intervention group some variables in life satisfaction, perceived health and daily life were decreased. Some roles had changed over the years for both groups. No other differences between the intervention and control groups were found. However, in both groups sick leave decreased. Conclusion: Early individual intervention by a qualified rehabilitation team does not appear to impact on the long-term outcome for persons with symptoms related to mild <b>traumatic</b> <b>brain</b> <b>injuries.</b> The status after approximately 3 weeks is indicative of the status after 10 years. ...|$|R
