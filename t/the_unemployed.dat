On arrival, Brownell accepted a commission in the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF).

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and <b>the</b> <b>unemployed.</b> A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E

The analysis follows causal relationship in the theory and attempts to test it empirically. There is therefore an examination of how economic incentives influence <b>the</b> <b>unemployeds</b> work preferences, search behavior and integration in the labor market. The report is based on quantitative data and searchs to find general trends. In the analysis the focusing is on whether there are specific characteristics and factors about the job, which influence {{the impact of the}} economic incentive. Further on it is discussed whether the empirical findings give rise to a reassessment of the search theory...|$|R

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>unemployed</b> would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their white counterparts. To aid <b>the</b> <b>unemployed,</b> the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E

40|$|Using the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey, {{this brief}} {{outlines}} the demographic and economic characteristics of <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> and compares {{them with their}} short-term unemployed counterparts. It also describes changes {{in the composition of}} <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> since <b>the</b> start of the Great Recession. Author Andrew Schaefer reports that <b>the</b> percentage of <b>unemployed</b> workers who were seeking employment for more than six months more than doubled between 2007 and 2013 from 18. 4 percent to 39. 3 percent and that <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> are more likely than <b>the</b> short-term <b>unemployed</b> to live in urban areas. In addition, <b>the</b> urban long-term <b>unemployed</b> {{are more likely to be}} older, but less likely to be poor than their rural counterparts. He concludes that, as debate about the extension of Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits continues, it is important to gain an understanding of <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> in terms of their demographic and economic characteristics and how those characteristics differ across place in order to help better target strategies for alleviating the negative effects of long-term unemployment...|$|R

The Medical Relief Disqualification Removal Act 1885 meant that people who had accessed medical care funded by the poor rate were no longer disqualified from voting in elections. In 1886 the Chamberlain Circular encouraged the Local Government Board to set up work projects when unemployment rates were high rather than use workhouses. In 1905 the Conservatives passed <b>the</b> <b>Unemployed</b> Workman Act which provided for temporary employment for workers in times of unemployment.|$|E
5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular <b>the</b> <b>unemployed</b> ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, King Kamehameha IV declared the Kingdom of Hawaii's neutrality on August26, 1861. Despite this stance of neutrality, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands acted independently and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more fought during the American Civil War. There were varying reasons for joining the war. Hawaiians abroad often sought economic gains and adventures through their enlistment. These included <b>the</b> <b>unemployed</b> sailors on whaling ships who joined the Union Navy and sailors on whaling ships captured by the Confederate Navy who served on the CSS Shenandoah. There was also an ideological sympathy for the cause of the war. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to New England through missionaries and the whaling industry, and the opposition of many people in the islands to slavery.|$|E
40|$|University’s Work Trends Survey {{indicate}} that <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> have a 20 to 40 percent lower probability of being employed 1 to 2 {{years in the}} future than do <b>the</b> short-term <b>unemployed.</b> In comparison with <b>the</b> short-term <b>unemployed,</b> for <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> <b>the</b> job finding rate is less sensi-tive to the state of the business cycle, but their labor force withdrawal rate is more procyclical. A calibration exercise finds that the tendency of the labor force withdrawal rate of <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> to decline in a recession and then rise in a recovery {{plays an important role in}} the well-documented loop around the Beveridge curve. Overall, the results suggest that the longer work-ers are <b>unemployed,</b> <b>the</b> less attached they become to the labor market. A number of observers have noted that in recent years conventional Phillips curve and Beveridge curve models have predicted greater price deflation, greater real wage declines, and fewer vacancies than actu-ally occurred as a result of the high rate of unemployment experienced during the Great Recession and its aftermath. Several economists have pro-vided possible explanations for the missed predictions of the Phillips curve...|$|R

The introduction of training reverses the optimal consumption dynamics during the unemployment spell and makes it optimal to incentivize <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed</b> to nd employment despite the depreciation of their human capital. Targeting training programs towards <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed,</b> however, is optimal only if the fall in human capital upon displacement is small relative to the depreciation during unemployment...|$|R
40|$|We empirically {{investigate}} how two-tier unemployment compensation schemes affect {{the profile of}} re-employment hazards. We exploit the aggravation of an existing two-tier scheme in Germany in 2005 and estimate its impact on re-employment rates at different durations. For <b>the</b> short-term <b>unemployed,</b> <b>the</b> hazard rate increases and negative duration dependence declines. For <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed,</b> we find none and for certain groups of job seekers even negative impacts on the re-employment hazard. Our results indicate that two-tier unemployment compensation schemes might create a long-term unemployment trap: If employers rank applicants by their duration in unemployment, incentivizing all job seekers to exert higher search efforts may reduce the reemployment probabilities for <b>the</b> long-term <b>unemployed...</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and <b>the</b> <b>unemployed</b> Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. <b>The</b> <b>unemployed,</b> outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that <b>the</b> <b>unemployed</b> were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E
