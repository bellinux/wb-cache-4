25|$|Experimentally it is {{seen that}} the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing {{evidence}} for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory.|$|E
500|$|Dirac {{described}} the quantization {{of the electromagnetic}} field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators {{with the introduction of}} the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, Werner Heisenberg and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, {{it would be possible to}} perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, [...] in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics.|$|E
30|$|By observing <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{different}} subscales, it {{is observed}} that the most of them exceed the value of 0.60 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1995). Although Cronbach’s alpha is not recommended when there are only two items, <b>the</b> low <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceptance is reiterated in several studies. For this reason, it is recommended to exclude it from the analyses when its alpha value is less than 0.60.|$|R
30|$|Although {{the subscales}} {{contained}} {{only a few}} items, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation-specific subscales of motivation were all acceptable. The invested effort subscale assessed students’ test-taking motivation defined according to Baumert and Demmrich’s ([2001]) definition—willingness to engage on test items. We assigned the other subscales to the test-related facets (test attractiveness, usefulness of the test) and to the person-related facets (emotional state, worry, distraction) of test-taking motivation.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> {{reliability}} <b>of</b> {{each subscale}} {{was assessed using}} Cronbach’s coefficient alpha; values above 0.70 were considered adequate (Terwee et al. 2007).|$|R
2500|$|The {{accession}} to the UCC caused a dual system in Soviet copyright law, with {{the effect that}} foreign works published after May 27, 1973, were actually granted a stronger copyright protection than Soviet works because for foreign works {{the definition of the}} UCC of [...] "publication" [...] applied, which was narrower than the definition of [...] "publication" [...] in Soviet law, which continued to be applied to Soviet works. The duality was also emphasized by the new licensing scheme. In the years following the {{accession to}} the UCC, considerable doctrinal confusion ensued amongst Soviet scholars on how to reconcile such dual treatment with the Soviet ideology or ideals. Scholars proposed further changes and clarifications beyond the changes necessary to conform to the UCC. Elst concludes that the accession to the UCC questioned <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> Soviet law and undermined several of its basic principles, and that the myriad of improvement suggestions by scholars actually caused new legal uncertainties.|$|E
2500|$|For many believers, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the Jewish and Christian scriptures is {{important}} because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin. On {{the subject of the}} Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the Torah that [...] "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the Hebrew Bible or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that [...] "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected rabbinic leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies." [...] However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this [...] "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the NEO scales was {{assessed}} on 1,539 individuals. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the NEO PI-R was high, at: N = [...]92, E = [...]89, O = [...]87, A = [...]86, C = [...]90. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the facet scales ranged from [...]56 to [...]81. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the NEO PI-3 {{was consistent with}} that of the NEO PI-R, with α ranging from [...]89 to [...]93 for the five domains. Internal consistency coefficient from the facets, with each facet scale comprising fewer items than each of the Big Five scales, were necessarily smaller, ranging from [...]54 to [...]83.|$|E
30|$|Motivating {{potential}} of work This dimension was surveyed {{at the age}} of 52 with {{a modified version of the}} Job Diagnostic Survey from Hackman and Oldham (1975, considering the modification see Häfeli et al. 1983). The scale consists of the four subscales “skill variety”, “task identity”, “autonomy” and “task significance” with three items each. The response format reached from 1  = “never” to 5  = “always”. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main scale proved to be good (. 77).|$|R
30|$|A {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} is the number of items per subscale. For example, the test usefulness subscale had just one item, while the distraction subscale contained only two. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> these two subscales could be improved by adding further items to them. Due to the restricted testing time and the large number of questions in the student questionnaire, more items could not be implemented. However, good and substantial reliabilities confirmed the homogeneity of these scales.|$|R
30|$|Before {{proceeding}} with the canonical correlation analysis, the study determined {{the extent to}} which the items in the questionnaire were related to each other. In this regard, an overall index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repeatability or <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale as a whole was computed to identify problem items that should be excluded from the scale. The computed Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients were all acceptable, an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> items on the scale.|$|R

40|$|The self-report {{version of}} the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD) has become a popular measure for {{assessing}} psychopathic features in justice-involved adolescents.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} a newly developed student questionnaire {{for the assessment of}} aggressive and non-aggressive student behavior, teacher aggression and disruption of the class setting as well as classroom management and relationship and we focus on the statistical proprieties of the questionnaire. The factor structure of this questionnaire was identified on a sample of 1341 pupils of grades 5 and 6. In an exploratory factor analysis using direct oblimin-rotation, 7 clear factors, which correspond to the theoretical constructs, were obtained.

50|$|Past {{research}} has measured RCSE with a psychological scale consisting of 11 items. The scale contains two related sub-scales: the general Contingent Self-Esteem Scale and the Contingencies of Self-Worth Scale. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> {{the scale is}} high, as is the two-week test-retest reliability.|$|E
50|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the scale, a team which included the original authors found that the original questionnaire contained some irrelevant questions and produced a shortened version of the scale containing 28 items. Principal component analysis indicated that this shortened questionnaire was able to measure empathy reliably.|$|E
50|$|The AHP {{software}} uses mathematical calculations {{to convert}} these judgments to priorities {{for each of}} the four criteria.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> {{reliability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three {{scales in}} NUEPS was determined {{in the study}} by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient for the above sample. The results in Table  2 indicate that <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> reliability ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three NUEPS scales. For the whole scale, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.98, and the half-split reliability of the scale was 0.93. For the ‘STA’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.95, with a half-split reliability of 0.93. For the ‘SRP’, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.95, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Finally, for the ‘LAPI’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.92, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measures used in this study can be considered as favorable.|$|R

5000|$|Objects are {{instances}} of classes. They contain data and provides services. The data forms {{the attributes of}} the object. The services are known as methods (also known as operations or functions). Typically, methods operate on private data (the attributes, or state of the object), which is only visible to the methods of the object. Thus the attributes of an object cannot be changed directly by the user, but only by the methods of the object. This guarantees <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the object.|$|E
50|$|If, {{however, the}} goal of {{mathematical}} ontology is taken to be <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, {{it is more important}} that mathematical objects be definable in some uniform way (for example, as sets) regardless of actual practice, in order to lay bare the essence of its paradoxes.
