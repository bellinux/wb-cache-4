5|$|American counterattacks {{continued}} into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather {{and a lack of}} food and water. The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in <b>the</b> <b>bulge</b> area. By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at <b>the</b> <b>bulge.</b> 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E
5|$|At that point, the {{previously}} consistent phreatic activity had become intermittent.

30|$|The {{strain in}} <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> part can be {{calculated}} from the initial length of the sample and the width of <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> section. We used a relatively linear sample segment in Fig.  5, where the deformation {{appears to have been}} accommodated only by <b>bulging.</b> <b>The</b> difference between the initial sample length (10.2  mm) and the linear segment in Fig.  5 (9.0  mm) gives the initial length of <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> part (1.2  mm). The strain calculated from the initial sample length and the linear segment in the deformed sample is consistent with a total permanent strain of 12 % in the mechanical data, which also uses the initial sample length (Fig.  3). The length of <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> part in <b>the</b> deformed sample corresponds to the width (0.7  mm) of the transparent portion around the top and bottom sample core boundaries. The calculated strain in <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> part determined from the initial length of <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> segment and <b>the</b> length of the transparent portion in the deformed sample is ca. 40 %, which is approximately four times the permanent strain of the sample in the mechanical data (Fig.  3).|$|R

In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, including one on The Ardennes: The Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Bulge.</b> Author Hugh M.

5|$|Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{airborne}} divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Before being deployed to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> in December. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation.

25|$|Orbital decay {{can occur}} due to tidal forces for objects below the {{synchronous}} orbit {{for the body}} they're orbiting. The gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal <b>bulges</b> in <b>the</b> primary, and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface <b>the</b> <b>bulges</b> lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of <b>the</b> <b>bulges</b> is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion. <b>The</b> near <b>bulge</b> slows <b>the</b> object more than <b>the</b> far <b>bulge</b> speeds it up, {{and as a result}} the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on <b>the</b> <b>bulges</b> applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism.

40|$|Magnetization {{processes}} in advanced magnetic nanostructures are investigated. For {{the case of}} spherical soft or semihard grains surrounded by a very hard matrix a bulging nucleation mode is discovered. <b>The</b> <b>bulging</b> mode exhibits <b>the</b> radial angular symmetry of the coherent mode, but it is incoherent due to its radial variation. The radial dependence of <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> mode is obtained by solving a spherical Bessel equation which is subject to appropriate boundary conditions. In contrast to the coherent mode, <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> mode yields a nucleationfield coercivity which depends on the exchange stiffness and {{on the size of}} the grain. There is a critical grain radius 7. 869 √A/μ 0 Ms 2 above which <b>the</b> <b>bulging</b> mode is replaced by a modified curling mode. The nucleation modes realized in nanostructures affect the demagnetizing-field corrections necessary to account for the external shape of magnetic samples. Since strong but short-range exchange and weak but long-range magnetostatic interactions compete on nanostructural length scales, the sample-shape dependence of the hysteresis loops cannot be mapped onto a purely magnetostatic demagnetizing factor...|$|R
5|$|Despite American counterattacks, the North Koreans {{were able}} to {{continue}} pressing forward and take Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in <b>the</b> <b>bulge</b> area. By August 10 the entire NK 4th Division was across the river and beginning to move south, outflanking the American lines. The next day, scattered elements of the North Korean forces attacked Yongsan. The North Korean forces repeatedly attacked US lines at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on <b>the</b> <b>bulge,</b> resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
