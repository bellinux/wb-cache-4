2500|$|Ditransitive verbs are verbs {{that require}} 3 arguments: a subject (or agent), a direct object (or patient, {{sometimes}} also called theme) and an indirect object (or recipient). In English [...] "to give" [...] and [...] "to lend" [...] are typical ditransitive verbs. In Tsez the agent takes the ergative {{and the patient}} takes the absolutive case. The recipient's case depends on the semantic nature of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> or information: if it's a permanent transfer (e.g. [...] "to give (as a present)"), the recipient takes the dative/lative case (ending in -(e)r), if it's a non-permanent transfer (e.g. [...] "to lend") or if it's incomplete, the recipient takes any of the locative cases. Two examples illustrate the difference: ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} may be predicated upon an improper disposal, removal, transportation, delivery, or <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of property to one not {{authorized by the}} owner to receive the property. The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that, with some exceptions, one who makes an unauthorized delivery of a chattel to a person not entitled to its immediate possession is subject to liability for conversion to another who is so entitled. [...] A bailee, agent, or servant who re-delivers to his bailor, principal, or master is not liable for conversion unless the person entitled to immediate possession had made an adverse claim upon him. [...] A bailee, agent or servant who delivers the chattel to a third person pursuant to the instructions of his bailor, principal or master is not liable for conversion unless he has knowledge or reason to know that his bailor, principal, or master is not authorized so to dispose of it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{force or}} fear {{established}} by the defendant must precede the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of the object in question. This can be said, also, as the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> must be acquired {{through the use of}} force or fear as the tool of attaining such goods in order to achieve all aspects of the legal doctrine imposed, [...] "the felonious taking." ...|$|E
50|$|North Dakota has state {{preemption}} {{of firearms}} laws. No political subdivision may enact any ordinance {{relating to the}} purchase, sale, ownership, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> ownership, <b>possession,</b> registration, or licensure of firearms and ammunition which is more restrictive than state law.|$|R
50|$|After the French {{withdrawal}} from India a futile {{attempt was made}} by the Government of India to negotiate with the Portugal for a peaceful <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> its <b>possession</b> to the Indian Union. Consequently, the Goa Action Committee was formed in Bombay to awaken sympathy for its cause within the country and abroad.|$|R
25|$|In May 1942, the {{destroyer}} began helping in the surveillance of Vichy French warships in the Caribbean. To assure that those French ships were not {{turned over to}} the Germans and that, in accordance with the Panama Declaration, there be no <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> European <b>possessions</b> in America to any non-American power, she was assigned a patrol area around Pointe-à-Pitre, Grand Terre Island, Guadeloupe, and her specific charge was the old training cruiser Jeanne D'Arc.|$|R
50|$|Weapons {{other than}} sporting-configuration rifles and {{shotguns}} must be individually registered, and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> {{is subject to}} prior approval by the police.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> is that (unlike the mortgage bond, where possession is usually retained) {{it does not}} promote commerce, as most businesses cannot afford to give up possession of their movable property.|$|E
50|$|Purchase {{and sale}} (emptio venditio) is a mutual {{contract}} for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of a thing {{in exchange for a}} price. It has three essentials: consent (consensus ad idem); a thing sold (merx); and a price (pretium).|$|E
50|$|If a {{third party}} <b>transfers</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> {{property}} to an employee for delivery to his employer, the employee has <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny. For example, if a customer of a bank delivers money to a teller to deposit in the customer’s account, the teller had <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the property and his misappropriation would be embezzlement rather than larceny. However, once the teller <b>transfers</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the money to his employer, by placing {{the money in the}} till for example, the subsequent taking would be larceny rather than embezzlement. This rule does not apply if the teller intending to steal the property places the money in the till merely as a temporary repository or to hide his peculation.|$|R
5000|$|Moonshine is in Sweden {{known as}} hembränt in Swedish (literally [...] "home burnt") with common nicknames like HB and skogsstjärnan ("the forest star") or humorous names like garagenkorva (a pun from [...] "garage" [...] and [...] "Koskenkorva") and Folksprit (booze of the people). As the desired product is a neutral spirit (resembling vodka), the [...] "mash" [...] is {{typically}} {{a mix of}} sugar and yeast in water which gets a simple distillation followed by filtration in activated charcoal after being diluted to 30%-50% ABV as higher strengths lessens {{the efficiency of the}} filtering. Sometimes freeze distillation is used to make apple brandy or other drinks with lower alcohol content. Unlicensed manufacture, <b>transfer</b> and <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> distilled alcohol is illegal in Sweden, as is the manufacture, <b>transfer</b> and <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> stills or parts of stills intended for unlicensed manufacture of alcohol. The manufacture, <b>transfer</b> and <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> mash intended for this purpose is also illegal. [...] Due to relaxed import regulation since 2005, business has declined. Moonshine is most socially accepted in the countryside, where it's produced for own consumption rather than for sale.|$|R
5000|$|Helms was {{a long-time}} {{opponent}} <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the Panama Canal to Panama, calling its construction an [...] "historic American achievement." [...] He warned {{that it would}} {{fall into the hands}} of Omar Torrijos's [...] "communist friends". The issue <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race, wherein then-President Ford suspended negotiations over the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter reopened negotiations, appointing Sol Linowitz as co-negotiator without Senate confirmation, and Helms and Strom Thurmond led the opposition to the transfer. Helms claimed that Linowitz's involvement with Marine Midland constituted a conflict of interests, arguing that it constituted a bailout of American banking interests. He filed two federal suits, demanding prior congressional approval of any treaty and then consent by both houses of Congress. Helms also rallied Reagan, telling him that negotiation over Panama would be a [...] "second Schweiker" [...] as far as his conservative base was concerned.|$|R
50|$|The parties {{must be in}} {{agreement}} that {{the object of the}} contract is to purchase and to sell the res concerned, for the price agreed upon, and that the seller (usually) ensures the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and/or ownership of the res to the buyer.|$|E
50|$|Most {{property}} possessed {{is obtained}} {{with the consent}} of someone else who possessed it. They may have been purchased, received as gifts, leased, or borrowed. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of goods is called delivery. For land, it is common to speak of granting or giving possession.|$|E
50|$|Bailment is {{distinguished}} from a {{contract of sale}} or a gift of property, as it only involves the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and not its ownership. To create a bailment, the bailee must both intend to possess, and actually physically possess, the bailable chattel. Bailment is a typical common law concept although similar concepts exists in civil law (Spain- Depósito).|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Virginia Tech massacre in Blacksburg, Virginia, Kucinich proposed a plan that he said would address violence in America. Kucinich drafted legislation that included a ban on the purchase, sale, <b>transfer,</b> or <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> handguns by civilians.|$|R
5000|$|The Act {{prohibited}} the manufacture, <b>transfer,</b> or <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> [...] "semiautomatic assault weapons" [...] {{as defined by}} the Act. [...] "Weapons banned were identified either by specific make or model (including copies or duplicates thereof, in any caliber), or by specific characteristics that slightly varied according to whether the weapon was a pistol, rifle, or shotgun" [...] (see below). The Act also {{prohibited the}} <b>transfer</b> and <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> [...] "large capacity ammunition feeding devices" [...] (LCAFDs). An LCAFD was defined as [...] "any magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device manufactured after the date the act that has the capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition." ...|$|R
5000|$|... : [...] "Now faith (pi'stis) is the {{assurance}} of things hoped for, {{the conviction of}} things not seen." [...] This passage concerning the function of faith {{in relation to the}} covenant of God is often used as a definition of faith. [...] (hy-po'sta-sis), translated [...] "assurance" [...] here, commonly appears in ancient papyrus business documents, conveying the idea that a covenant is an exchange of assurances which guarantees the future <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possessions</b> described in the contract. In view of this, James Hope Moulton and George Milligan suggest the rendering: [...] "Faith is the title deed of things hoped for" [...] (Vocabulary of the Greek Testament, 1963, p. 660). The Greek word e´leg-khos, rendered [...] "conviction" [...] in Hebrews 11:1 (ESV), conveys the idea of bringing forth evidence that demonstrates something, particularly something contrary to {{what appears to be the}} case. Thereby this evidence makes clear what has not been discerned before and so refutes what has only appeared to be the case. This evidence for conviction is so positive or powerful that it is described as faith. Christian faith, described in these terms, is not synonymous with credulity, but rather has connotations of acting in faithfulness and trust.|$|R
50|$|In {{respect of}} a sale of shares, {{it has been}} held that a {{distinction}} should be made between a transfer of a business as a going concern and a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and control of a business: {{the result of a}} sale of shares. A sale of shares is excluded from the ambit of section 197.|$|E

5000|$|A {{bill of lading}} is a standard-form {{document}} that is transferable by endorsement (or by lawful <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession).</b> [...] Most shipments by sea are covered by the Hague Rules, the Hague-Visby Rules or the Hamburg Rules, which require that the carrier MUST issue to the shipper a bill of lading identifying the nature, quantity, quality and leading marks of the goods.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more recent}} historian, Sydney Maddocks, summarises the Guild's end [...] "The {{members of the}} Knighten Guild in 1115 granted their estate to the Priory and Convent of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, which grant King Henry I confirmed. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>possessions</b> <b>of</b> the Knighten Guild to Holy Trinity Priory {{immediately}} brought about trouble with Geoffrey de Mandeville, Constable of the Tower. Having taken a piece of ground in East Smithfield and made it into a vineyard, he and his successors held it by force. The situation of the vineyard cannot be identified, but it doubtless became attached to Tower Hill which it adjoined".|$|R
50|$|In 1458, after George {{had been}} elected as King <b>of</b> Bohemia, he <b>transferred</b> the Poděbrady <b>possessions</b> <b>of</b> Náchod and Hummel to his sons Boček and Victor, though he {{reserved}} the right to appoint the captains. A year later, the brothers confirmed Náchod's existing privileges and granted more. In 1465, King George <b>transferred</b> parts <b>of</b> the former <b>possessions</b> <b>of</b> the monastery at Opatovice nad Labem to common ownership of Boček and his brothers. However, when later in the same year, he <b>transferred</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> Münsterberg and Kladsko to the three brothers, Boček was not included.|$|R

50|$|However, most {{personal}} property items {{do not have}} a formal document of title. For such items, possession is the simplest indication of title, unless the circumstances give rise to suspicion about the possessor's ownership of the item. Proof of legal acquisition, such as a bill of sale or purchase receipt, is contributory. <b>Transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> to a good faith purchaser will normally convey title if no document is required.|$|E
50|$|The date of {{the closing}} is {{normally}} also the date when possession {{of the real estate}} is transferred from the seller(s) to the buyer(s). However, the real estate contract can specify a different date when possession changes hands. <b>Transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of a house, condominium, or building is usually accomplished by handing over the key(s) to it. The contract may have provisions in case the seller(s) hold over possession beyond the agreed date.|$|E
5000|$|Bring and take: Irish use {{of these}} words {{differs from that of}} British English because it follows the Irish grammar for beir and tóg. English usage is {{determined}} by direction; person determines Irish usage. So, in English, one takes [...] "from here to there", and brings it [...] "to here from there". In Irish, a person takes only when accepting a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of the object from someone elseand a person brings at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).|$|E

50|$|In 1387, Půta and Boček II of Poděbrady {{purchased}} the Lordship of Skuhrov nad Bělou and Rychmberk Castle {{in the foothills}} of the Orlické hory mountains from the brothers Jan and Jaroslav of České Meziříčí. In 1396, he <b>transferred</b> ownership <b>of</b> these <b>possessions</b> to his wife; this suggests that he was the sole owner at that time.|$|R

"A {{delivery}} order was not {{regarded as a}} document of title at common law {{with the result that}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the {{delivery order}} did not effect <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> constructive <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the goods. Attornment {{on the part of the}} bailee was required (i.e., an acknowledgement that the bailee held the goods on behalf of the transferee). The Uniform Documents of Title Act permits the use of negotiable delivery orders (if the order directs delivery to a named person or order). However, it is still necessary to single out delivery orders for special treatment. Until the delivery order is accepted by the bailee, there is no basi for imposing obligations on the bailee.

5000|$|In most ordinary, day-to-day {{commercial}} transactions, {{the conclusion}} of a contract of sale and the passing of ownership by delivery of the res occurs instantaneously. In some types of sale, however, there is a delay between the time of entry into the contract of sale and the time of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and ownership. The question that must be answered in these circumstances is this: Who gains the advantage of any benefits accruing to the res, and who bears the risk of damage occurring to it, during this window period? ...|$|E
50|$|A {{temporary}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> {{is called}} a bailment. Bailment is often regarded as the separation of ownership and possession. For example, the library continues to own the book while you possess it and will {{have the right to}} possess it again when your right comes to an end. A common transaction involving bailment is a conditional sale or hire-purchase, in which the seller lets the buyer have possession of the thing before it is paid for. The buyer pays the purchase price in installments and, when it is fully paid, ownership of the thing is transferred from seller to buyer.|$|E
50|$|For {{a pledge}} to come into {{existence}} as a real security right, {{it is essential that}} delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive, but the pledgee must retain possession of the pledged object. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> is intended to publicise the fact that a real security right, {{in the form of a}} pledge, has been established over the pledged object. The transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real security right by preventing the pledgor from alienating the pledged object or pledging it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted.|$|E
