5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> immediately {{killed a}} number of Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 27, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at {{the small town of}} Centralia and {{proceeded}} to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated into the lobby of the town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists, and hid their identities from <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass {{the women on}} the train, but <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E

5|$|In December 1863, Bramlette {{addressed}} the General Assembly, {{declaring that the}} state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army. January 4 of the following year, he proclaimed that rebel sympathizers would {{be held responsible for}} all guerrilla raids in the state, and specified stiff fines and imprisonment for anyone found to be aiding <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{army was}} tested in 1964 when the {{conflict}} with Ethiopia over the Somali-inhabited Ogaden erupted into warfare. On 16 June 1963, Somali guerrillas started an insurgency at Hodayo, in eastern Ethiopia, a watering place north of Werder, after Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie rejected their demand for self-government in the Ogaden. The Somali government initially refused to support the guerrilla forces, which eventually numbered about 3,000. However, in January 1964, after Ethiopia sent reinforcements to the Ogaden, Somali forces launched ground and air attacks across the border and started providing assistance to <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b> The Ethiopian Air Force responded with punitive strikes across its southwestern frontier against Feerfeer, northeast of Beledweyne and Galkayo. On 6 March 1964, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to a cease-fire. At {{the end of the}} month, the two sides signed an accord in Khartoum, Sudan, agreeing to withdraw their troops from the border, cease hostile propaganda, and start peace negotiations. Somalia also terminated its support of <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b>|$|E

5|$|Archie Clement led <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> after Anderson's death, but {{the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|From November 18 to December 8, four Bullet Club teams {{took part}} in the 2016 World Tag League; Guerrillas of Destiny and Page/Takahashi in block A and Fale/Bone Soldier and Owens/Omega in block B. Guerrillas of Destiny won their block with a record of six wins and one loss, {{advancing}} to the finals, while Page and Takahashi finished second with a record of four wins and three losses. In block B, Fale and Bone Soldier finished last by losing all seven of their matches, while Owens and Omega finished second to last with three wins and four losses. On December 10, Cody was revealed as the newest member of Bullet Club. Later that same day, <b>the</b> <b>Guerrillas</b> of Destiny were defeated in the finals of the 2016 World Tag League by Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma.

5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, the Filipino guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> could harass the Japanese Army and {{take control of the}} rural areas, jungles and mountains – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.|$|E

40|$|The Guerrilha do Araguaia had {{place in}} {{southern}} Pará {{and north of}} Goiás (nowadays, state of Tocantins), encompassing also areas of Maranhão, in the region known as 'Bico do Papagaio'. <b>The</b> <b>guerrilla</b> occurred between <b>the</b> middle 1960 s, when the first activists of Communist Party of Brazil (PC do B) arrived in the region, and 1974, when <b>the</b> last <b>guerrillas</b> were hunted and killed by militaries, trained to combat <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> and determined not to do prisoners. Executions, elimination of vestiges and torture are in the narratives collected, {{as well as in}} the existing literature on <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla.</b> <b>The</b> probable operações limpeza (operations to eliminate traces of evidence) were realized in many manners, to rely on the narratives collected by the team created by the Ministry of Defense to fulfill federal sentence produced in response to demand moved by the guerrillas' relatives. In addition to recovering <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla's</b> memory, from <b>the</b> narratives of who lived the experience, it is important to send light on what popularly is known as the 'second war'. In the region, the military governments set an intense system of repression and political control, and a model of occupation based on cattle ranching which destroyed the forests. So, when we tell on <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla,</b> we need also tell on the war that came afterwards...|$|R
5|$|Nigerian guerrillas {{arrive at}} a small village, grab a young boy named Yemi and try {{to force him to}} shoot an old man.

5|$|On August 25, 1863, General Ewing retaliated {{against the}} Confederate guerrillas by issuing General Order No. 11, an {{evacuation}} order that evicted almost 20,000 people from four Missouri counties and burned {{many of their}} homes. The order was intended to rob <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> of their support network in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill's leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County and left for Texas.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E

The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing {{had the effect of}} intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese had {{excellent}} {{coordination between}} light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics of quick airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force (Força Aérea Portuguesa or FAP) to surround and eliminate <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b> These bombardments {{were accompanied by}} the use of heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.|$|E

This fuelled French claims that <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> were periodically traveling between French territory and the adjoining sovereign Nguyễn territory to get supplies from provincial officials.|$|E

5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> generated little suspicion {{as they approached the}} town, even though it had received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E

To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E
