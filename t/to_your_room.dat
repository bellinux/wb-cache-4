60|$|Oakhurst (rising). You are not well, sir. Let me {{lead you}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I telephoned <b>to</b> <b>your</b> office, sent a groom <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> and <b>to</b> the club, {{and at last}} we {{had given}} you up," [...] Lord Arranmore remarked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wrote to}} you last Sunday {{to ask if}} {{anything}} was the matter with you, and as you didn't answer I went <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> on Wednesday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may all go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> and I {{will see}} about this later," [...] he said. [...] "Sobber, as you broke the dishes, {{you will have}} to pay for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{you dare}} {{to tell me}} this to my face!' roared old Hugh. 'Back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room,</b> girl! Back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> and stay there! Take off that finery. You go to no more dances. You shall stay in that room until I choose to let you out. No, not a word! I'll put you there if you don't go. In with you--ay, and take your {{knitting}} with you. Occupy yourself with that this evening instead of kicking your heels at The Springs!' ...|$|E
60|$|BRODIE. We shall see. Let me {{take you}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room.</b> Come. And, remember, it is for your brother's sake. It is to save me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not another word. Go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room.</b> And you, Ruddy and Ritter, {{report to}} me and to Captain Putnam at the private office at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{must be as}} Madame la Duchesse chooses,' {{said the}} Captain. 'She is under her charge, and must be sent to her {{as soon as this}} canaille is cleared off. <b>To</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms,</b> Madame!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't know as I am {{particularly}} anxious to, either," [...] Mr. Power pronounced. [...] "Are {{you going}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> here, Betty? If so, I'll come along. I guess Mr. Ware will excuse you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed, [...] "pay your bill {{and let us}} depart! I am in no humor for the caf√©s to-night. Let us go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> and sit quietly, or drive--whichever you choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|Manston {{instantly}} {{came back}} and spoke to Anne in an undertone. 'I should be glad if you could retire <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> for a short time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really can't say, Mr. Crocker; but as {{you have}} now {{expressed}} your wonder, perhaps you had better go back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> and do your work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> {{this instant}} {{and take it}} off!" [...] thundered the Doctor. [...] "I call it highly improper, and no {{daughter}} of mine shall wear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{drive you}} first <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms,</b> Monsieur Jesen," [...] he said. [...] "I take then {{the liberty of}} {{entering}} with you. The little conversation which we have begun is best concluded within the shelter of four walls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not yet,' {{said the}} goose. 'Take a good {{handful of the}} herb with you, and let us go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms.</b> We will collect all your money and clothes together, {{and then we will}} test the powers of the herb.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Colonel Ray," [...] I said, [...] "that {{you are not}} {{inclined}} to give me credit for very much common sense. Take those papers to Lord Chelsford. I will come round <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> as soon as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is it. I wouldn't trust {{an express}} company to deliver it. Suppose we go up <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> {{and see how}} the two look side by side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] Aynesworth answered. [...] "The letters marked private I {{have sent}} up <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room.</b> By the bye, there was {{something}} I wanted to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you will?... Say, {{you go down}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> now, {{and stay}} there till time for lunch. Study or read. Don't think another minute about this game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes. I {{came early}} {{in case you}} wanted <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> first. Do you know, I've been to the 'Milan' and chosen my table. There's a lovely band playing, and it's all quite a fairy tale, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't do {{anything}} of the sort," [...] Wilmore insisted. [...] "There's scarcely a soul in to-night, and the place is too humpy for a man who's been seeing spooks. Get back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> and change. I'll wait here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I answered, {{without giving}} him a clew to my suspicions; [...] "I will go with you <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> and see that you do the thing properly. I suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room,</b> Meriem," [...] he said; [...] "and Baynes, if {{you will}} step into my study, I'd {{like to have a}} word with you in a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, gentlemen," [...] he panted, [...] "I {{will come}} with you. <b>To</b> <b>your</b> <b>room,</b> Mr. Ward Mortimer, if you please! I feel that I owe you an explanation." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (calmly). Yes, ten years. We {{shall be}} glad to welcome our old friend back, Susan. I am going in <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> now to take the Latin class.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] Kendricks assured him. [...] "We {{are both}} being {{drawn into a}} queer little cycle of events, events which perhaps we may influence. When we get back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms,</b> I will tell you about it. Until then, not a word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Hunterleys," [...] he persisted, [...] "I beg {{of you to}} do as I ask. Let me {{take you}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms.</b> I will tell you all that has happened. Your husband {{will not be able}} to see you or speak with you." ...|$|R
60|$|BARBARA. Please, Mr. Anthony, Miss Foster said I was <b>to</b> show <b>your</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Mavering, I {{shall not}} let you stay with us another minute. You must go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> now and get ready. You {{ought to have a}} little rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] was {{the stern}} reply. [...] "Go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room,</b> girl, {{and take off}} that rig. There is {{to be no more}} play-acting in my house, {{remember}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray be silent, Elinor," [...] said Mr. Lind. [...] "This matter {{does not}} concern you. Marian: go <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>room</b> for the present. I shall {{speak to you}} afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now,' he added, 'you {{will let}} me come <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> this evening, for Mrs. Holmby is in such displeasure with me, that I shall get nothing but black looks. Besides, I {{want to see a}} little more of that nice girl, his sister.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{walking on}} the other side of the pavement,' said he, 'unless I'm much mistaken, is the young woman that used <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> be drawed. I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name, except paying tenants, o' course!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well done!' said Stalky at the door. 'So he didn't slay you. Stop laughing. He's {{talking to}} The Infant now about depositions. Look here, you're nearest his size. Cut up <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>rooms</b> and give Ipps your dinner things and a clean shirt for him.' ...|$|R
