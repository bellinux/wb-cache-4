5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula pusio grow on the ground, on well-rotted stumps, or among {{decaying}} tussock grass.

When Seltzer's wife died in 1965 he moved in with his daughter, Shirley Cooper, in Rocky River, Ohio. When Cooper and her husband moved to Spencer in Medina County in 1973, Seltzer moved with them. Seltzer died in his daughter's house on April 2, 1980 at the age of 82. Seltzer's living relatives {{at the time of his}} death included his daughter, two siblings, four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His son, Chester E.

5|$|Registered merchants {{were forced}} {{by law to}} wear white-colored clothes, an {{indication}} of their low status, and could be singled out for conscription into {{the armed forces and}} forced to resettle in lands to the deep south where malaria was known to be prevalent. In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> government officials.|$|E

5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{was thought}} to be saprotrophic, and has been {{described}} in this manner in both scholarly and popular discussions of the species. However, this classification was the result of its taxonomic history and comparisons with saprotrophic fungi that are not closely related. After its assignment to the Sclerodermatineae, a suborder whose members are ectomycorrhizal, its ecological role came into question. In 2007, Andrew Wilson and David Hibbett of Clark University and Eric Hobbie of the University of New Hampshire employed isotopic labeling, DNA sequencing, and morphological analysis to determine that this species is also ectomycorrhizal. Like all mycorrhizal fungi, C.cinnabarinum establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of trees, allowing the fungus to exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of the tree. This association is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. The only host trees identified for C.cinnabarinus are Quercus oaks, although related members of Calostoma have been observed <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> other trees in the Fagaceae family, such as beech.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with,</b> which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|Morris became {{increasingly}} {{fascinated with the}} idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life {{which appeared in the}} paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks. Burne-Jones shared this interest, but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. Tired of architecture, Morris abandoned his apprenticeship, with Rossetti persuading him to take up painting instead, which he chose to do in the Pre-Raphaelite style. Morris aided Rossetti and Burne-Jones in painting the Arthurian murals at Oxford Union, although his contributions were widely deemed inferior and unskilled compared to those of the others. At Rossetti's recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to the flat at Bloomsbury's No. 17 Red Lion Square by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a Medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.|$|E

5|$|Musidora {{is based}} on , a poem by the Scottish poet and playwright James Thomson (best known today {{as the author of}} Rule, Britannia!). Summer was {{initially}} published in 1727 and was republished in an altered form in 1730 along with Thomson's Winter (1726), Spring (1728) and Autumn (1730) as The Seasons. Although the individual poems attracted little interest on their release, The Seasons proved critically and commercially successful once completed, and Thomson began <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> important and influential London political and cultural figures. In June 1744 Thomson published a drastically revised version of The Seasons, which became extremely influential over the following century. Joseph Haydn wrote a major oratorio based on the poem, significant artists including Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner and Richard Westall painted scenes from it, and over 400 editions of The Seasons in a number of languages were published between 1744 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|Saori, nicknamed , is a {{girl who}} is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son. She takes an interest in encouraging Shuichi to cross-dress, even {{going so far as to}} buy Shuichi an expensive dress for Shuichi's birthday, which Shuichi later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.|$|E
5|$|Suillus salmonicolor {{occurs in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with various species of Pinus. This is a mutualistic relationship in which the subterranean fungal mycelia creates a protective sheath around the rootlets of the tree and a network of hyphae (the Hartig net) that penetrates between the tree's epidermal and cortical cells. This association helps the plant absorb water and mineral nutrients; in exchange, the fungus receives a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis. Two-, three-, and five-needled pines have all been recorded <b>to</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> S.salmonicolor. In North America, the fungus has been found growing with P.banksiana, P.palustris, P.resinosa, P.rigida, P.strobus and P.taeda. In Kamchatka (in the Russian Far East) {{it has been found}} in association with P.pumila, in the Philippines with P.kesiya, and in southern India with P.patula. The northern limit of its North American range is eastern Canada (Quebec), and the southern limit is Nuevo León and near Nabogame in Temósachi Municipality, Chihuahua, Mexico.|$|E
