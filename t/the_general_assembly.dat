5|$|There {{are several}} checks and {{balances}} built into the state constitution that limit the power of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Other clauses allow <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> to balance and limit {{the authority of the}} other branches of the government. Among these {{checks and balances}} is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E

5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert their own power during the American Civil War as <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} two decades, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> laid the {{foundation}} of the state. They created the framework for the state's public school system, began construction on the State Seminary and of roads {{in the southern part of}} the state. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> was faced with low tax revenues. In response to the problem, they created the Bank of Indiana and sold nine million acres (36,000km²) of public lands to finance their projects. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> relocated the capitol to Indianapolis in 1824, and in 1831 they authorized the construction of the first dedicated statehouse.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> delegates {{are elected}} from districts.

5|$|The {{authority}} and {{powers of the}} Indiana General Assembly are established in the state constitution. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> has sole legislative power within the state government.

Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each law passed by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> must be applied uniformly to the entire state; <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E

5|$|Though {{a strong}} {{governor}} with many successes, Clements {{was not able}} to enact his full legislative agenda.

He also failed in his attempts to establish statewide pension and civil service programs, and was unable to enact a merit system for state employees. Attempts to fund a veterans' bonus passed the two houses of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> in different forms and were unable to be reconciled.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> and between <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> In February 1797, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt {{in the minds of many}} legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state.

5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> for very specific purpose.

5|$|In 1895, Taylor {{was elected}} Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel {{proposed}} an election law {{that created a}} state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all election results. The board was to be appointed by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly,</b> {{and there were no}} requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor. The law passed <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly,</b> but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined that the bill was unconstitutional. The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Kentucky General Assembly {{enacted a}} law which created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed}} by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly,</b> who {{were responsible for}} choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties. The board was empowered to examine election returns and certify the results. The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> under Section 153 of the state constitution. The law was {{commonly referred to as}} the Goebel Election Law, a reference to its sponsor, President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate William Goebel. Because <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional.|$|E
