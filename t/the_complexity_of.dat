This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{syntactic}} <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> {{a regular}} language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup. <b>The</b> syntactic <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> a subclass of regular languages is <b>the</b> maximal syntactic <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> languages in that subclass, {{taken as a}} function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> these languages.

30|$|We {{have also}} {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed methods {{with those of}} M-CLMS when M= 2, 4, 8, and D-CLMS schemes in [49].

In these figures, {{it can be seen}} that <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes are advantageous comparing to the R-CMLF and D-CMLF schemes mainly due to the well known simplicity of LMS filters, and this advantage becomes larger with increasing number of combining filters (M). However, it can be also noted that <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> transfer and momentum terms are comparable to those of the core M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes, and therefore, the addition of transfer and momentum terms influences <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes more noticeably.|$|R
