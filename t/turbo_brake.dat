5000|$|Another use for {{the sliding}} vane type of {{turbocharger}} is as downstream engine exhaust brake (non-decompression-type), so that an extra exhaust throttle valve is not needed (<b>turbo</b> <b>brake).</b> Also, the mechanism can be deliberately modified to reduce the turbine efficiency in a predefined position. This mode can be selected to sustain a raised exhaust temperature to promote [...] "light-off" [...] and [...] "regeneration" [...] of a diesel particulate filter (this involves heating the carbon particles stuck in the filter until they oxidize away in a semi-self-sustaining reaction - rather like the self-cleaning process some ovens offer). Actuation of a VG turbocharger for EGR flow control or to implement braking or regeneration modes in general requires hydraulic or electric servo actuation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Porsche also {{introduced}} the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport, it was {{commonly known as}} the [...] "Turbo-look". It was a style that resembled the Porsche 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive [...] "tea tray” tail. It featured the stiffer turbo suspension and the superior <b>turbo</b> <b>braking</b> system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were particularly strong for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.|$|R
5000|$|Larger <b>brakes</b> (<b>turbo</b> only in US market, All {{cars for}} Japanese and European markets) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{big change}} for 1982 was the {{introduction}} of Saab's Automatic Performance Control (APC), a.k.a. boost controller. The APC employed a knock sensor, allowing the engine to use different grades of gasoline without engine damage. Another new feature that year was {{the introduction of}} central locking doors (on the GLE and <b>Turbo).</b> Asbestos-free <b>brakes</b> were introduced in 1983, an industry first. A new model also appeared that year in Sweden—the GLi, which used the fuel injected engine.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} included power steering, power front disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>Turbo</b> Hydra-matic transmission, full instrumentation and Pontiac's 301 cuin L V8 engine with {{two-barrel carburetor}} producing [...] Optional was a 4-bbl [...] version, along with numerous extra cost {{items such as}} snowflake wheels, whitewall or white-lettered tires, power windows and seats, tilt steering wheel, sunroof, and cruise control.|$|R
5000|$|The Veloster Turbo is a kammback {{turbocharged}} coupé. The model uses a 1.6L T-GDi Gamma {{engine that}} has different outputs {{depending on the}} market. In North America, the engine outputs [...] at 6,000 rpm, and [...] between 1,750-4,500 rpm. In other markets, such as Europe, it receives a lower-power engine outputting [...] at 5,500rpm with the same 265 Nm of torque, but altered to come earlier in the rev range at 1500 rpm. A possible reason for the European market receiving the lower-powered engine may be because the Kia Pro_Cee'd GT already makes use of the 150 kW engine. The car has three doors in North America and in Europe, making the Veloster <b>Turbo's</b> shooting <b>brake</b> body style both in North America and in Europe a relative novelty.|$|R
5000|$|A {{five-speed}} transmission, {{available in}} normally aspirated cars (type 016) starting in 1979 and standard on all turbos (type G31), was a dog-leg shift pattern Porsche unit, with first gear below reverse {{on the left}} side. This was robust, but expensive due to some 915 internal parts, and was replaced for 1980 with a normal H-pattern Audi five-speed on all non-turbo cars. This lighter duty design was originally not used on the more powerful 924 <b>Turbo.</b> The <b>brakes</b> were solid discs at the front and drums at the rear. The car was criticized in Car and Driver magazine for this braking arrangement, which {{was viewed as a}} step backward from the 914's standard four-wheel disc brakes. However, four-wheel disc brakes, five stud hubs and alloys from the 924 Turbo were available on the base 924 as an [...] "S" [...] package starting with the 1980 model year. Also, standard brakes could be optioned on the turbo as a cost-saving measure.|$|R
2500|$|Not much {{changed for}} the 1988 year, with the {{exception}} of the dropping of two-toned brown exterior paint. The <b>turbo</b> spoiler <b>brake</b> light changed from a square, to a trapezoid shape. Seat pattern was changed from squares to lines, and [...] "foil" [...] on climate control and switch gear changed from light to dark gray. Japanese buyers could select from six different trim packages starting with the top level 3.0 GT Turbo Limited with the 7M-GTEU, followed by 3.0 GT Turbo, GT Twin Turbo with the 1G-GTEU DOHC 2.0 L engine, the GT with the 1G-GEU 2.0 L DOHC, the G with the 1G-EU and the S with the 1G-EU engine as the base model. All Japanese Supras came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission with ECT-s except the G and the S where ECT-S wasn't available. In Japan the 3.0 GT Turbo Limited, the 3.0 GT Turbo and the GT Twin Turbo were installed standard with a digital instrument panel, the 3.0 L installed versions came with an AM/FM Cassette stereo with an integrated CD player and cruise control. Climate control was also standard on all turbo equipped vehicles, and leather interior was only available on the GT Turbo Limited.|$|R
50|$|On January 20, 1999, Handley {{once again}} {{got into the}} record books by flying the <b>Turbo</b> Raven from <b>brake</b> release to 3,000 meters in one minute and nine seconds. In July 1999 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, the Turbo Raven took three minutes, six seconds to get to 6,000 meters, and {{established}} the Turbo Raven as the fastest-climbing propeller-driven aircraft in the world. This aircraft was also able to reverse the pitch of its propeller blades in flight, and could actually slow down while diving towards the ground; Handley used this ability to make very steep approaches to land, {{as well as for}} unique maneuvers where he could slow below stall speed while diving. On October 3, 1999, exactly one year to the day after its debut, the Turbo Raven was destroyed after the engine failed to deliver power during one such approach at the California International Airshow at Salinas Municipal Airport, and Handley was unable to accelerate above stall speed with the propeller in reverse pitch. He was seriously injured, but made a full recovery, and was flying within a month after the accident. The NTSB official accident investigation found no indications of problems with power plant and the propeller, and attributed the crash to pilot error.|$|R
5000|$|The 944 Turbo S's {{suspension}} had the [...] "M030" [...] option {{consisting of}} Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height adjusting threaded collars {{on the front}} struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8 mm hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 in in the front, and 9 in in the rear with 52 mm offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 {{in the front and}} 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction clutch disc setup, an external cooler, and a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The <b>Turbo</b> S front <b>brakes</b> were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.|$|R
