5|$|In {{addition}} to causing {{about two-thirds of}} its members to quit between 1906 and 1910, the radicalization of the FVdG also correlates to a slight change in the milieu, industries, and regions from which the organization drew its members. Many metal and construction workers, who had a localist tradition, left {{as a result of}} the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG. Miners, who worked mostly in the Ruhr area, did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I, a sign of what was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> the war.|$|E
5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

However, Robson managed to persuade him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> a lengthy discussion. Bellamy praised Robson's man management ability for his handling of the incident.|$|E
25|$|According to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev {{would go}} on to say that this {{incident}} was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home. The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>After</b> this debacle the arms race accelerated and any considerations for negotiations were dashed for the immediate future.|$|E
25|$|Baudelaire's {{influence}} on the direction of modern French (and English) language literature was considerable. The most significant French writers <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, Arthur Rimbaud praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true God'. In 1895, Stéphane Mallarmé published a sonnet in Baudelaire's memory, 'Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire'. Marcel Proust, in an essay published in 1922, stated that along with Alfred de Vigny, Baudelaire was 'the greatest poet of the nineteenth century'.|$|E

25|$|For {{many decades}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> independence, {{the economies of}} the three former Portuguese African territories {{involved}} in the war continued to remain problematic due to continuing internecine political conflicts and power struggles as well as inadequate agricultural production caused by disruptive government policies resulting in high birth mortality rates, widespread malnutrition, and disease. By the 21st century, the Human Development Index of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, were among {{the lowest in the}} World, while corruption and social inequality soared.|$|E
25|$|In Latter-day Saint theology, the name-title Elias is {{not always}} synonymous with Elijah and is often used for people other than the biblical prophet. According to Joseph Smith, The spirit of Elias is first, Elijah second, and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the spirit and power of Elijah is <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after,</b> holding the keys of power, {{building}} the Temple to the capstone, placing the seals of the Melchizedek Priesthood upon the house of Israel, and making all things ready; then Messiah comes to His Temple, which is last of all.|$|E
25|$|By 1910, an {{improved}} braking schedule had been introduced, known as AMRE. This setup, and all others <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after,</b> permitted graduated {{release of the}} brakes for finer control of brake applications. Additionally, AMRE allowed for the electric synchronization of braking throughout an entire train, causing all brakes on all cars of the train to apply uniformly and simultaneously. This created a smoother braking effort throughout the train. In order for the electric synchronization to work, {{it was necessary to}} insert an electric brake key to activate the feature. All of the older IRT cars, including the Composites, were refitted with the new AMRE system circa 1910.|$|E

25|$|The {{countryside}} is beautiful, but {{the weather}} is cold and often inclement, the cottage is without running water or light, they have no food and the locals are unwelcoming – in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends. They see Jake prowling around their cottage. Marwood suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed {{in the interest of}} safety, but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail becomes paranoid that the poacher is going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has been stranded with a punctured tyre.|$|E
25|$|The Parliamentarians {{put up a}} {{surprisingly}} stout resistance, {{and according to the}} Royalists shot at them from houses as they drove the small Parliamentary force from the town and back towards Lichfield from whence they came. To suppress the musket fire, the Royalists torched the houses from which the shooting was thought <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>After</b> the battle the Royalists {{spent the rest of the}} day in the town during which time they pillaged it. The next morning after the main body of the Royalist force had left town, many more houses were put to the torch. While pillaging and firing an unfortified town in retaliation for resistance was common at that time on Continental Europe it was not usual in England and this handed the Parliamentary side a propaganda weapon which they used to disparage the Royalists.|$|E

Cogsworth informs him she refuses <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>after</b> a shouting match between Belle and the Beast (which ends in a victory for Belle) he tells her if she cannot eat with him then she will not eat at all. In his quarters, he sulks and notes his fate should the spell not break ("How Long Must This Go On?"). Eventually, Belle does become hungry and ventures into the kitchen where the servants offer her dinner despite their master's orders. They treat her to an amazing cabaret show ("Be Our Guest").|$|E

25|$|Later it was {{discussed}} that a separate branch should {{be created in}} order to handle everything pertaining to the anti-Castro movement. The White House division organized Branch 4 (WH/4)as the new task force to run Cuban Operations. The task force included 40 personnel, with 18 at headquarters, 20 at the Havana station, and 2 at Santiago base. The state department was concerned that if Castro was overthrown then the people <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> him would be worse than him. These people were Che Guevara and Raul Castro. So they proposed {{a way of getting}} a better leader that they approved of in his place. The CIA began to worry that their involvement with the anti-Castro movement would lead to an anti-US movement. On March 14 of 1960, Dulles presented a “General Covert Action Plan for Cuba” that would focus only on the Cuban problems. Guerrilla capacity in the anti-Castro groups {{both in and out of}} Cuba {{was discussed}}.|$|E
25|$|The Mayflower {{departed}} Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot {{ship had}} 102 passengers and {{a crew of}} about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined {{with a lack of}} proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>After</b> arriving at their destination, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter. During the voyage there was a turbulent storm during which John Howland fell overboard. He managed to grab a topsail halyard that was trailing in the water and was hauled back aboard safely.|$|E
25|$|While {{traversing}} Wildermore {{in search}} of ways to oppose Nurzum, the player and his companions unexpectedly come across Nona. Since her departure in Eaworth, {{she made her way}} to the city of Byre Tor, which has been razed by Nurzum, and cared for the survivors, her hatred for Men of Rohan lessened by the kind actions. Her reunion with Horn is brief and cold, and not having yet resolved her feelings for him, she chooses to leave again. The others follow her to a cave where she hides survivors from the snow, among them Harding's son Leodwig, injured but alive. Seeing wrath of Nurzum firsthand, Corudan the Elf decides to search for aid among the Ents of the nearby Fangorn Forest. He and the player manage to find and wake the Ent Leaflock (Finglas) and relay him Nuzum's story. The Ent cares little for troubles of Men, but defiling of Huorn's remains rouses him to anger and he commands Huorns of the forest <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> the giant. Nurzum fights off the attack, but is weakened and later defeated by the player and Heroes of Wildermore. Meanwhile, Nona and Horn resolve their feelings and finally commit to each other.|$|E
