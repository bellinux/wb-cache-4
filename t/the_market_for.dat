5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.

40|$|To {{understand}} the crude oil price determination process {{it is necessary}} to extend the analysis beyond <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> petroleum. Crude oil prices are determined in two closely related markets: <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> crude oil and <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> refined products. Crude oil is a raw material used in the refinery in a joint products process. For a given level of crude oil supply, the value of petroleum lies in the value of refined products produced from it. ^ An econometric-linear programming model was developed to capture the linkages between <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> crude oil and refined products. In the LP refiners maximize profits given crude oil supplies, refining capacities, and prices of refined products. The objective function is profit maximization net of crude oil prices. The shadow price on crude oil gives the netback price. Refined product prices are obtained from the econometric models. ^ The model covers the free world divided in five regions. The model is used to analyze the impacts on <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> of policies that affect crude oil supplies, the demands for refined products, and the refining industry. For each scenario analyzed the demand for crude oil is derived from the equilibrium conditions in <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> products. <b>The</b> demand curve is confronted with a supply curve which maximizes revenues providing an equilibrium solution for both crude oil and product <b>markets.</b> <b>The</b> model also captures crude oil price differentials by quality. ^ The results show that the demands for crude oil are different across regions due to the structure of the refining industries and the characteristics of the demands for refined products. Changes in the demands for products have a larger impact on <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> than changes in the refining industry. Since <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> refined products and crude oil are interrelated they can 2 ̆ 7 t be analyzed individually if an accurate and complete assessment of a policy is to be made. Changes in only one product market in one region affect <b>the</b> other product <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> prices of crude oil. ...|$|R

When <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> manufactured goods are less competitive than <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> primary commodities, <b>the</b> volatility of relative commodity prices rises when exchange rate uncertainty increases. If demand for manufactured goods is intertemporally dependent, even a small increase in exchange rate uncertainty can result in potentially large costs in terms of increased relative commodity price instability. ...|$|R
