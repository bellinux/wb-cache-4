2500|$|Soon after {{qualifying}} as a doctor, Barnard performed {{experiments on}} dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps {{to develop in}} the intestines.

[...] He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. [...] The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. [...] To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches).

Many other cases could be given, as of a whole family who became insane at the age of forty. (14/41. Piorry page 109; Prosper Lucas tome 2 page 759.) Other cerebral affections sometimes follow the same rule,--for instance, epilepsy and apoplexy.

40|$|<b>Tubercular</b> <b>meningitis</b> is {{a severe}} form of {{central nervous system}} {{tuberculosis}} with high morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Background: Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{involvement}} in tuberculosis is around 5 – 10 %. Of the various manifestations of CNS tuberculosis, meningitis {{is the most}} common (70 – 80 %). Delay in diagnosis and treatment results in significant morbidity and mortality. Objective: To study the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cortisol levels in <b>tubercular</b> <b>meningitis</b> and compare the levels with controls. Methods: Cross-sectional, prospective, observational, hospital-based study done in 20 patients of <b>tubercular</b> <b>meningitis,</b> 20 patients of aseptic meningitis (AM) and 25 control subjects without any preexisting neurological disorders who have undergone lumbar puncture for spinal anesthesia. Results: Cortisol was detected in all 40 CSF samples of patients (100 %). Mean CSF cortisol level was 8. 82, 3. 47 and 1. 05 in <b>tubercular</b> <b>meningitis,</b> AM and controls, respectively. Mean CSF cortisol level in <b>tubercular</b> <b>meningitis</b> was significantly higher as compared to AM and controls (P < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Cortisol level estimation in CSF is one of the rapid, relatively inexpensive diagnostic markers in early identification of <b>tubercular</b> <b>meningitis</b> along with CSF findings of elevated proteins, hypoglycorrhachia and lymphocytic pleocytosis. This aids in earlier institution of appropriate treatment and thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality.

Study revealed that majority of the study subjects were below 39 years (76 %) of age and most of them were male (80 %). Predominant cases were found to be pyogenic meningitis (44 %), followed by encephalitis (32 %), cerebral malaria (20 %) and <b>tubercular</b> <b>meningitis</b> (4 %).

Mate-rial and Methods: Four hundred and nine patients having communicating hydrocephalus were selected for the proce-dure during a 10 -year period from March 1992 to February 2002. The average follow-up was 45. 34 months. Results: <b>Tubercular</b> <b>meningitis</b> (TBM) -related hydrocephalus was de-tected in 285 patients.

At the time of discharge 56. 7 % patients improved in their GCS to 13 - 15 and 14. 9 % were in GCS 8 or less. The overall mortality was 5. 13 % and shunt-related mortality was seen in 2 % patients.
