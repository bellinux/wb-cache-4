5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> {{of applications}} of archaean enzymes, {{the use of}} the organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E
50|$|The first European person <b>to</b> visit <b>the</b> {{area was}} William Gosse in 1873. With {{the help of}} local Aboriginal people, Gosse and his team {{explored}} <b>the</b> Mann <b>Ranges</b> after seeing <b>the</b> <b>range</b> from <b>the</b> top of Uluṟu. From <b>the</b> Mann <b>Ranges,</b> he went west <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tomkinson <b>Ranges,</b> but turned back rather than trying <b>to</b> cross <b>the</b> Great Victoria Desert.

5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E
5|$|The BLM {{management}} of the herd has included improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> to give the horses additional access to water, and numerous roundups that {{have resulted in the}} removal and adoption of hundreds of horses to private individuals, including over 50 horses in 2009, and another 44 in 2012. In 2015, a plan was approved to gather 6-12 one and two year old horses annually until the contraceptive vaccine the mares are given can lower birth rates more. This resulted in the most recent gather and removal of 17 horses and 1 foal. Once again, every horse captured was adopted. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range {{is one of the most}} accessible areas to view feral horse herds in the United States and tourism to the area has increased in recent years.|$|E

5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>range.</b> In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E
