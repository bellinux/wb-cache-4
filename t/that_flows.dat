5|$|There are {{traffic lights}} on the short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock, which are used to {{indicate}} {{the state of the}} river in times of flood. Green indicates <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> are low or normal, and boats can proceed along this stretch. Red indicates <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> are high and that great care is required. Flashing red indicates <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> are very high and boats must not use the section.|$|E

50|$|Ben Lomond's geology is {{dominated}} by granite, mica schist, diorite, porphyry and quartzite. Ben Lomond lies on the Scottish watershed, the drainage divide which separates river systems <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> to the east from those <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> to the west.|$|R
5|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> {{at the river}} mouth by 1995 had declined to only 27% of natural outflows. The probability of the bottom end of the Murray experiencing drought-like flows had increased from 5% under natural conditions to 60% by 1995.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|In Allegan County, I-196/US31 {{passes a}} pair of golf courses and {{continues}} northward through farm fields. Near the community of Glenn, A-2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east. The two roads trade places again when I-196/US31 turns northeasterly {{on the south side}} of the twin cities of Saugatuck and Douglas. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo River <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.|$|E
50|$|At {{one time}} the winged mapleleaf {{could be found in}} {{thirteen}} states. It lived in nearly all the rivers and streams <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> into the Mississippi River. It was once also found in some rivers and streams <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> into the Missouri River.|$|R
50|$|In North America, another, mainly non-mountainous divide, the Laurentian Divide (or Northern Divide), further {{separates}} the Hudson Bay-Arctic Ocean drainage region from the Atlantic watershed region. Secondary divides separate the watersheds <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> into the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River (ultimately into the Atlantic) from watersheds <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> to the Atlantic via the Missouri-Mississippi complex. Another secondary divide follows the Appalachian chain, which separates those {{streams and rivers}} <b>that</b> <b>flow</b> directly into the Atlantic Ocean from those that exit via the Mississippi River.|$|R

5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|E
5|$|Solar power towers use {{thousands}} of individual sun-tracking mirrors (called heliostats) to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located {{on top of}} a tall tower. The receiver collects the sun's heat in a heat-transfer fluid <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> through the receiver. The U.S. Department of Energy, with a consortium of utilities and industry, built the first two large-scale, demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow, California.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{begins on}} the Pocono Plateau. It is a {{mountain}} stream <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> the Moosic Mountains in Simersons Gap. At points, it also flows through a gorge or through dense brush. Mountains in the watershed include Coon Hill and Scrub Oak Mountain. The topography of the watershed is mountainous, with high steep hills {{that have been}} rounded by glaciation. The stream's valley is narrow. It {{is one of the}} larger tributaries of the Lackawanna River. It is a second-order stream.|$|E

5|$|The waterfalls are on {{the section}} of Kitchen Creek <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> down the Allegheny Front, a steep {{escarpment}} between the Allegheny Plateau {{to the north and}} the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The glens are made of sedimentary rocks from the Huntley Mountain and Catskill Formations that formed up to 370million years ago in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The waterfalls are the result of increased flow in Kitchen Creek from glaciers enlarging its drainage basin during the last Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|Cotters Pond {{is a small}} {{landmark}} located {{beyond a}} few mountains and hills on the southern side of NY74 {{near the end of}} Paradox Lake. Cotters Pond, by state law, is a water body that cannot be used for baitfishing. This was designated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Shortly afterward, NY74 passes Bumbo Pond and enters the hamlet of Paradox. After leaving Paradox, NY74 turns to the southeast along the base of Skiff Mountain. The highway then approaches a creek <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> into Eagle Lake. NY74 crosses over Eagle Lake and runs along the base of Eagle Cliff and the shores of the lake. After leaving Eagle Lake, the highway intersects with County Route2 (CR2), the first numbered highway that NY74 encounters after US9.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood <b>that</b> <b>flows.</b> The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E

5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E
5|$|The city's Mohawk name, Unundadages ("around the hill") {{refers to}} {{a bend in the}} Mohawk River <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> around the city's {{elevated}} position as seen from the Deerfield Hills in the north. The Erie Canal and Mohawk River pass through northern Utica; northwest of downtown is the Utica Marsh, a group of cattail wetlands between the Erie Canal and Mohawk River (partially in the town of Marcy) with a variety of animals, plants and birds. During the 1850s, plank roads were built through the marshland surrounding the city. Utica's suburbs have more hills and cliffs than the city. Located where the Mohawk Valley forms a wide floodplain, the city has a generally sloping, flat topography.|$|E
5|$|The water <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> {{through the}} Roman Baths is {{considered}} unsafe for bathing, {{partly due to}} its having passed through the still-functioning original lead pipes, and up until World War II, it was advertised {{on the basis of}} the radioactivity it contained. However, the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases. In October 1978, a young girl swimming with the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed that Naegleria fowleri, an extremely dangerous disease-causing amoeba, was in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes.|$|E

5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream <b>that</b> <b>flows</b> into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
