30|$|However, the {{catalytic}} {{effects of}} rGO {{can be enhanced}} with doping; one such approach is to insert cations or anions, {{but we need to}} be mindful of the costs of the fabricated catalyst as well as its efficiency [21 – 24]. Hence, we have been pursuing a strategy of doping rGO with <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> (<b>TM)</b> to enhance its catalytic activity. For this purpose, in this study, we insert various <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions (TM+) into rGO, and then systematically compare the catalytic activities of these rGO samples doped with <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> (TM-rGO).|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanism}} of half-metallicity (HM) formation in <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> doped (<b>TM)</b> conjugated carbon based structures by first-principles electronic structure simulations. It is found that the HM is a rather complex phenomenon, determined by the ligand field splitting of d-orbitals of the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> (<b>TM)</b> atoms, the exchange splitting {{and the number of}} valence electrons. Since most of the conjugated carbon based structures possess ligands with intermediate strength, the ordering of the d-orbital splitting is similar in all structures, and the HM properties evolve according to the number of valence electrons. Based on this insight we predict that Cr-, Fe-, Co-doped graphyne will show HM, while Mn- and Ni-doped graphyne will not. By tuning the number of valence electron, we are thus able to control the emergence of HM and control the energy gaps evolving in majority or minority spin channels...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} and dissociation of dinitrogen on <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> (Ta, W and Re) doped MgO(100) surface {{has been}} studied employing density functional theory.
