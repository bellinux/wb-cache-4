5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{were the first to}} prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman {{were granted}} a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> lamp that lasted longer and gave {{brighter}} light than the carbon filament. <b>Tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type {{is often called}} Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.|$|E
50|$|The typical valve {{using this}} {{topology}} in (rare) current commercial production is the 300B, which yields about 5 watts in SE mode. Rare amplifiers {{of this type}} use valves such as the 211 or 845, capable of about 18 watts. These valves are bright emitter transmitting valves, and have thoriated <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments</b> which glow like light bulbs when powered.|$|R

25|$|For example, a {{tungsten}} {{light bulb}} filament generates heat, {{so it would}} have a positive nonzero value for q when turned on. While the light is turned off, the value of q for the <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> would be zero.|$|E
25|$|If a {{light bulb}} {{envelope}} leaks, the hot <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> reacts with air, yielding an aerosol of brown tungsten nitride, brown tungsten dioxide, violet-blue tungsten pentoxide, and yellow tungsten trioxide that then deposits on the nearby surfaces or the bulb interior.|$|E
25|$|Consumption of {{incandescent}} light bulbs grew {{rapidly in the}} US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with carbon <b>filaments.</b> When <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments</b> were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).|$|R

When an electrical current is run across the wires, no voltage can be measured as long as they remain perfectly aligned. But if some force disturbs the symmetry, and thus the resistance in the wires, the gauge puts out a voltage proportional to the force.|$|R
25|$|In 1917, Burnie Lee Benbow {{was granted}} a patent for inventing the coiled coil filament. In 1921, Junichi Miura created the first double-coil bulb using a coiled coil <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> while working for Hakunetsusha (a {{predecessor}} of Toshiba). At the time, machinery to mass-produce coiled coil filaments did not exist. Hakunetsusha developed a method to mass-produce coiled coil filaments by 1936.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps convert more of {{the input}} power to visible light than {{incandescent}} lamps, though as of 2013 LEDs are sometimes even more efficient and are more rapidly increasing in efficiency. A typical 100 watt <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> incandescent lamp may convert only 5% of its power input to visible white light (400–700nm wavelength), whereas typical fluorescent lamps convert about 22% of the power input to visible white light.|$|E
25|$|Lamp power also {{influences}} colour in tungsten lamps. As {{the lamp}} power is decreased, the <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> in a bulb {{will tend to}} produce increasing percentages of orange light, {{as compared to the}} nearly white light emitted at full power. This is known as amber drift or amber shift. Thus a 1000-watt instrument at 50 percent power will emit a higher percentage of orange light than a 500-watt instrument operating at full power.|$|E
50|$|LED {{flashlights}} may consume 1 watt or {{much more}} from the battery, producing heat as well as light. In contrast to <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments,</b> which must be hot to produce light, both the light output {{and the life of}} an LED decrease with temperature. Heat dissipation for the LED often dictates that small high-power LED flashlights have aluminium or other high heat conductivity bodies, reflectors and other parts, to dissipate heat; they can become warm during use.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments</b> operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments</b> remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|R
50|$|Halogen heaters {{comprise}} <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments</b> in sealed quartz envelopes, {{mounted in}} front of a metal reflector in a plastic case. They operate at a higher temperature than Nichrome wire heaters but not as high as incandescent light bulbs, radiating primarily in the infrared spectrum. They convert up to 86% of their input power to radiant energy, losing the remainder to conductive and convective heat. The halogen cycle reduces the darkening of the quartz envelope and lengthens the life of the filament.|$|R
25|$|Electron-beam {{physical}} vapor deposition, or EBPVD, {{is a form}} {{of physical}} vapor deposition in which a target anode is bombarded with an electron beam given off by a charged <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> under high vacuum. The electron beam causes atoms from the target to transform into the gaseous phase. These atoms then precipitate into solid form, coating everything in the vacuum chamber (within line of sight) with a thin layer of the anode material.|$|E
25|$|From the top down, the TEM {{consists}} of an emission source, which may be a <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> or needle, or a lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) single crystal source. The gun is connected to a high voltage source (typically ~100–300 kV) and, given sufficient current, the gun will begin to emit electrons either by thermionic or field electron emission into the vacuum. The electron source is typically mounted in a Wehnelt cylinder to provide preliminary focus of the emitted electrons into a beam. The upper lenses of the TEM then further focus the electron beam to the desired size and location.|$|E
25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|E

25|$|Earlier, {{household}} {{clothes dryers}} sometimes incorporated a germicidal lamp {{in series with}} an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220–240V countries was a circleline tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted mercury-vapor lamps incorporate ordinary <b>tungsten</b> <b>filaments</b> within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.|$|R

25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament,</b> {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the headlamp bulb or sealed beam. Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in sealed beam units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|E
25|$|His initial {{contributions}} to science {{came from his}} study of light bulbs (a continuation of his Ph.D. work). His first major development was {{the improvement of the}} diffusion pump, which ultimately led to the invention of the high-vacuum rectifier and amplifier tubes. A year later, he and colleague Lewi Tonks discovered that the lifetime of a <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an inert gas, such as argon, the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process. He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency. These were important developments {{in the history of the}} incandescent light bulb. His work in surface chemistry began at this point, when he discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb.|$|E
25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and nasopharynx. The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an endoscope (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (a diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin urologist Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the <b>tungsten</b> <b>filament</b> incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E
