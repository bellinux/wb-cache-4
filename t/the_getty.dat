5|$|In 2005, after {{a series}} of {{articles}} in the Los Angeles Times about the spending practices of <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Trust and its then-president Dr. Barry Munitz, the California Attorney General conducted an investigation of <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Trust and found that no laws had been broken. The trust agreed to appoint an outside monitor to review future expenditures. <b>The</b> <b>Getty</b> Trust experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1,487 budgeted staff positions to reduce expenses. Although <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Trust endowment reached $6.4 billion in 2007, it dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. The endowment rebounded to $6.2 billion by 2013.|$|E

40|$|Our {{contention}} {{is that to}} solve <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem, a notion of infallible knowledge involving the substantial truth theory is necessary. We assume that acts of sense experience have propositional content, and that atomic empirical propositions need the existence of non-mental objects to be true. This approach allows for making the distinction between epistemically good justifiers and ontologically good justifiers, and leads to a definition of propositional empirical knowledge free of <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem. Our explication of <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem rejects Hetherington’s (2012) view that <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem rests on jointly unsatisfiable constraints, sheds a new light on Floridi’s (2004) result, avoids the Pyrrhonian skepticism, {{as well as the}} skepticism defended by Kirkham (1984), and vindicates the substantial notion of truth...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem is <b>the</b> {{problem of}} {{revising}} {{the view that}} knowledge is justified true belief {{in a way that}} is immune to <b>Gettier</b> counter-examples. <b>The</b> “Gettier Problem problem”, according to Lycan, is the problem of saying what is misguided about trying to solve <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem. In this paper I take up <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem problem. I distinguish giving conditions that are necessary and sufficient for knowledge from giving conditions that explain why one knows when one does know. I argue that the problem with <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> Problem is that it requires us to articulate conditions that suffice for knowledge even if those conditions are non-explanatory. After defending this view, I take up two related methodological issues, one about the evidence that can be given in favor of an account of knowledge, and one about the role that investigating justification might play in investigating knowledg...|$|R

5|$|From 1983 to June 1999, the Trust ran <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Information Institute (GII) {{which sought}} to collect {{electronic}} information to serve cultural heritage institution and researchers. Together with the American Council of Learned Societies GII sought to build a broad coalition of non-profits to establish a National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to suggest a new {{interpretation}} to <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> problem by showing that the standard JTB definition of knowledge is not epistemologically incomplete, being at the same time formally incomplete. <b>The</b> <b>Gettier</b> problem is shown to emerge through the implicit self application of the JTB definition of knowledge to prove its own incompleteness. A conclusion is drawn, which runs counter to the traditional view that the problem necessarily requires a conceptual amendment of the standard definition, in spite of the formal incompleteness of <b>the</b> latter. <b>The</b> <b>Gettier</b> problem is construed to be related to the ancient Meno problem within a contemporary justificational discourse...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a principled and elegant solution to <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> problem. <b>The</b> key move is {{to draw a}} general metaphysical distinction and conscript it for epistemological purposes. Section 1 introduces <b>the</b> <b>Gettier</b> problem. Sections 2 – 5 discuss instructively wrong or incomplete previous proposals. Section 6 presents my solution and explains its virtues. Section 7 answers the most common objection...|$|R

5|$|The center {{ultimately}} {{opened to}} the public on December 16, 1997. Although the total project cost was estimated to be $350 million as of 1990, it was later estimated to be $1.3 billion. After the center opened, the villa closed for extensive renovations and reopened on January 28, 2006, to focus on the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. Currently, the museum displays collections at both <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Center and <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Villa in Pacific Palisades.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} surrounding the Greek and Italian governments' claim that {{objects in the}} collection were looted and should be repatriated. In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> returned or promised to return four looted objects to Greece: a stele (grave marker), a marble relief, a gold funerary wreath, and a marble statue. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> signed an agreement to return 40 looted items to Italy.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, <b>The</b> <b>Getty’s</b> {{released}} Hymns for the Christian Life, {{a collection}} of music that most strongly represented <b>the</b> <b>Getty's</b> move to Nashville, Tennessee.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Getty</b> Villa {{is one of}} two {{locations}} of the J. Paul Getty Museum. Located at the easterly end of the Malibu coast in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, USA, <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Villa is an educational center and museum dedicated {{to the study of the}} arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500BC to 400AD, including the Lansdowne Heracles and the Victorious Youth. The UCLA/Getty Master’s Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation is housed on this campus. The collection is documented and presented through the online GettyGuide as well as through audio tours.|$|E

5|$|Meier also {{designed}} three other buildings located {{next to the}} north promontory and offset at a 22.5 degree angle from the main axis of the Museum pavilions. The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and the rotunda. The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators. A bridge over a sunken courtyard links the main entrance of the East Building to the main walkway that connects the auditorium and North Buildings to the rotunda. These buildings house <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Conservation Institute (GCI), the J. Paul Getty Trust and <b>the</b> <b>Getty</b> Foundation.
