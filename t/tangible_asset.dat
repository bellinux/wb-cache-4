With these sukuk, the borrower's <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> is `sold` to the financier {{and then}} `leased` {{back to the}} borrowers. The borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset. [...] They {{are the most common}} type of sukuk (as of 2015), [...] and have been described (by Faleel Jamaldeen) as well-known because of there simplicity, tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income.|$|E
2500|$|Sukuk were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many Muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in non-Sharia-compliant activities (gambling, alcohol, pork, etc.). [...] Sukuk securities are structured to comply with Sharia by paying profit, not interest—generally by involving a <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> in the investment. For example, Sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company (and held in a Special Purpose Vehicle), so that sukuk holders can collect the property's profit as rent, (which is allowed under Islamic law). Because they represent ownership of real assets and (at least in theory) do not guarantee repayment of initial investment, sukuk resemble equity instruments, but like a bond (and unlike equity) regular payments cease upon their expiration. However, most sukuk are [...] "asset-based" [...] rather than [...] "asset-backed"—their assets are not truly owned by their Special Purpose Vehicle, and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments.|$|E

40|$|The asset {{structure}} of companies should matter for financing decisions. Small and medium-sized companies in Croatia may use <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> as collateral, either providing more access to creditors or as a guarantee in case of bankruptcy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and the capital {{structure of}} Croatian small and medium-sized enterprises. Most previous studies have shown various relationships between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and leverage. This study has been conducted on a sample of 500 Croatian SMEs for the period between 2005 and 2010. The data used for the empirical analysis were taken from companies’ annual reports. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied in order to examine the relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and leverage measures. The results of this research indicate that <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> are differently correlated with short-term and long-term leverage. The relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and short-term leverage is negative and statistically significant in all observed years. The relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and long-term leverage is positive in all observed years and statistically significant. The results show that small and medium-sized companies use their collateral to attract long-term debt, which means that small and medium-sized companies use lower costs and the interest rate of long-term debt in relation to short-term debt. These findings correspond with the maturity matching principle, according to which long-term assets are financed with long-term financing and short-term assets are financed with short-term funds. These results suggest that <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> have a positive impact on the long-term debt of Croatian SMEs because <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> constitute a positive signal to the financial institutions, which can request the selling of these assets in case of bankruptcy. These findings are consistent with the trade-off theory which predicts a positive relation between leverage and tangibility, but also with the pecking order theory, which is generally interpreted as predicting a negative relation between leverage and tangibility.

30|$|There is also {{an intense}} debate {{on the role of}} credit {{multiplier}} in establishing the external financing – cash flows relationship. The credit multiplier is considered as an additional instrument, which makes the relationship between cash flows and external funds less negative. Financially constrained firms suffer more from adverse selection costs than the financially unconstrained firms do. Therefore, creditors require more loan guarantees, mainly in terms of pledging <b>tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> in order to save their contracts while lending to financially constrained firms. Thus, financially constrained firms are likely to invest excess of their internal funds in <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> such as plant, property, and equipment. Possession of more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> makes easy for financially constrained firms to acquire external funds. Several previous studies including Campello & Hackbarth (2012), Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) have suggested that the tangibility of assets increases the capability of financially constrained firms to seek new funds. Almeida & Campello (2007) provided evidence that firms increase their <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> when they are in periods of positive income shocks which in turn increase firms’ capacity for new credit and as a result more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and so on. Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) demonstrated that financially constrained firms are more sensitive to increase the holdings of <b>tangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Therefore, the credit multiplier effect is expected to be more prominent in case of financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms.|$|R
