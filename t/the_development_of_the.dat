40|$|It is {{referred}} on a didactic experience in which pupils aged 11 - 14 face problematic situations which are to them completely new and which concern <b>the</b> plane <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> solid figures. <b>The</b> activity carried out has enabled the pupils to: i) {{have the chance}} and the motivation to make conjectures; ii) acquire good skills in connecting space to plane and refine their spatial intuition; iii) use with awareness, in a "concrete" context, geometric trasformations and their proprerties; iv) use in a spontaneus way notions connected to topological transformations; v) face in a concrete way activities - even complex ones - <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logical combinatorial kind (classifications, partitions, identifications) for <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> a double-entrance table. Among the results achieved by the pupils we underline <b>the</b> following: a) <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cube are exactly 11; b) <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right-angled parallelepiped having the three dimensions different are exactly 54; c) <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right-angled parallelepiped having the two dimensions equal are exactly 29; d) <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right-angled parallelepiped (in both cases (b) and (c) {{can be divided into}} 11 classes corresponding to <b>the</b> 11 <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cube...|$|R
