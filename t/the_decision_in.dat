Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played no role in <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, he was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Menominee Tribe v. United States is a {{landmark}} case in Native American law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights.

The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E

5|$|When the Buffalo nickel {{had been}} struck for 25 years and could be {{replaced}} without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> <b>In</b> January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000.

5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} result of the {{empirical}} investigation on the usefulness of company prospectuses for investment <b>decisions.</b> <b>The</b> invesment <b>decisions</b> are measured <b>in</b> terms of initial returns for <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary stock market, and 15 -day mean adjusted returns after Initial public offering for <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary stock market. The data of the prospectus used are accounting and non-accounting information. Based on the sample of 91 firm-year observations, the result shows that non-accounting information of the prospectus is relevant for <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary stock market.

5|$|During {{the three}} years (1967–69) that this playoff {{structure}} was in effect, there was one use of the tie-breaker system. In 1967, the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts ended the season tied at 11–1–2 for {{the lead in the}} Coastal Division. The Colts came into the last game of the season undefeated, but were beaten by the Rams. Though the Colts shared the best win/loss record in the NFL that year, they failed to advance to the playoffs while three other teams with worse records won their divisions. This event figured into <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> 1970 to include a wild-card team in the playoff tournament after the AFL–NFL merger.|$|E

This decision was announced in the budget speech of 6 April 1965. The maiden flight of the second development batch aircraft, XR220, was due {{on the day of the}} announcement, but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down, coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation, it never happened. Ultimately, only the first prototype, XR219, ever took to the air.

5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress.

In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> <b>In</b> February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E

5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia.

Souter stated that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E
