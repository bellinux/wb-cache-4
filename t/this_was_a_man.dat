500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; <b>This</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most beautiful {{things in the world}} are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E

His funeral service was attended by Michael Jackson, Harry Wayne Casey, Jennifer Valoppi and Nat Kipner. Valoppi, a family friend said, [...] "It was emotional, there was humor. Everybody talked about how <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who really celebrated life and so this was a celebration of his life." [...] Gibb's ex-wife Lulu was reported to have attended his funeral. Kipner, who managed the early Bee Gees career in Australia in 1966 spoke fondly of his memories: [...] "But I had a business in Australia and I didn't want to go. So I gave them their contract back. One of the dumb things I've done", he joked.|$|E

2500|$|Bourguiba then {{contacted}} Hamouda Boussen, {{whom he met}} and {{who used}} to be known for his many contacts. Thanks to his help, Bourguiba found a traineeship, working for Mr. Pietra and Mr. Scemama, who paid him only after two months. Their law firm was located in rue de l'ancienne poste, between the Street of Maltese and Avenue of France. He then lived in Street of Résevoir where he rented an apartment with 300 francs per month. As for Bourguiba, [...] "Nothing mattered. What was necessary over all was to be domiciled in a law office holder {{for the duration of the}} regulatory internship. However, Bourguiba quickly acquired an annoying renowned for his bosses: [...] "It was impossible to continue working with this Bourguiba! <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> the law firm hired for an internship and there he is, stealing customers!". They soon informed him that he had no longer the responsibility of pleadings, henceforth the charge of Mr. Zérah. Bourguiba, instead was charged in writing works. By the end of June 1928, he resigned from the lawyer office.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2006, Feinstein {{confirmed}} {{she would}} vote against Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, though disagreed with filibustering the choice: [...] "When {{it comes to}} filibustering a Supreme Court appointment, {{you really have to}} have something out there, whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> I might disagree with, (but) that doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court." ...|$|R
40|$|Primo Levi's Se questo è un uomo (If <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man)</b> and I sommersi e i salvati (The Drowned and the Saved) present complex {{relations}} to mythological elements, {{which are often}} filtered through Dante's Divine Comedy and are inserted as key components into the autobiographical narration, thus giving it a mythological dimension.

60|$|The Princess {{stood for}} a moment {{on the edge of the}} lawn, {{watching}} Andrew's tall figure as he strode across the marsh toward the village. Never once did he look back or hesitate on his swift, vigorous way. Then she sighed a little and turned away toward the house. After all, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> although he was so far removed from the type she knew and understood.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with dusty {{feet and}} garments, who stood, bare-headed, behind the hedge that divided their patch of garden from the pathway, and leant meekly forward {{as if he}} sought to mingle with their conversation, and waited for his time to speak.

50|$|For years, as {{pastor of}} an affluent, {{suburban}} Catholic parish, Father Tim Farley {{has maintained a}} close relationship with his congregation by delivering folksy homilies filled with practical advice and adhering to clerical policies without waver. One Sunday, his sermon is interrupted by seminarian Mark Dolson, who questions Farley's position on the ordination of women. The older priest charmingly sidesteps the young man but is annoyed that he <b>was</b> placed in <b>an</b> uncomfortable position. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who relies on charm, harmless white lies, and inane jokes when interacting with his parishioners, and he always has been careful not to get involved in controversial issues.|$|R
500|$|... "Triangle" [...] is also {{notable for}} {{featuring}} the first kiss between Mulder and Scully.

Kessenich opined that the kiss built off [...] "the seeds that were planted in the movie ... Scully clearly believes <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> lost in delirium, but Mulder ... is finally beginning to deal with some pretty powerful feelings he has for his partner." [...] Paula Vitaris, on the other hand, was frustrated; she complained [...] "hen are these kisses that are not kisses going to end?" ...|$|R
25|$|In his Church History, Eusebius {{records that}} the writer of <b>this</b> gospel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Mark who was Peter’s interpreter.

60|$|The Prince {{sent away}} his {{carriage}} and walked homeward, greeting {{every now and}} then an acquaintance. He walked cheerfully and with a smile upon his face. There was nothing in his appearance which could possibly have indicated to the closest observer that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had taken death by the hand. At the corner of Regent Street and Pall Mall he overtook Inspector Jacks. He leaned forward at once and touched the detective on the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} clear that he meant it, for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had a full share of the {{optimism}} which characterizes most of {{the inhabitants of the}} Pacific Slope. He smiled reassuringly at his companions; but there was silence for several minutes while Leeson examined the paper and then passed it to Forster. Jimmy, who felt that his opinion would not be particularly valuable, and had noticed the little smile in Valentine's eyes, sat still, looking out through the open window at the shadowy bush beyond Forster's orchard.|$|E
60|$|The {{greeting}} {{was not an}} effusive one in view of {{the difficulties}} and privations of the journey, but neither of Ormsgill's companions had expected anything of that kind from him. It was also noticeable that there was none of the confusion and bustle that usually follows the arrival of a band of carriers. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who went about all he did quietly, and was willing to save his host inconvenience. The priest went with him to a hut, and the boys were disposed of in five minutes, and when they came back Ormsgill dropped into a chair.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> {{one of the}} most famous works of {{literature}} of the Holocaust, Primo Levi describes the group thus: [...] "those Greeks, motionless and silent as the Sphinx, crouched on the ground behind their thick pot of soup". Those members of the community still alive during 1944 made a strong impression on the author. He noted: [...] "Despite their low numbers their contribution to the overall appearance of the camp and the international jargon is spoken is of prime importance". He described a strong patriotic sense among them, writing that their ability to survive in the camps was partly explained by the fact that [...] "they are among the cohesive of the national groups, and from this point of view the most advanced".|$|R

6000|$|... "Already!" [...] exclaimed the boy, {{springing}} to his feet, as Leonillo bounded {{forward to}} meet a stout hardy forester, who was advancing from {{the opposite end of}} the glade. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of the largest and most sinewy mould, his face tanned by sun and wind to a uniform hard ruddy brown, and his shaggy black hair untrimmed, as well as his dark bristly beard. His jerkin was of rough leather, crossed by a belt, sustaining sword and dagger; a bow and arrows were at his back; a huge quarter-staff in his hand; and his whole aspect was that of a ferocious outlaw, whose hand was against every man.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, Jim {{went to see}} his tenants. He dined {{with one}} at noon in an old farm kitchen and {{afterwards}} occupied himself by examining horses, buildings, and agricultural machines. On the whole, he puzzled the small farmers, to whom a landlord of his type was new, although they liked his frankness and answered his direct questions, since {{it was obvious that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who knew how things were done. Some of the tenants who had known his grandfather talked about Jim afterwards and agreed that he had not much in common with the country gentleman; he was like Bernard Dearham, who opened the famous iron mines.|$|E
60|$|On these {{occasions}} {{there was}} one person only who really interested him. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> somewhat over middle age, of singularly noble and distinguished bearing. His brow was furrowed with lines, but they spoke of cares of the past. Benevolence had settled on his face. It was as if, after a weary struggle, the sun had broken through the heavy clouds. He was attired in the ordinary dress of an English gentleman; but once, when {{he raised his head}} to see if it rained, Andrew noticed that he only wore a woollen shirt, without a necktie. As a rule, his well-trimmed, venerable beard hid this from view.|$|E
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> living {{one step at a}} time, playing by his instincts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|R
500|$|When {{it became}} public in early 2005 {{that the book}} would be published, representatives of Morrison {{contacted}} the publishers of the book. Said Rogan to The Irish Times: [...] "There has been contact with the publishers, I know that much. When the news broke {{earlier this year that}} the book was being published, his lawyers asked to see an advance copy of the manuscript. The publishers refused the request. But then <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who when he learnt {{that there was going to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> plaque erected outside his former Belfast home, got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute." [...] The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg, and <b>a</b> 2006 edition <b>was</b> published by Vintage Books. Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison: Under Review 1964–1974, along with Steve Turner, author of the 1993 biography [...]|$|R
2500|$|At a United States Senate hearing, former {{chairman}} Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for [...] "promot {{violence of the}} most degrading kind against women", labeling him as [...] "a rap singer who advocates murder and rape". She specifically cited lyrics from [...] "Kill You", explaining, [...] "He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who <b>is</b> honored by the recording industry". Cheney drew {{a link between the}} Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians that contribute to the United States' culture of violence. [...] Although she stated that she has [...] "long <b>been</b> <b>a</b> vocal supporter of free speech", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.|$|R
