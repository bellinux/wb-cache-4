Thirty-four individuals were preselected for this study, {{and a group}} of 25 volunteers fulfilled the inclusion criteria for joining the initial phase of this research. All of them were healthy without glaucoma. They were asked to lift an 85 % <b>top</b> <b>load</b> in the supine position for 8 times. IOP was measured before and after the exercise.
