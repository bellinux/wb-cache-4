5000|$|The school {{stresses}} {{the need for}} a strong community, and the concept of [...] "seated meals" [...] perfectly exemplifies this belief. Most weekday lunches, as well as dinners on Thursday and either lunches or dinners on Sunday, are [...] "seated:" [...] students sit at a circular <b>table</b> <b>headed</b> <b>by</b> a faculty member, and are served by a student waiter. The composition of these table changes every two weeks so as to allow students to get to know nearly all members of the student body.|$|R
30|$|It {{would be}} unfair to say that {{educational}} ICT has not gone beyond threaded discourse. It has gone far beyond it, perhaps too far. It has gone beyond enhancing the kind of ideational discourse people normally carry on orally and replaced it with discourse carried out according to scripts (Fischer et al. [2013]). The term “script”, as used in current instructional research, is derived from its use by Schank and Abelson ([1977]) in describing frequently experienced social routines such as dining in a restaurant. The principal elements are roles (e.g., head waiter, waiter, customer) and conventional behaviors associated with the roles (e.g., being shown to a <b>table</b> <b>by</b> the <b>head</b> waiter, asking the waiter for the bill {{at the end of the}} meal). These elements continue to dominate scripted instruction, in which assigned roles are common and the scripts prescribe behavioral sequences tied to roles. Such scripts stand in contrast to the emergent character of much human action, including practically everything that would come under the headings of meaningful learning and creative thinking. These often take place within a script framework (for instance, the academic colloquium, which has defined roles and ritualized behavior) but the essence of the activity (for instance, arriving at a theoretical explanation of puzzling data) is invariably emergent and unscripted. Thus the extension of the script concept not just to the outward forms of classroom life (which are often highly ritualized) but to the cognitive and socio-cognitive processes of work with concepts and ideas is an extraordinary leap. The power of the script idea as developed by Schank and Abelson lay in recognizing and describing the more ossified forms of social behavior, the ones where emergence is minimized and predictability is maximized. Scripts offer a good model when applied to a suitable objective, such as learning the etiquette of an unfamiliar culture, but a bad model likely to defeat the purpose when applied to constructive work with concepts and ideas, where emergence is maximized and unpredictability is inherent.|$|R
