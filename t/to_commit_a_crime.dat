5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of conspiring <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem {{where one of the}} suspects' parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, who is about <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing {{it to be the}} only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
25|$|Another 1998 paper {{finds that}} {{juvenile}} criminals {{are at least}} as responsive to criminal sanctions as adults. Sharp drops in crime at the age of maturity suggest that deterrence {{plays an important role in}} the decision <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
25|$|Police may detain {{suspects}} {{for up to}} 10 {{hours without}} an arrest warrant if the authorities have a well-founded belief that the suspects have committed, or are about <b>to</b> <b>commit,</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> or are unable to determine the suspected person's identity.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{intoxication}} on criminal responsibility varies by jurisdiction and offense. The criminal code in question may require proof of {{various levels of}} intent. This may range from premeditation, through various degrees of intent or willingness <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> general recklessness, and finally no intent at all in some instances of strict liability. Intoxication {{may serve as a}} defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes hinge on whether the defendant's intoxication was voluntary or involuntary: the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, {{a conspiracy}} is {{an agreement between}} two or more persons <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> {{at some time in}} the future. Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act must also have been undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability – unless, in some cases, it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts – but may reduce their sentence.|$|E
500|$|Inchoate means [...] "just begun" [...] or [...] "undeveloped", {{and is used}} in English {{criminal}} law to refer to situations where, although a substantial offence has not been committed, the defendant has taken steps to commit it, or encouraged others to do so. These situations are generally divided into three categories; attempts, where the defendant has taken steps [...] "towards carrying out a complete crime", incitement, where the defendant has encouraged others <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> and conspiracy, where the defendant has agreed with others <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> In each case, the defendant [...] "has not himself performed the actus reus but is sufficiently close to doing so, or persuading others to do so, for the law to find it appropriate to punish him".|$|E
50|$|Although Putkonen was {{the last}} person to receive the capital punishment, there was such long period from the crime and his {{sentencing}} to the execution, that he is not the last known person to be sentenced to death during peacetime, nor <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> peacetime <b>crime</b> that lead to a death penalty. Abraham Kaipainen is the last known person <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> peacetime <b>crime</b> that led to a death penalty (murdering his brother on 31 July 1823 in Pieksämäki) and to be sentenced to death by a non-martial court (27 November 1823). Kaipainen was executed on 30 October 1824.|$|R
50|$|In Ruddigore, the baronets are cursed to die {{if they do}} not <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> horrible <b>crime</b> every day, but failing <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> such <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> is <b>committing</b> suicide, <b>a</b> horrible <b>crime</b> (<b>a</b> {{realization}} that brings them all back to life).|$|R
50|$|In {{ancient times}} this would also {{refer to the}} {{children}} of Naa'in, people who were expelled from the tribe due <b>to</b> <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> It also applied {{to the children of}} mothers who simply fell outside of the clan system. Prior to 1900, being a Tenjeraatsaii automatically placed a Gwich’in at the third-lowest rung of the social ladder. They were to some degree ostracized. The second-lowest rung was reserved for war-captured slaves. The lowest social status was that of a banished Naa'in or bushman. The clan system is no longer well known or used among the Gwich'in.|$|R
500|$|As {{a general}} {{principle}} of the law, criminal liability is normally only imposed upon [...] "a blameworthy actor who causes a prohibited harm", and while those who attempt crimes may be blameworthy, {{it can be argued}} that there is no harm caused; attempted burglary, for example, does not lead to anything being stolen. Many theorists who make the distinction between successful and failed attempts do still consider the defendant partially liable, for example advocating a lesser punishment. However, there have been two distinct counterarguments advanced against making such a distinction. The first is that when a crime is attempted, there is a harm, namely a threat to security. Individuals have the right to security, both of themselves and their property, and an attempt <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> infringes on this right. The second is that, regardless of the harm principle, criminal liability for attempts can be justified in utilitarian terms. A person who tries <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> has shown themselves to be dangerous, and must be restrained and rehabilitated to provide a deterrence for them and for others. Although a differing approach is taken in some United States jurisdictions, intervention can happen very early in a conspiracy and the defendants can still be held liable. The earlier the liability, the more controversial.|$|E
500|$|Further {{supporting}} their argument, the dissent cited Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd. {{to argue that}} a Section 1983 claim falls under tort law, in order to draw a distinction between how attempts are handled under tort and criminal law. Under criminal law, a factually impossible attempt <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> such as trying to steal from an empty pocket or defraud someone with no money, can still be tried as an attempt. No such doctrine exists in tort law. Because Heffernan was not engaged in protected activity, the police department could only have attempted to deprive him of his right, so his suit must fail because [...] "there are no attempted torts." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, in some circumstances, the {{partitions}} {{can be used}} to {{described how}} the predictors and the response are related in subject-matter terms. In this cartoon illustration, younger individuals are much more likely <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> violent <b>crime,</b> individuals with more priors are much more likely <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> violent <b>crime,</b> and there looks to be a strong statistical interaction effect between the two. By taking into account the meaning of the predictors that locate the partition lines (e.g., priors more than 2 and age less than 25) the meaning of any associations sometimes can be made more clear. We can learn something about f(X).|$|R

500|$|Attempts {{are governed}} by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, which states that [...] "if, with intent to commit an offence to which , a person does an act {{which is more than}} merely preparatory to the {{commission}} of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence". A required element is intent, or mens rea. In R v Pearman, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act {{is the same as the}} definition in the common law. The common law gives intention [...] "its normal meaning: purpose or aim", with judges advised not to, in the majority of cases, attempt to complicate the definition. Conditional intent [...] where somebody has an intent <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> only in certain circumstances [...] has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime. In Attorney-General's Reference (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979), the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal [...] "anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully". This was a procedural solution to a previous apparent contradiction, but the suggested drafting may not demonstrate sufficient proximity between the defendant's actions and what he was planning to steal. A mens rea requirement is added to the attempt of crimes of strict liability (where there is no intent or merely objective recklessness), although the ruling in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1992) makes this less certain.|$|E
500|$|Some {{exceptions}} are also made for [...] "impossible attempts", which {{are divided into}} legal impossibility, impossibility through ineptitude and physical impossibility. Cases of legal impossibility occur when the defendant attempts to do something which he believes to be illegal, which is in fact not; this does not constitute a crime. This defence does, however, remain for common law conspiracies. Impossibility through ineptitude is where the defendant attempts <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> with inadequate means, in which case he can be found guilty. However, prosecutors' discretion {{is likely to be}} a factor, since some plans [...] for example murder through a voodoo doll [...] may be simply too removed from the attempted crime. Physical impossibility covers situations where not only is the action inadequate, but impossible; an example is the attempted murder of (or conspiracy to murder) someone who is, in fact, already dead. Such actions are governed by section 1(2) and 1(3) of the 1981 Act, which provides that they do constitute a crime if the actions, were the facts of the case to be as the defendant believed them to be, would have led to a valid attempt; as Herring states, [...] "if the defendant believes he is dealing in illegal drugs he can be convicted of an attempted drug-dealing offence, even if in fact what he is selling is chalk". A plan which successfully comes to fruition without the offence the defendant intended coming to pass may also relieve the defendant of liability, although this ruling from Haughton v Smith has proved hard to distinguish from the abolition of other defences of impossibility.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{criminal}} code of New Hampshire, [...] "A person {{is guilty of}} burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied section thereof, with purpose <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> therein, unless the premises are at the time {{open to the public}} or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter." ...|$|E
