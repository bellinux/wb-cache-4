The findings show that <b>the</b> <b>headmaster’s</b> transformative leadersip divides into 70. 64 % average and 29. 36 % below average categories. This implies that that <b>the</b> <b>headmaster’s</b> leadership of <b>the</b> state elementary school (SD) {{in the city of}} Medan remains at the levels of average...|$|R
