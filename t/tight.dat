5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the <b>tight</b> ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. <b>Tight</b> ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland's last regular-season game, {{defensive}} coordinator Chris Cosh and <b>tight</b> ends coach and special teams assistant Danny Pearman announced their resignations. Cosh returned to Kansas State, {{where he had}} coached before Maryland, to assume defensive play-calling duties under recently re-hired head coach Bill Snyder. Danny Pearman returned to his alma mater, Clemson, to work for Dabo Swinney, who had been promoted from offensive coordinator to interim head coach and, finally, head coach for the Tigers. For the bowl game, Maryland's defensive line coach, Al Seamonson, was named as the interim {{defensive coordinator}}. Third-year intern Brian White filled in for Pearman as the interim <b>tight</b> ends coach and would assist head coach Friedgen in running the special teams.|$|E
5|$|After he {{graduated}} from Warren High School in Arkansas, where he played football as a wide receiver, Gragg committed to the University of Arkansas along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the Arkansas Razorbacks football squad, the coaching staff converted Gragg into a <b>tight</b> end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in Bowl Championship Series games and defeated the Kansas State Wildcats in the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic, which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited {{to participate in the}} NFL Scouting Combine, an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest 40-yard dash time and had the second-highest vertical jump among <b>tight</b> ends in attendance; in the draft, the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the St. Louis Rams. One of five <b>tight</b> ends in spring training, he made Buffalo's regular-season roster and played in nine regular-season games during the 2013 NFL season. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before missing the entire 2016 season due to injury.|$|E

5000|$|In American English, the {{difference}} between pantyhose and <b>tights</b> is determined in {{the weight of the}} yarn used and the thickness to which the garment is knitted. Generally, anything up to 40 denier in the leg or overall is known as pantyhose and anything over can be classified as <b>tights,</b> as for example 'running tights' and 'cycling tights'. In the United Kingdom, the word [...] "tights" [...] is used in all cases when referring to pantyhose, and [...] "leggings" [...] for footless <b>tights</b> of heavier, normally opaque material. <b>Tights</b> can be sheer yet solid in colour, whereas leggings are almost or absolute opaque, not sheer. Thus the almost opaque <b>tights</b> are not suited as pants.|$|R

50|$|In hindsight, this {{conclusion}} now seems obvious.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, but before the postseason bowl game, Maryland lost two members of its {{coaching}} staff. On December 5, 2008, the school announced that defensive coordinator Chris Cosh would return to Kansas State to take over as assistant coach and co-defensive coordinator. He joined the staff of the recently re-hired Bill Snyder, who was Kansas State's head coach from 1996 to 2005. Cosh previously served under Snyder as his linebackers coach from 2004 to 2005. For the bowl game, Maryland appointed outside linebackers coach Al Seamonson as the interim defensive coordinator. Maryland also lost its special teams and <b>tight</b> ends coach, Danny Pearman, who was hired by new Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney. Pearman was a Clemson alumnus and played there as a <b>tight</b> end from 1984 to 1987. At Alabama, he coached special teams and the offensive and defensive tackles from 1990 to 1997, during which time Swinney played there as a wide receiver. For Maryland's bowl game, third-year intern Brian White acted as interim <b>tight</b> ends coach, and he assisted head coach Ralph Friedgen in directing the special teams.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and <b>tight</b> street circuits with a long straight and a <b>tight</b> turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E
