500|$|The {{following}} year, Kaif was {{paired with}} Hrithik Roshan in Zoya Akhtar's coming-of-age dramedy Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. The film narrates {{the story of}} three friends on a bachelor trip, and how the workaholism of one was overcome {{with the help of}} Laila (Kaif). The film was a critical and commercial success. Richard Kuipers of Variety commented that she is [...] "delightful as the sweet-natured girl who inspires everyone <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and do something about it". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara {{was one of the most}} awarded films of the year and received numerous Best Film accolades.|$|E

Similarly, in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd. Proposed causes of stuttering have included tickling an infant too much, eating improperly during breastfeeding, allowing an infant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the [...] "work of the devil." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} also {{reviewed}} in The Economist, {{according to which}} [...] "ExxonMobil is easy to caricature, and many critics have done so.... It is to Steve Coll's credit that Private Empire, his new book about ExxonMobil, refuses to subscribe to such a simplistic view." [...] The review describes the company's power {{in dealing with the}} countries in which it drills as [...] "constrained". [...] It notes that the company shut down its operations in Indonesia to distance itself from the abuses committed against the population by that country's army, and that it decided to drill in Chad only after the World Bank agreed to ensure that the oil royalties were used for the population's benefit. [...] The review closes by noting that [...] "A world addicted to ExxonMobil's product needs <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> before being too critical of how relentlessly the company supplies it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert A. Yelle {{is highly}} {{critical}} of Malhotra's approach. According to Yelle, [...] "there is little, if any, original scholarship in the book. It {{is the work of}} a polemicist," [...] who uses western scholarship when criticizing the West, but ignores this scholarship when he presents his own nativist vision of [...] "dharmic traditions." [...] According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism. Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term [...] "dharmic traditions". According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga. Yelle ends his review with the remark {{that there has been a}} gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be willing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and be open to self-criticism.|$|E

She would have got up <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{but the thought of}} the sight of her own face, that was like a twelve-hour clock-dial, filled her with such deep terror, that she hastened to think of {{something}} else.|$|E

Once in the sanctity of her room, which was exactly as she had left it, her first action was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> at her weary, dusty, heated face.

She always knew something was wrong, and at first hid her disorder, as she was ashamed of it, but after 17 years of therapy and 10 years of being medicated for the disorder, she now embraces her mental illness happily by always loving herself.
