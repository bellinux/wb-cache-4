40|$|Abstract. Since {{the seminal}} work of Paturi and Simon [25, FOCS’ 84 & JCSS’ 86], the unboundederror {{classical}} communication complexity of a Boolean function has been studied based on the arrangement of points and hyperplanes. Recently, [13, ICALP’ 07] found that the unbounded-error quantum communication complexity in the one-way communication model can also be investigated using the arrangement, and showed that it is exactly (without a difference of even one qubit) half of the classical one-way communication complexity. In this paper, we extend the arrangement argument to the <b>two-way</b> and <b>simultaneous</b> message passing (SMP) models. As a result, we show similarly tight bounds of the unbounded-error two-way/one-way/SMP quantum/classical communication complexities, implying {{that all of them}} are equivalent up to a multiplicative constant of four. Moreover, the arrangement argument is used to show that the gap between weakly unbounded-error quantum and classical communication complexities is at most a factor of three. ...|$|R

The effects are not uniform for multinational sales and FDI.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new concept, which we call partition expanders. The basic idea is to study quantitative properties of graphs {{in a slightly different}} way {{than it is in the}} standard definition of expanders. While in the definition of expanders it is required that the number of edges between any pair of sufficiently large sets is close to the expected number, we consider partitions and require this condition only for most of the pairs of blocks. As a result, the blocks can be substantially smaller. We show that for some range of parameters, to be a partition expander a random graph needs exponentially smaller degree than any expander would require in order to achieve similar expanding properties. We apply the concept of partition expanders in communication complexity. First, we give a PRG for the SMP model of the optimal seed length, n+O(log k). Second, we compare the model of SMP to that of <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>Two-Way</b> Communication, and give a new separation that is stronger both qualitatively and quantitatively than the previously known ones...|$|R
