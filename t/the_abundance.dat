40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first substantial {{study of the}} chemistry of the envelopes around a sample of 18 low-mass pre- and protostellar objects for which physical properties have previously been derived from radiative transfer modeling of their dust continuum emission. Single-dish line observations of 24 transitions of 9 molecular species (not counting isotopes) including HCO+, N 2 H+, CS, SO, SO 2, HCN, HNC, HC 3 N and CN are reported. The line intensities are used to constrain <b>the</b> molecular <b>abundances</b> by comparison to Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling of the line strengths. An empirical chemical network is constructed {{on the basis of}} correlations between <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> of various species. For example, it is seen that the HCO+ and CO abundances are linearly correlated, both increasing with decreasing envelope mass. Species such as CS, SO and HCN show no trend with envelope mass. In particular no trend is seen between ``evolutionary stage'' of the objects and <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> of <b>the</b> main sulfur- or nitrogen-containing species. Among <b>the</b> nitrogen-bearing species <b>abundances</b> of CN, HNC and HC 3 N are found to be closely correlated, which can be understood from considerations of the chemical network. <b>The</b> CS/SO <b>abundance</b> ratio is found to correlate with <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> of CN and HC 3 N, which may reflect a dependence on <b>the</b> atomic carbon <b>abundance.</b> An anti-correlation is found between the deuteration of HCO+ and HCN, reflecting different temperature dependences for gas-phase deuteration mechanisms. <b>The</b> <b>abundances</b> are compared to other protostellar environments. In particular it is found that <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> in <b>the</b> cold outer envelope of the previously studied class 0 protostar IRAS 16293 - 2422 are in good agreement with <b>the</b> average <b>abundances</b> for <b>the</b> presented sample of class 0 objects.

40|$|In this work, we exploit two assumed {{properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> of <b>the</b> observed signatures (endmembers) {{in order to}} reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> from hyperspectral data. Joint-sparsity is the first property of <b>the</b> <b>abundances,</b> which assumes <b>the</b> adjacent pixels can be expressed as different linear combinations of same materials. The second property is rank-deficiency where the number of endmembers participating in hyperspectral data is very small compared with the dimensionality of spectral library, which means that <b>the</b> <b>abundances</b> matrix of <b>the</b> endmembers is a low-rank matrix. These assumptions lead to an optimization problem for the sparse unmixing model that requires minimizing a combined l 2,p-norm and nuclear norm. We propose a variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Experimental evaluation carried out on synthetic and real hyperspectral data shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms with a better spectral unmixing accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Historically,Ge {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a neutron-capture element. In this case, <b>the</b> r-process <b>abundance</b> of Ge is derived by subtracting <b>the</b> s-process <b>abundance</b> from <b>the</b> total <b>abundance</b> in <b>the</b> Solar system. However, <b>the</b> Ge <b>abundance</b> of <b>the</b> metal-poor star HD 108317 is lower than that of the scaled residual r-process <b>abundance</b> in <b>the</b> Solar system, about 1. 2 dex. In this paper, based on a comparison of <b>the</b> Ge <b>abundances</b> of metal-poor stars and stellar yields, we find that <b>the</b> Ge <b>abundances</b> are not <b>the</b> result of the primary-like yields in massive stars and come mainly from the r-process.
