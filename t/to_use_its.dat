5|$|Visual effects artist Aaron Juntunen {{copied the}} visuals from the Beat-Beat Revelation dance tracks from Dance Dance Revolution by using {{computer}} graphics. The tracks were played live, allowing the actors to dance in unison.

5|$|Because {{the class}} was {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow waters of the Adriatic sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 612 limpet mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) bottom mines or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E

5|$|During the US {{invasion}} of Saipan in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting {{to reinforce the}} defenses were sunk by submarines. Shigenori Kami, chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command Yamashiro to carry troops and equipment to Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship {{before it could be}} sunk and <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> artillery to defend the island. After Ryūnosuke Kusaka, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet, also volunteered to go, Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō approved the plan, known as Operation Y-GO, but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, RBS {{cancelled}} {{its plan}} to spin off Williams & Glyn as a separate business, stating that the new bank could not survive independently. It revealed it would instead seek to sell the division to another bank. In February 2017, HM Treasury and the European Commission reached a provisional agreement in which RBS {{would be able to}} retain the Williams & Glyn assets in return for investing £750 million into a fund aimed at increasing SME lending by challenger banks and for RBS agreeing to allow SME customers of challenger banks <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> branch network for cash and cheque handling. The European Commission confirmed in April 2017 that it would scrutinise the proposal.|$|E
5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system the ability <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E

5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a move that further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the East Kent Railway had ambitions to run {{passenger}} trains between Kent and London, {{but it did}} not own any railway lines in inner London. It reached an agreement with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB) in 1858 <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> West End and Crystal Palace line to access Battersea and (from 1860) Victoria. This arrangement incurred costly access fees, but it was necessary until the company obtained Parliamentary authority to build in London.|$|E
5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> pincers in defense.|$|E

It was Michigan's first BCS bowl game since the 2006 season, when Michigan was defeated by the USC Trojans in the 2007 Rose Bowl. The meeting between the Hokies and the Wolverines was the first between the two schools. Virginia Tech was forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> third-string kicker during the game, as first-string kicker Cody Journell was suspended for the game {{as a result of an}} arrest for breaking-and-entering, while second-string kicker Tyler Weiss was suspended from the game and sent home for missing curfew.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS {{decided it would be}} cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.|$|E
5|$|The Viva Piñata {{team was}} a model for {{productivity}} and regular output within Rare and Microsoft Studios. Though compared to the 12-person teams behind earlier Rare games, the company's Xbox 360 development teams consisted of 50 to 60 people. The Viva Piñata team included about 50 people at its zenith. Microsoft transitioned its development teams <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> XNA package to streamline and reduce duplication in engineering efforts. Microsoft pressured the Viva Piñata development team to keep the game's themes children-friendly, as the parent company planned for the game and resulting franchise to increase the market appeal of their Xbox 360. In 2006, a Microsoft Games executive called the game its most important franchise. But its reception was tepid.|$|E

5|$|The company's ship-naming policy {{throughout}} its 87-year period of operations was <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> home port's name plus a suffix word, often a trade or occupation. The {{most frequently used}} name was Manchester Trader, applied to six different vessels between 1898 and cessation of operations in 1985. Some names used appropriately during the First World War, such as Manchester Hero, Manchester Brigade and Manchester Division were not reused after the disposal or loss of those vessels. Some ships operated short-term or on charter retained their original names and did not receive the Manchester prefix.|$|E
5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>its</b> unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
