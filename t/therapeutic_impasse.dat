40|$|Literature on {{therapeutic}} dilemmas is scarce. Related {{literature on}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse</b> fails to capture therapist experiences {{of being in}} a situation in which any available interventions appear to be counter-therapeutic. This study was a phenomenological investigation of therapists 2 ̆ 7 experiences of being in dilemmas. Results suggest that dilemmas can be characterized by therapists 2 ̆ 7 perceived inability to act juxtaposed with the experienced need to take action. Additionally, three main themes were obtained from this study. The first theme, therapists 2 ̆ 7 experiences {{of being in a}} dilemma, includes both being stuck and generating alternative options. The second theme, therapists 2 ̆ 7 attitudes, was divided into attitudes that reflect compassion and commitment and attitudes that reflect frustration towards the client and/or the situation. The third theme, therapists 2 ̆ 7 personal responses, was divided into the recognition of personal and professional limits and comparisons with past situations. Available writings on <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse</b> suggest that dilemmas may fit definitions of impasse, but not all definitions of impasse fit dilemmas. The main difference is that therapists. experiencing an impasse reported a sense of self-alienation and disconnection, whereas therapists in dilemmas did not consistently report this experience...|$|E

40|$|Anorexia nervosa is {{a complex}} {{pathology}} that regularly leads clinicians to a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse.</b> The origin of this disorder is multifactorial. It occurs most often in adolescence and affects mainly women. Paradoxically, hunger is present but dissociated from adequate food function. Somatic and psychological impact can be particularly heavy. The treatment is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary care. An eclectic and integrative approach, moving away from rigid therapeutic methods and integrating the plurality of techniques, seems to be particularly recommended to increase the chances of therapeutic success. This article summarizes the various theoretical models of anorexia nervosa and its modalities of treatment. Peer reviewe...|$|E
30|$|Introduction In {{intensive}} care units, life-threatening bacillus infections may occur. It {{is a very}} common situation. Probabilist extended-spectrum antibiotic therapy has to be promptly instituted. The spectrum of this antibiotic should include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases enterobacteria. Because of their broad spectrum of action, carbapenems are the standard treatment, especially in cases of nosocomial infections. Lately, bacterial strains have acquired resistance mechanisms to carbapenems, including carbapenemase production. Because of few therapeutic options, the occurrence of bacterial resistance to carbapenems is a real public health problem. The use of carbapenem is limited by expert’s recommendations to limit the risk of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse.</b> The aim is to preserve their effectiveness. The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} incidence and risk factors for resistance acquisition in an {{intensive care}} unit, while rigorously good use of these antibiotics was applied.|$|E
30|$|Results: Among 857 {{patients}} {{discharged from}} the ICU alive, a decision not to re-admit to the ICU during a same hospital stay was noted in the medical file of 63 patients (7.3 %). This decision was primarily made {{on the day of}} discharge (42.6 %), and those involved in the decision included—the family, an outside consultant, and the patient themselves in 54, 31.7 and 15.9 % of cases respectively. The decision was justified in medical terms in 92.1 % of cases, and the main reasons cited were—(1) <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse</b> (52.4 %) + (2) comorbidities (44.4 %) + (3) degree of dependence of the patient (34.9 %). Patients concerned by decisions of this type were generally older (75 vs 65.6  years, p <  0.0001), with more comorbidities (median 4 vs 2, p =  0.001), greater loss of dependence according to Katz’s activities of daily living (5 vs 6, p <  0.0001), and longer duration of life-sustaining therapies (7.5 vs 5  days, p =  0.028).|$|E
40|$|In this article, a {{distinction}} is {{made between the}} outer therapeutic conversation and the therapist's inner conversation. The therapeutic conversation is a circle of meaning in which both the therapist and the clients play a part. The therapist's inner conversation {{is described as a}} negotiation between the self of the therapist and his role. In this process of negotiation the therapist has to take seriously, not only his observations, but also what is evoked in him by these observations, that is, images, moods, emotions, associations, memories, and so on. Furthermore, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse</b> is conceptualized as a paralysis of the circle of meaning and of the therapist's inner conversation. A process of reflection is proposed as {{a way out of the}} impasse. In that process, the inner conversation of the therapist is externalized with the help of an outsider. In the final part of this article, a case study illustrates the importance of these ideas for the family therapy practice. The only person a therapist can change is him- or herself...|$|E
40|$|Client {{engagement}} in psychotherapy {{can be defined}} as intense involvement with the therapy tasks and materials, and presence with the therapist and the self. Client engagement is deemed important in determining the success of the psychotherapeutic process and outcome (Hubble, Duncan and Miller 1999). Client engagement has been investigated most often in the context of its intersection with other client related factors in psychotherapy such as attendance, accessibility, agreement on and completion of the tasks of therapy, or the mutual process of the therapeutic alliance (Tetley et al. 2011; Dew and Bickman 2005). Little is known about clients’ experiences of {{engagement in}} psychotherapy and the key issues for clients therein. In this Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) study, individual interviews were conducted with five clients who attended psychotherapy in a mental health setting with therapists of varied experience and therapeutic orientations. The transcribed interviews were analysed using the analytic method described by Smith, Flowers and Larkin (2009). The study highlights the complex, evolving and dynamic nature of engagement. It particularly illuminates the profound sense of risk of self-annihilation, through death of the physical self or destruction of the psyche that participants grappled with as they navigated a number of key interconnected dilemmas inherent in engaging in psychotherapy. The study contributes to the field by informing practice concerns such as <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse,</b> informed consent and drop-out. It also informs client response to mental health treatment in general in relation to issues such as treatment compliance and decision making. Additionally, the study has implications for training, policy and future research...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 77 - 79). In {{this thesis}} I use {{the case study}} to understand and interpret the manifested transference-countertransference anxiety in the therapy as it was expressed largely through the patient's and the therapist's paranoia. The experience {{of the sense of}} aliveness and deadness in the therapeutic hour, and the function that this interactive space have played in pointing me to my patient's internal object world and her object relations are explored in terms of their usefulness in understanding the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse.</b> I suggest that my patient's 'substitute formations' in the place of good object relating, reflected in the perverse pleasure she obtained from what has been termed 'violent innocence', for some time masked the lifelessness of the analysis. I think the denial of others' perceptions that violent innocence entails to intersubjective theories of mutual recognition, and trace the failure to successfully negotiate the 'crisis of recognition' in early childhood to the maintenance of a magical omnipotence in adult relating. I explore how the domination of intrapsychic contents negatively affects the successful development in the individual of empathy, concern and connected ness. I examine the way in which supportive therapeutic techniques in the therapy of patients with borderline attachment difficulties may well provide temporary adjustments, but run the risk of failing to provide for a higher level of psychic integration beyond support {{for the development of a}} false self. I look at the way in which the false self may emerge as a distortion of the 'dense logics of deception' that are paradoxically involved in the negotiation of a shared reality with others...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} how psychodynamically oriented therapists {{understand and}} work with negative racial sentiments arising in traumatized clients. One of {{the aims of the}} study was to highlight and examine the technical, countertransferencial and ethical dilemmas faced when a patient brings ‘politically difficult’ material infused with negative racial sentiment to therapy. It was hoped that information gleaned would contribute to theoretical and technical understanding of this phenomenon and assist in working with such negative racial sentiments. In order to investigate the research questions eight therapists who identified themselves as ‘psychodynamically-oriented’ participated in semi-structured interviews on the topic of negative racial sentiment (NRS) in therapy. The study was located in the qualitative research tradition, and interview transcripts were subject to a critical thematic content analysis. The main themes were identified and presented under three sections, namely: how therapists understand, work with and respond to the phenomenon of NRS in traumatized clients. Understandings included the formation of NRS as inter alia reflecting the use of defenses such as splitting, projection, projective identification, the triumph of the bad object and a breakdown in the capacity to symbolize. Tensions in understanding the phenomenon of NRS post-trauma and related latent themes were also identified. Therapists’ approaches to working with NRS included the use of a range of implicit assessment criteria such as, whether, for example, the patient’s response was experienced as ego-dystonic or ego-syntonic. Technical strategies for intervention included adherence to a working model, interpretive interventions and cognitive strategies. The participating therapists’ countertransferential responses to negative racial sentiment were categorized, taking the form of: negative feeling towards or disidentification from the patient; negative feeling towards the perpetrator or identification with the patient and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>impasse.</b> Some guidelines proposed by the participating therapists for managing NRS, as it occurs in psychotherapy with traumatized clients, are presented...|$|E
