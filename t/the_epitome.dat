40|$|Studies from {{neuroscience}} {{show that}} part-mapping computations are employed by human visual {{system in the}} process of object recognition. In this paper, we present an approach for analyzing semantic-part characteristics of object category representations. For our experiments, we use category epitome, a recently proposed sketch-based spatial representation for objects. To enable part-importance analysis, we first obtain semantic-part annotations of hand-drawn sketches originally used to construct <b>the</b> <b>epitomes.</b> We then examine {{the extent to which the}} semantic-parts are present in <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> of a category and visualize the relative importance of parts as a word cloud. Finally, we show how such word cloud visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of category-level structural trends that exist in <b>the</b> category <b>epitome</b> object representations. Our method is general in applicability and can also be used to analyze part-based visual object representations for other depiction methods such as photographic images...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} spatial consideration, existing epitome model may fail for image recognition and target de-tection, which directly motivates us to propose <b>the</b> so-called spatialized <b>epitome</b> in this paper. Extended from the orig-inal graphical model of <b>epitome,</b> <b>the</b> spatialized <b>epitome</b> provides a general framework to integrate both appearance and spatial arrangement of patches in the image to achieve a more precise likelihood representation for image(s) and eliminate ambiguities in image reconstruction and recogni-tion. From the extended graphical model of epitome, an EM learning procedure is derived under the framework of vari-ational approximation. The learning procedure can gener-ate an optimized summary of the image appearance with spatial distribution of the similar patches. From <b>the</b> spa-tialized <b>epitome,</b> we present a principled way of inferring the probability of a new input image under the learnt model and thereby enabling image recognition and target detec-tion. We show how the incorporation of spatial information enhances <b>the</b> <b>epitome’s</b> ability for discrimination on several vision tasks, e. g., misalignment/cross-pose face recognition and vehicle detection with a few training samples. 1...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of written sources on this period, much of Nerva's life has {{remained}} obscure. The most substantial surviving account of the reign of Nerva was written by the 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio. His Roman History, which spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229, was composed more than one hundred years after Nerva had died. Further details are added by an abridged biography from <b>the</b> <b>Epitome</b> de Caesaribus, a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor.|$|E
5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} author of <b>the</b> <b>Epitome</b> de Caesaribus offer compressed secular {{political and military}} histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E
5|$|The faction {{was created}} to feud with wrestlers {{who had been a}} part of the {{original}} Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion in the 1990s. WWE revived ECW as a third brand in 2006, and hired several former ECW wrestlers – the ECW Originals – to compete on the brand. In early 2007, the New Breed was created when Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, touted Burke and Cor Von as <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> of the new ECW, while insulting the ECW Originals. Striker, Thorn, and Ariel joined the following week.|$|E

50|$|The Bhagavad Gita—considered one of <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> of {{historic}} Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate {{on what is}} right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as Ahimsa must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.|$|R

5|$|South Indian {{music and}} dances {{such as the}} Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As {{a result of their}} culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained {{popularity}} during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
