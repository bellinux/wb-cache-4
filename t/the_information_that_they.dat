At 15:50, the British fleet had been placed on two hours readiness and at 19:05 were ordered to sail south from Scapa Flow. Around midnight, the Harwich Force (Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt) of three light cruisers and 18destroyers was ordered to move north.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferential}} view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from {{clues about the}} target that the rememberer can piece together.

These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E

25|$|The {{night before}} he was {{scheduled}} to leave Shanghai in June 1931, Xiang Zhongfa, who was one of Zhou's most senior agents, decided {{to spend the night in}} a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings about the danger. In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the French Concession. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General Xiong Shihui, who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.|$|E

Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy.

[...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had.

2500|$|Finally, the EMD {{ensures that}} the {{information}} regarding each call is collected in a consistent manner, for both legal and quality assurance purposes. In most jurisdictions, all EMS records, including both patient care and dispatch records, and also recordings of dispatch radio and telephone conversations, {{are considered to be}} legal documents. Dispatch records are often a subject of interest in legal proceedings, particularly with respect to initial information obtained, statements made by the caller, and response times for resources. Any or all may be demanded by a criminal court or civil court, a public inquiry, or a Coroner's Inquest, and may have to be produced as evidence. It is not uncommon in some jurisdictions for EMDs to be summoned to court, in order to provide evidence regarding their activities. As a result, there is frequently a legal requirement for the long-term storage of such information, and the specific requirements are likely to vary by both country and jurisdiction. [...] Additionally, medical directors will frequently rely on information provided by EMDs for the purpose of medical quality assurance for paramedics; in particular analyzing conversations between paramedics and dispatchers or physicians, analyzing the paramedic's actions and judgments in the light of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were provided with. [...] As a direct result of these two factors, there is a requirement for all call information to be collected and stored in a regular, consistent, and professional manner, and this too, will often fall to the EMD, at least in the initial stages.|$|E

30|$|Following this view, {{at least}} two {{possible}} overarching explanations exist for this turning point (Schroder et al. 1967).
