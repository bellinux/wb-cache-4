25|$|A <b>teleprompter</b> is {{a display}} device that prompts the person {{speaking}} {{with an electronic}} visual text of a speech or script. Using a <b>teleprompter</b> {{is similar to the}} practice of using cue cards. The screen is in front of and usually below the lens of the camera, and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the performer using a sheet of clear glass or specially prepared beam splitter. The <b>teleprompter</b> was invented in 1950 by Hubert Schlafly, who was working at 20th Century Fox film studios in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Loretto, {{on behalf}} of all {{property}} owners so situated, sued Manhattan <b>Teleprompter</b> for trespass and—insofar as <b>Teleprompter</b> relied on § 828—a taking without just compensation, and requested damages and injunctive relief; the City of New York intervened in the case. The New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and rendered summary judgment for Manhattan <b>Teleprompter,</b> finding that non-crossover installations constituted a taking for which just compensation is due, but here the law served a legitimate public purpose there is no significant economic impact on expectations of investors, rejecting the theory that physical presence is per se a taking. The judgment was affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals. Loretto petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, which was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|Loretto v. <b>Teleprompter</b> Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that when the {{character}} of the governmental action is a permanent physical occupation of property, the government actions effects regulatory taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner. In doing so, it established the permanent physical presence test for regulatory takings.|$|E
25|$|In the 1989–90 season, Truddi Chase—a {{woman who}} was {{diagnosed}} with dissociative identity disorder, having 92 distinct personalities—appeared on the show.

After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book When Rabbit Howls, Winfrey unexpectedly broke down in tears while reading the <b>teleprompter,</b> relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August, several online {{newspapers}} {{reported that the}} Anatolian Agency had used {{what seemed to be}} pre-determined election results while doing a practice run for their election night coverage. Leaked images of <b>teleprompter</b> text allegedly showed the Anatolian Agency using pre-determined election turnouts and results which placed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan firmly in first place in six provinces, with 73% in Bartın, 82% in Rize, 80% in Gümüşhane, 70% in Kahramanmaraş, 75% in Konya and 80% in Isparta. However, the authenticity of the leaked images have not been verified and newspapers which reported the news did not name a source.|$|E
2500|$|Returning {{home with}} his wife from {{recording}} [...] "The Bowmans", an episode based around a parody of The Archers, Hancock {{was involved in a}} car accident and was thrown through the windscreen. He was not badly hurt, but suffered concussion and was unable to learn his lines for [...] "The Blood Donor", the next show due to be recorded. The result was that Hancock had to perform by reading from <b>teleprompters,</b> and could be seen looking at camera or away from other actors when delivering lines. From this time onwards, Hancock came to rely on <b>teleprompters</b> instead of learning scripts whenever he had career difficulties.|$|R

25|$|At work, Cindy {{searches}} through {{pictures of}} lighthouses before finding {{the one from}} the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's <b>teleprompter.</b> Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson, and President Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks later}} on August 26, Viacom {{acquired}} Warner Communications and Warner-Amex's combined 50% ownership interest in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. {{as well as}} full ownership of Warner-Amex and the public shareholder interests in MTV Networks for $671.7 million. This gave Viacom exclusive ownership of both premium channels through its $500 million cash payment and acquisition of 1.625 million shares for Warner's 31% stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel, and Warner-Amex's 19% interest in the unit and its 60% interest in MTV Networks (Viacom had owned Showtime alone or jointly with other companies – previously in ventures with <b>TelePrompTer</b> Corporation, and later briefly, its successor Group W Cable – from the time it launched in July 1976). The buyout, part of an option given by Warner in its purchase of American Express' interest in MTV, was exercised in part to finance much of the buyout of Showtime/The Movie Channel without borrowing any money. The subsidiary would eventually be renamed Showtime Networks, Inc. in 1988. Ironically, {{four years after the}} company sold its interests in Showtime and The Movie Channel, Warner Communications would acquire competitors HBO and Cinemax, when the company merged with Time Inc. in 1989 to form Time Warner.|$|E

500|$|According to Liberal {{minister}} Paul Martin Sr. (the {{father of}} the future Prime Minister), St. Laurent {{had the potential to}} be quite good on television, but disliked the medium. He was prejudiced against television appearances, considering such speeches the equivalent of carefully planned performances, such as stage shows. He refused to be made up for the telecasts, and insisted on reading his speech from a script. His advisers switched him to a <b>teleprompter,</b> but this failed to make his performances more relaxed. When reading, he would rarely look at the camera. However, St. Laurent made only occasional television appearances (three in each language), letting his ministers make the remainder. Only one cabinet member, Minister of National Defence Ralph Campney took advantage of the course in television techniques offered by the Liberal Party in a dummy studio in its Ottawa headquarters. This lack of preparation, according to Meisel, led to [...] "a fiasco" [...] during a television address by Minister of Justice Stuart Garson in early June when the <b>teleprompter</b> stopped working during the speech and Garson [...] "was unable to cope effectively with the failure".|$|E

[...] after becoming frustrated by a last-minute alteration to the show's <b>teleprompter</b> text. The band members watched the video clip of this incident repeatedly and decided that it was emblematic of how they wanted to record a live show– without overdubbing in post-production. Personnel in the group for the live show included Wednesday 13 on vocals and guitar, Jason Trioxin on guitar, Nate Manor on bass, and Jonny Chops on drums.|$|E
500|$|The team first {{approached}} the cable television industry, and the prototype {{attracted the attention}} of <b>TelePrompter</b> Corporation, who had seen it during a visit. After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced <b>TelePrompter</b> to back out in April 1968. The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs. It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the [...] "Brown Box" [...] due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing. With the system now largely complete, Baer and Harrison were unsure who to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only RCA was willing to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again. The three creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Marketing Gerry Martin was in favor and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.|$|E
50|$|The TV studios can {{be adapted}} to the needs of various media courses - both live and {{recorded}} television, news and entertainment.

5000|$|While {{returning}} from recording The Bowmans a week earlier, Hancock {{was involved in}} a car accident, and rather than cancel the studio booking it was decided to place <b>teleprompters</b> around the set in order to save the comedian the problems of learning his lines after a delay in rehearsals. In the passage where he is alone looking at the posters, Hancock was obliged to learn his lines. While it is not true Hancock never learned a line from a script again, he increasingly relied on the device mostly thereafter in his TV career. Many Hancock devotees reckon this is one of his poorest TV performances, and it is indeed quite noticeable to see Hancock's eye movements towards the <b>teleprompters</b> when addressing the other performers. Others, though, see no real difference between this and other classic Hancock performances, and lines from the episode have become a part of British comic folklore ("A pint? That's very nearly an armful!" [...] "Rhesus? They're monkeys aren't they?"), giving it now-legendary status.|$|R
25|$|The Court {{held that}} {{regardless}} {{as to whether}} the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner, Manhattan <b>Teleprompter's</b> minor but permanent physical occupation of Loretto's property constituted a regulatory taking of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, reversing the judgment of the lower New York state courts.|$|R
500|$|In her {{performance}} it's always {{clear that a}} finely tuned engine is at work, but what was refreshing here {{was that it was}} in service of a surprisingly casual manner. She made funny, exaggerated faces; twirled her hair (when it was not floating); and spoke to the crowd like a knowing buddy. She was working off a <b>teleprompter</b> for her between-song patter, but improvising frequently, and for the better ... Beyoncé persevere, with a voice that skips up octaves and still gains power, with words that are as compelling as they are straightforward, with legs that treat the stage floor like an enemy in need of a thorough stomping. Even in moments of uncertainty, these are her constants. They survive her missteps.|$|E
500|$|Scientific Atlanta helped NASA {{establish}} ground {{stations for}} communication with astronauts during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects. When John Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in 1962 on Mercury-Atlas 6, his voice was transmitted and received by radio antennas designed and equipment built by Scientific Atlanta. In the 1970s, Robinson recognized the potential combination of communications satellites and cable television. Ted Turner purchased one of Scientific Atlanta's first satellite systems, which {{formed the basis of}} Turner's [...] "Super Station" [...] that was broadcast around the country to other cable providers. In 1975, HBO and <b>TelePrompTer</b> used Scientific Atlanta equipment to transmit the first live satellite-delivered cable event, the [...] "Thrilla in Manila" [...] heavyweight boxing championship bout between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Scientific Atlanta is perhaps best known for pioneering television cable set-top boxes and equipment worldwide and the development of satellite Earth stations.|$|E
500|$|When Lois {{is given}} her {{contract}} {{after getting a}} job at Fox News, she happily runs home in a way reminiscent of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory when that film's protagonist, Charlie Bucket, runs home after receiving his golden ticket.

Later on at the studio, Stewie's broadcast on Fox News is a parody of a viral video clip of an angry Bill O'Reilly during a <b>teleprompter</b> malfunction. When Fred Savage is proven to be Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore, he also reveals himself to be Tony Danza, Camryn Manheim, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Kevin Nealon, John Forsythe, and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.
