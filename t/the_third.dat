Manchester City entered the final as favourites, with Stoke City as underdogs.|$|E

50|$|The two-division format was {{abandoned}} in <b>the</b> <b>Thirds</b> competition, {{in response to}} the increasingly heavy losses which were suffered by first division clubs with weak <b>Thirds</b> teams during <b>the</b> previous season.

5|$|From 189697 until 191920, the Football League and Southern League ran in parallel, {{and were}} {{organised}} by separate bodies. The Southern League was therefore {{not part of}} the English football league pyramid. In 192021, the Southern League First Division was absorbed by the Football League, thus becoming part of the English football pyramid, initially as the Football League Third Division. From 192122 until 195758, <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> Division South operated as <b>the</b> <b>third</b> highest level of English football, running in parallel with <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> Division North. From 195859 until 199192, Division 1 was the highest level of English football, Division 2 the second highest, Division 3 <b>the</b> <b>third</b> highest and Division 4 the fourth highest. The Premier League was formed in 199293, and since then has been the highest level of English football. Division 1 became the second level, and Division 2 <b>the</b> <b>third</b> level. In 200405, Division 1 was renamed as the Football League Championship.|$|E

5000|$|Armitage and Ross later go off {{in search}} of her [...] "father", Dr. Asakura, only to learn he had lost his mind, as {{explained}} by a gentler, reprogrammed version of D'anclaude, living with delusions of creating [...] "Fourths". They learn that <b>the</b> <b>Thirds</b> were originally [...] "assassinroids" [...] - deadly robots with organic components, capable of infiltrating secure facilities by masquerading as humans. This project was re-purposed to bolster the low Martian birth rate, itself a result of Earth's strongly feminist society encouraging the immigration of males and discouraging the immigration of females. However, Earth's discovery of <b>the</b> <b>Thirds</b> incensed its leadership, forcing Mars to reverse its plans; Earth demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Thirds</b> be annihilated, offering female immigrants as a reward - and threatening war if not obeyed. The assassinroid program was thus re-activated to hunt and destroy <b>the</b> <b>Thirds,</b> which had vanished into the Martian population after their creation.|$|R
