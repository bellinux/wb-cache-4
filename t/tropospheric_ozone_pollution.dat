By using a process-based ecosystem model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), {{in conjunction with the}} newly developed driving information on multiple environmental factors (climate, atmospheric CO 2, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition, and land cover/land use change), we quantified spatial and temporal patterns of net primary production (NPP) and soil organic carbon storage (SOC) across China's croplands during 19802005 and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Simulated results showed that both crop NPP and SOC increased from 1980 to 2005, and the highest annual NPP occurred in the Southeast (SE) region (0. 32 Pg C yr- 1, 35. 4 % of the total NPP) whereas the largest annual SOC (2. 29 Pg C yr- 1, 35. 4 % of the total SOC) was found in the Northeast (NE) region.

40|$|A precise {{knowledge}} of ozone seasonal evolution and photochemical production regime in polluted troposphere in China has important policy implications for <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> controls especially in megacities where <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> is common throughout the year. In this study, we used <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> CO and HCHO columns derived from high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTS) in Hefei, China, tropospheric NO 2 columns deduced from overpass Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), surface meteorological data, and a back trajectory cluster analysis technique to investigate ozone seasonal evolution and photochemical production regime in eastern China from 2014 – 2017. A pronounced seasonal cycle for <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is captured by FTS, where {{high levels of}} <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> occurs in spring and summer, {{and low levels of}} <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> occurs in autumn and winter. Day-to-day variations in spring and summer are in most cases larger than those in autumn and winter. At the same time, it shows that the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> roughly increases over time at the first half year and reaches the maximum in June, and then it decreases over time at the second half year. <b>Tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> columns in June are, on average, 0. 5 × 10 18  molecules*cm − 2 (47. 6  %) higher than those in December which has a mean value of 1. 05 × 1018  molecules*cm − 2. The OMI time series shows similar behaviour. The measured features can basically be reproduced by GEOS-Chem and WRF-Chem data but with slight shifts in the timing of the seasonal maximum. Back trajectories analysis shows that: air pollutions in megacities in central-southern China, northwest China, and the key pollution area, i. e., Yangtze River Delta area in eastern China, dominates the contributions to the observed <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels, while the contributions from the other two key pollution areas, i. e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in north China and Pearl River Delta in south China, are very small; Air masses generated from polluted areas have more transportations to the observed area in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, and hence have more contributions to the observed <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels. Correlations between <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and meteorological data disclosed that spring and summer is more favorable to photochemical ozone production than in autumn and winter. Finally, the HCHO/NO 2 ratio is used as a proxy to investigate the chemical sensitivity of ozone production (PO 3).

On-road diesel vehicles produce approximately 20 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x), which are key PM 2. 5 and ozone precursors. Regulated NO x emission limits in leading markets have been progressively tightened, but current diesel vehicles emit far more NO x under real-world operating conditions than during laboratory certification testing. Here {{we show that}} across 11 markets, representing approximately 80 per cent of global diesel vehicle sales, nearly one-third of on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicle emissions and over half of on-road light-duty diesel vehicle emissions are in excess of certification limits.

Heavy-duty vehicles are the dominant contributor to excess diesel NO x emissions and associated health impacts in almost all regions. Adopting and enforcing next-generation standards (more stringent than Euro 6 /VI) could nearly eliminate real-world diesel-related NO x emissions in these markets, avoiding approximately 174, 000 global PM 2. 5 - and ozone-related premature deaths in 2040.

With over 220 member scientists and air quality specialists from 36 nations, TOAR’s mission is to provide the research community with an up-to-date scientific assessment of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone’s</b> global distribution and trends from the surface to the tropopause. TOAR has also built the world’s largest database of surface ozone observations and generated ozone exposure and dose metrics at thousands of measurement sites around the world, freely accessible for research on the global-scale impact of ozone on climate, human health and crop/ecosystem productivity. Plots of these metrics show the regions of the world with the greatest ozone exposure for humans and crops/ecosystems, at least in areas where observations are available. The results also highlight regions where air quality is improving and where it has degraded. TOAR has also conducted the first intercomparison of <b>tropospheric</b> column <b>ozone</b> from ozonesondes and multiple satellite instruments, which provide similar estimates of the present-day <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> burden...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> is a world-wide problem, {{based on}} studies {{reported}} from locations {{as diverse as}} India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Germany, Spain, Greece, Canada, and the United States. Ozone is a serious pollutant in the troposphere due to its adverse effects {{on the health of}} plants, and on the respiratory systems, eyes, and mucous membranes of humans. Due to the seriousness of the issue, the ozone problem in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area was investigated. A review of the literature revealed a research deficiency, since no environment-to-circulation analysis of the ozone problem in the Atlanta metropolitan area could be found. Therefore such a study was conducted, in order to determine how high ozone days in Atlanta were related to atmospheric patterns and meteorological variables. Statistical analysis of radiosonde data, and data from eleven air quality monitoring stations in metropolitan Atlanta, for the summer months of 2000 - 2003, revealed a relationship between high ozone days and both high- and low- pressure patterns, as well as between high ozone days and higher temperature and lower dew point temperature. The data revealed two groups of stations differentiated by geography, and also suggested transport of precursor chemicals as a factor at some stations. This research may assist policy-makers as well as policy-implementers in elucidating associations or mechanisms that can assist efforts to reduce tropospheric ozone concentrations in the Atlanta area...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies have}} linked <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> and human mortality. Although {{research}} has shown that this relation is not confounded by particulate matter when measured by mass, little scientific evi-dence exists on whether confounding exists by chemical components of the particle mixture. Using mortality and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2. 5 µm (PM 2. 5) component data from 57 US communities (2000 – 2005), the authors investigate whether the ozone-mortality relation is confounded by 7 components of PM 2. 5 : sulfate, nitrate, silicon, elemental carbon, organic carbon matter, sodium ion, and ammonium. Together, these components constitute most PM 2. 5 mass in the United States. Estimates of the effect of ozone on mortality were almost identical before and after controlling for the 7 components of PM 2. 5 considered (mortality increase/ 10 -ppb ozone increase, before and after controlling: ammonium, 0. 34 % vs. 0. 35 %; elemental carbon, 0. 36 % vs. 0. 37 %; nitrate, 0. 27 % vs. 0. 26 %; organic carbon matter, 0. 34 % vs. 0. 31 %; silicon, 0. 36 % vs. 0. 37 %; sodium ion, 0. 21 % vs. 0. 18 %; and sulfate, 0. 35 % vs. 0. 38 %). Additionally, correlations were weak between ozone and each particu-late component across all communities. Previous research found that the ozone-mortality relation is not con-founded by particulate matter measured by mass; this national study indicates that the relation is also robust to control for specific components of PM 2. 5. air pollution; confounding factors; mortality; ozone; particulate matte...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of seven main sections. It {{starts with the}} description of the problem which is the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> and its harmful effects on agriculture. Then are described the aims and the objectives ofthe study and how it is going to contribute in the current state ofknowledge. The chapter which follows it is dedicated to the scientific explanation of the problem mainly focusing on ozone formation and its hazards followed by an analytical and critical review of the past literature on the subject concentration on its defects and gaps. The third section describes the sources and the form of trial plot, farm and ozone data along with summary statistics. In this section are also explained the interpolation techniques which were used to develop the ozone maps for Great Britain for the period for which this study is carried out. Section four describes and explains the different econometric and statistical techniques such as panel data techniques, fixed and random effects, error components etc which are used in the following sections to derive the results The next two sections are presenting and interpreting the results from the winter wheat trial plot yields and farms. First are reported all the trial plot results. How ozone is affecting the yields and how the different varieties respond to it. Also explains how the effect changes through time. Then are reported the results from t~. e farm level study. Fanus which produce different types of products are used to measure the effect of ozone on annual production functions, followed by the effect for the entire period and then on the effect oI, 1 productivity and efficiency ofthe farms. The last section compares the results from trial plots and farms and it makes suggestions on how these findings could help in future policy makingEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
25|$|The annual {{global warming}} {{potential}} of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is between 918–1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent/tons <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a radiative forcing effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as carbon dioxide.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, we have {{developed}} two new <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> retrievals from the TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) satellite instrument that are of sufficient resolution to follow pollution episodes. The modified-residual technique [Hudson and Thompson, 1998; Thompson and Hudson, 1999] uses v. 7 TOMS total ozone and is applicable to tropical regimes in which the wave-one pattern in total ozone is observed. The TOMS-direct method [("TDOT" = TOMS Direct Ozone in the Troposphere; Frolov et al., 2000] represents a new algorithm that uses TOMS radiances directly (i. e., not previously processed for TOMS <b>ozone)</b> to extract <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> in regions of constant stratospheric <b>ozone</b> and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> displaying high mixing ratios and variability characteristic of pollution. These events tend to occur in certain meteorological regimes. For example, mid-latitude pollution usually occurs on the backside of subtropical fronts, as low pv, usually moist air intrudes to the extra-tropics. July 1999 was a month characterized by robust pollution in the eastern US, with high ozone, as detected by TOMS, originating over south central states and moving up the Atlantic seaboard. This corresponds to 50 - 80 DU in <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> column depth. In most cases, further transport occurred to the North Atlantic, with ozone plumes traveling to western Europe in 4 - 5 days. Examples of high ozone and transit across boundaries within the US, as well as US->Europe, give a regional context for model results and field measurements taken in the SE US during the Nashville- 1999 campaign period. Validation of the TDOT maps is made with ozonesondes taken during that time. TDOT maps also show <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> from Asia traveling to the western US in July 1999...|$|R
40|$|Arable {{soils are}} a {{significant}} source of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> and thereby contribute to <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution.</b> However, their actual impact on ozone formation is strongly related to their spatial and temporal emission patterns, which warrant high-resolution estimates. Here, we combined an agro-ecosystem model and geo-referenced databases to map these sources over the 12 000 km 2 administrative region surrounding Paris, France, with a kilometric level resolution. The six most frequent arable crop species were simulated, with emission rates ranging from 1. 4 kg N–NO ha- 1 yr- 1 to 11. 1 kg N–NO ha- 1 yr- 1. The overall emission factor for fertilizer-derived NO emissions was 1. 7 %, while background emissions contributed half of the total NO efflux. Emissions were strongly seasonal, being highest in spring due to fertilizer inputs. They were mostly sensitive to soil type, crops' growing season and fertilizer N rates. The use of an agro-ecosystem model at regional scale makes it possible to map the emissions of nitric oxide from arable soils at a resolution compatible with <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> models...|$|R
