5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

Seyfried {{said it was a}} relief to play the nerdy character opposite Fox. [...] "Being a lead (like Megan), you have that weird pressure of feeling like you have to look attractive," [...] she stated. [...] "In this movie, I didn't worry about any of that [...] I don't want to play the one <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> supposed to want to have sex with." ...|$|E
500|$|Lauer {{thought that}} the surge in {{interest}} in bacon products prior to the book's publication was [...] "media driven". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be [...] "the one thing that people are unwilling to give up". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit {{an end to the}} trend of interest in bacon. She commented, [...] "Bacon is something <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it— that sweet and salty combination of flavors." [...] She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. [...] "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon," [...] said Lauer. She stated that [...] "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen." [...] The book was marketed as the [...] "most comprehensive book about bacon to date". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).|$|E

2500|$|Some {{feel that}} speed dating has some obvious {{advantages}} over most other venues for meeting people, such as bars, discotheques, etc. in <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> purportedly there to meet someone, they are grouped into compatible age ranges, it is time-efficient, and the structured interaction {{eliminates the need}} to introduce oneself. [...] Unlike many bars, a speed dating event will, by necessity, be quiet enough for people to talk comfortably. Speed dating is for singles.|$|E
2500|$|John Doyle, The Globe and Mail (July 12, 2002) — An {{absolute}} delight … What's fun here is <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> {{having a}} great time with the arch dialogue, fabulous clothes and general silliness. It's all done with such flair and good humour that you can't help being absorbed. Most of the guys are [...] "saps," [...] all of the women are [...] "dames" [...] and, as Archie Goodwin, Timothy Hutton obviously adores saying things like, [...] "The hell of it was, she was beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

2500|$|Obama stated on March 15, 2007, that [...] "I do not agree...that {{homosexuality}} is immoral." [...] During the July 23, 2007 CNN/YouTube debate, Obama further stated that [...] "... we've {{got to make}} sure <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> equal under the law. And the civil unions that I proposed would be equivalent in terms of making sure that all the rights that are conferred by the state are equal for same-sex couples as well as for heterosexual couples." [...] Obama supports expanding the protections afforded by hate crimes statutes to cover crimes committed against individuals because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Obama also called for full equality for gays during his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013: [...] "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law — for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well." [...] This {{was the first time that}} a president mentioned gay rights or the word gay in an inaugural address.|$|E
60|$|And thus it is, {{not only}} with the Bores and Bounders, but even with us who are not Bores or Bounders. Society in all ranks is founded on the make-believe <b>that</b> <b>{{everybody}}</b> <b>is</b> charming; that we are delighted to see everybody; <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> delighted to see us; that it is so good of everybody to come; that we are desolate at the thought that they really must go now.|$|E

50|$|The {{enthusiastic}} and able young men as proved in their later work were doubtless as {{influential in the}} office later as were these early ones but Wright's early concentration on publicity and his claims <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> his disciple had a deadening influence on the Chicago group and only after {{a quarter of a}} century do we find creative architecture conspicuously evident in the United States.|$|R
