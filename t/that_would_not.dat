5|$|According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not {{including}} rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) {{were used}} in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals {{were used in}} procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be relieved.|$|E
5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
25|$|The New Wafd Party stated on 27 January 2014 <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{nominate}} {{anyone for}} presidency. The Free Egyptians Party announced on 27 April 2014 <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> nominate any members to presidential elections.

50|$|After Pataki {{announced}} in 2005 <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> seek reelection, Donohue {{was seen as}} a possible candidate for governor. However, she later announced <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> run for office in 2006 either.|$|R
5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{have been used to}} address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|Further, critics {{question}} the exact {{purpose of the}} scheme. It is unclear as to whether NCMPs serve to represent the minority in the first-past-the post system, or is an apparent representation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> affect PAP's decision-making. Nevertheless, it {{still seems to be}} a mechanism for representation of the minority opposition.|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} experiments on element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium.

5|$|Montagu {{outlined}} three {{criteria for}} the document that contained {{the details of the}} falsified plans to land in the Balkans.

5|$|Not feeling {{qualified}} {{to write the}} script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson.

5|$|The 200 {{members of}} the {{parliament}} are elected using the proportional D'Hondt method through which voters cast their vote for a candidate of their choosing within a party list.

As part of cost-cutting measures amid declining print advertising revenue, the Sunday edition ceased publication in April 2016. It was replaced by a lifestyle and culture magazine called J+, which is included with the newspaper's Saturday edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects on}} the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only {{confirming}} the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating {{on the construction of}} several new ships in Italian seaports <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action {{of the year in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
5000|$|After Umar's death, Atiqa married Zubayr ibn al-Awam.

60|$|Lord Cashel {{knew that}} delay was death in this case, so he pished, and hummed, and hawed; quite lost the dignity {{on which he}} piqued himself, and ended by declaring <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> interfere; <b>that</b> they might do as they liked; <b>that</b> young people <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be guided, and <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> make himself unhappy about them.

5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected {{samples of the}} escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E

5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a ground survey was carried out as well to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be flooded, but the lake would turn it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway.|$|E
