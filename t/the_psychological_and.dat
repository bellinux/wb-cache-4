5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E

His study focuses heavily on Hitler’s relationship to his mother, Klara. Stierlin felt that Hitler's mother had frustrated hopes for herself that she strongly delegated to her son, even though for him, too, they were impossible to satisfy.|$|E

40|$|Little {{research}} has connected <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> sport. Therefore, {{the content of}} <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract of rugby team members was analysed and the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perceived performance of rugby team members was determined. A longitudinal research design was chosen, along with a non-probability sampling technique. The sample consisted of rugby team members from a prominent rugby playing university in South Africa. A <b>psychological</b> contract questionnaire <b>and</b> perceived performance questionnaire were used. From the research, the content of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract of rugby team members was determined. The results indicated no correlation between <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> perceived performance, however, a strong correlation was found between Institute Obligations and Player Obligations. Another factor, which remains to be investigated, is leadership and the perceived performance of a rugby team[URL]...|$|R

25|$|Psychoacoustics is the {{scientific}} study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> physiological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics. Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.|$|E
25|$|An earlier {{example of}} {{psychodrama}} was The Pawnbroker in 1964, starring Rod Steiger. In it, Steiger played a Holocaust survivor whose spirit {{had been broken}} and lives day-to-day as a pawn shop owner in Harlem. Lumet used the film to examine, with occasional flashbacks, <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> spiritual scars Steiger's character lives with, including his lost capacity to feel pleasure. Steiger, who has made nearly 80 films, said during a TV interview that the film was his favorite as an actor.|$|E
25|$|Psychoacoustics is the {{scientific}} study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music). Topics of study include perception of the pitch, timbre, loudness and duration of musical sounds and the relevance of such studies for music cognition or the perceived structure of music; and auditory illusions and how humans localize sound, which can have relevance for musical composition and the design of venues for music performance. Psychoacoustics is a branch of psychophysics.|$|E
40|$|Rationale In {{the current}} {{literature}} there lies {{a shortage of}} qualitative experiential data on <b>the</b> transpersonal <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> parapsychological aspects of the ayahuasca experience. Data on ayahuasca users from Western civilisation is limited. There is an understudy of transformation and ayahuasca drug usage. Aim This study aims to collect qualitative data on <b>the</b> transpersonal <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> parapsychological aspects of the ayahuasca experience from Western users...|$|R

25|$|The {{increasing}} number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It {{is caused by the}} extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. <b>The</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} balance between <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> the supernatural {{in such a}} way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|As a {{theoretical}} or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical, being correlated {{on the one}} hand to physical science and on the other to history. Its method is {{the same as that of}} physical science, being distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal, and <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of the ethical process is that nature (i.e. all that is not mind, the human body as well as external nature) may become the perfect symbol and organ of mind.|$|E
40|$|A {{psychological}} {{archive of}} a university student {{is the basis for}} <b>the</b> <b>psychological,</b> ideological <b>and</b> moral education {{of a university}}, and the foundation for a student to develop his or her self-consciousness.

These obstacles must be overcome to smoothly realize <b>the</b> value of <b>psychological</b> files...|$|R

25|$|These new {{developments}} mark {{a milestone in}} expanding {{the role of the}} government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of “family” and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will {{have a better understanding of}} <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
25|$|Psycholinguistics or {{psychology}} of language {{is the study}} of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many and varied {{references}} to the Marquis de Sade in popular culture, including fictional works and biographies. The eponym of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> subcultural term , his name is used variously to evoke sexual violence, licentiousness, and freedom of speech. In modern culture his works are simultaneously viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica. Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, which caused him to become imprisoned. He thus {{became a symbol of}} the artist's struggle with the censor. Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of sadism. Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by artists and intellectuals because they espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Sociology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} influence of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> leadership styles on the perceived performance of semi-professional rugby teams. Little research has connected <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> sport, and little research has investigated the effect of specific leader behaviours {{on the performance of}} sport teams. It was therefore the objective of this dissertation to analyse the content of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract of rugby team members, and to determine the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perceived performance of rugby team members. This dissertation also set out to analyse the content of the preferred leadership style of the team captain and the own leadership style of team members, and to determine the correlation between leadership styles and perceived performance. A longitudinal research design was chosen, along with a non-probability sampling technique. The sample consisted of rugby team members from a prominent rugby-playing university in South Africa. Questionnaires were used to investigate the content of <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> preferred leadership style and own leadership style, as well as their relationship to perceived performance. The results indicated no correlation between <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> contract <b>and</b> perceived performance, nor any correlation between leadership styles and perceived performance. A strong correlation, on the other hand, was found between the preferred leadership style of the team captain and the own leadership style of team members. A strong correlation between institute obligations and player obligations was also established. Master...|$|R
