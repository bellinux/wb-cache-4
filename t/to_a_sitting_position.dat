5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> near his {{original}} position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{procedural step}} in forming the new breast is the collecting and the joining {{of the three}} folds of breast tissue (the medial pillar and the two lateral pillars) of the lower pole of the breast, where it meets the chest. The suturing is critical to supporting and shaping the flaccid breast tissues into a hemispheric breast-mound that well projects from the chest wall—a lifted breast. The supine patient then is elevated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> so that the breasts drape naturally, and the surgeon then delineates upon them the incision plan for the resection (cutting and removing) of the excess folds of skin from the lower sides (inferolateral) and the lower midline (inferomedial) of the new breast. Afterwards, the patient is laid supine, and the excess breast skin is cut; to avoid a scar at the inframammary fold, a purse-string closure gathers the excess folds of skin at the lower pole of the breast; in due course, the three joined pillars of skin will integrate to the inframammary fold. Again, the supine patient is elevated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> so that the surgeon can ascertain the size, shape, and symmetry, or asymmetry, of the corrected breasts. If the degree of breast-lift is satisfactory, the patient is re-laid to the operating table, and the plastic surgeon sutures the incision wounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{patient is}} laid supine upon the {{operating}} table so that the surgeon can later raise her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> that will allow visual comparison of the drape of the breasts, and an accurate assessment of the post-operative symmetry of the reduced and lifted bust. Afterwards, the pedicle epidermis surrounding the NAC (nipple-areola complex) is cut, and adipose tissue is liposuctioned from the breast. The medial, lower, and lateral segments of the breast are resected (cut and removed), by undermining the skin below the lower curved line. Then, the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere. The pillars of parenchymal tissue are approximated (joined), and the skin envelope is sutured.|$|E
50|$|This roll starts {{by sitting}} on the floor in a {{straddle}} position. The legs are held below the knees and the body leans over towards the shoulder on one side. The gymnast then folds more tightly until they roll over their back and return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> straddle <b>position.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wheelchair {{stretchers}} are {{a variant}} of wheeled stretchers/gurneys that can accommodate <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> patient, or be adjusted to lie flat {{to help in the}} lateral (or supine) transfer of a patient from <b>a</b> bed <b>to</b> the chair or back. Once transferred, the stretcher can be adjusted to allow the patient <b>to</b> assume <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But here,"--said I--"here"--and I dragged spitefully {{from its}} {{receptacle}} a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose remarkable appearance struck {{me with a}} sense of unwelcome familiarity--"here is <b>a</b> wretch entitled <b>to</b> no earthly commiseration." [...] Thus saying, in order <b>to</b> obtain <b>a</b> more distinct view of my subject, I applied my thumb and forefinger to its nose, and causing it <b>to</b> assume <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> upon the ground, held it thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued my soliloquy.|$|R

60|$|I was {{too much}} {{confused}} to make any intelligent reply. Rising <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> I gazed around.|$|E
60|$|Jack had now {{managed to}} raise himself <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> {{and he looked}} at the Saw-Horse with much interest.|$|E
5000|$|Dufner's laid-back mannerisms {{have led}} to the term [...] "Dufnering," [...] which {{specifically}} refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slumped <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> with <b>an</b> expressionless face. The term originated in March 2013 after a photo went public of Dufner slumping without expression while visiting a youth center in Irving, Texas. Afterward, Keegan Bradley and several other professional golfers good-naturedly mocked Dufner through Twitter and other social media, and [...] "Dufnering" [...] rapidly became a popular phenomenon.|$|R
50|$|A common assistive {{technology}} intervention is specialized seating and postural control. For children with poor postural control, a comfortable seating system that {{provides them with}} the support needed <b>to</b> maintain <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> can be essential for raising their overall level of well-being. A child's well-being in a productive sense involves the ability to participate in classroom and play activities. Specialized wheelchair seating {{has been identified as}} the most common prescription in the management of scoliosis in teenagers with muscular dystrophy.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler applies a front facelock {{and then}} falls backwards, {{much like a}} normal DDT, but instead of the opponent's head {{impacting}} the mat, the wrestler falls <b>to</b> <b>a</b> kneeling or <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> driving {{the face of the}} opponent on to his/her knee.|$|R
60|$|The two men {{raised the}} captain <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> He was now breathing, though in gasps, {{with his eyes}} opened.|$|E

60|$|She {{set down}} the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently he woke up, rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> and rubbed his eyes briskly.|$|E
50|$|Midwives {{performed}} intrauterine examinations {{to inspect}} {{if the child}} was appropriately head first in the birth canal. If the child were not in a proper position midwives would attempt to manipulate the child by hand. Women were allowed <b>to</b> labor in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> if they felt that was comfortable for them.|$|R
30|$|Regarding her motor abilities, {{she is able}} <b>to</b> creep in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> stay on her knees, descend low {{staircase}} steps, {{stand up}} with support, and hold objects, usually with the left hand, which is more efficient. She uses an adapted wheelchair, either moving {{it on her own}} or being pulled by someone else.|$|R

6000|$|... "Matt, is {{it really}} you, or is this {{another one of those}} tantalizing dreams?" [...] asked Mr. Lincoln feebly, as he essayed to rise <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, hardly!" [...] murmured Tom, as {{he helped}} her <b>to,</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> [...] "You're coming in on us fast. What's the trouble? Oh, and there is Grace and your father!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Swann rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> and his {{demeanour}} was so alarming {{that the}} nurse, hastening over to him, entreated him to lie down, and waved Hardy peremptorily from the room.|$|E
2500|$|In para-Nordic skiing, the IPC defines {{this class}} as for [...] "those with {{impairments}} {{in the lower}} limb(s) and the trunk." [...] Cross Country Canada defines this para-Nordic classification as [...] "Impairment in the lower limbs and trunk with minimal trunk muscle activity in flexion and extension and no functional sitting balance. [...] athlete is unable <b>to</b> stand." [...] <b>A</b> skier in this class [...] "will have minimal trunk muscle activity in flexion and extension so that the athlete is unable <b>to</b> maintain <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> against gravity while properly strapped to the test table and without arm support".|$|R
50|$|In this {{variation}} of a muscle buster, which focuses {{more of the}} attack on the neck, a wrestler holds his or her opponent upside-down, with both legs hooked and with the back of the opponent's neck against the wrestler's shoulder and then drops <b>to</b> <b>a</b> kneeling or <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> so that the opponent’s neck hits against the shoulder. It is usually performed against an opponent who is sitting on the top turnbuckle.|$|R
25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes {{from his mouth}} when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging {{out of the side}} of its mouth. Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates <b>to</b> mate in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
60|$|Masterton {{tried to}} rise, but another groan escaped him. He {{was really in}} pain. Cissy's bright eyes softened. She knelt beside him, her soft breath fanning his hair, and lifted him gently <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} more the two {{horsemen}} were galloping away. Dick watched {{them until they}} were lost to view, then dropped <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> on a flat rock in the centre of a clump of trees.|$|E
6000|$|Lize {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> [...] "There's some {{mistake about}} this. Ross Cavanagh never was the whifflin' kind of man. You've {{got to remember}} he's on duty. Probably the letter was some order that carried him right back to his work." ...|$|E
50|$|A backbreaker move {{in which}} the wrestler lifts an {{opponent}} up into an Argentine backbreaker or a overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack, so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. The attacking wrestler then drops <b>to</b> <b>a</b> kneeling or <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> while maintaining the hold, thus jarring {{the back of the}} opponent by driving the opponent's spine into the attacking wrestler's shoulder.|$|R
50|$|An {{elevated}} neckbreaker {{refers to}} any neckbreaker performed on an opponent who is held on an elevated position. Normally a wrestler places the opponent on the turnbuckle {{so that they}} face away from the ring. The wrestler takes hold of the opponent by their neck, and from this position performs many variations of the neckbreaker, like falling <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> or kneeling <b>position,</b> or just running forward and pulling the opponent away from the corner, and dropping them in a standard neckbreaker. There are also double team variations.|$|R
50|$|Shihan Mato or Shihan-Mato (四半的) is a Japanese {{style of}} archery, {{employing}} a short bow, with the archer shooting from <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> It is <b>a</b> separate style completely independent of and {{quite different from}} the other style of Japanese traditional archery, Kyudo. The style originated from what was the domain of the Shimazu clan (in modern-day Miyazaki Prefecture). It is sometimes referred <b>to</b> as <b>a</b> peasant style of archery. The Shimazu lord created the style so as to be able to arm his peasantry with bow, and thus increase the amount of archers in his forces. However, at the same time, so as to limit their ability to use the bows in a rebellion, the peasants were told <b>to</b> practice from <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A woman--Eurasian--rises <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> on a cot and blinks sleepily at the Police. Then {{she throws}} herself {{down with a}} grunt. [...] "What's the matter with you?" [...] "I live in Markiss Lane and"--this with intense gravity--"I'm so drunk." [...] She has a rather {{striking}} gipsy-like face, but her language might be improved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stealer of balus!" [...] he cried. The panther rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> his bared fangs but a {{few feet}} from the ape-man's taunting face. Tarzan growled hideously and struck at the cat's face with his knife. [...] "I am Tarzan of the Apes," [...] he roared. [...] "This is Tarzan's lair. Go, or I will kill you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> {{lifted the}} bottle to my lips, and drank from it. Oh! that drink of cool, pure water! never had I tasted anything so delicious. With the first gulp I felt life flow back into me. But wisely enough {{she would not}} let me have much. [...] "No more! no more!" [...] she said, and dragged the bottle from me almost by force.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Copenhagen Suborbitals {{settled on}} the basic design for their first crewed rocket and space capsule. The rocket will be named Spica, and will stand 12-14 m tall with a {{diameter}} of 950 mm. It will be powered by the BPM-100 engine class, using liquid oxygen as oxidizer and ethanol as fuel, producing 100 kiloNewtons of thrust. It's likely to feature pressure blow down tanks, optimised by a dynamic pressure regulation (DPR) system, but turbo pumps are also a possibility, albeit they {{are very difficult to}} build. Flight control will be thrust vectoring via a gimbal engine. The rocket will be fully guided by homebuilt electronics and software. Most of the systems and technology will initially be tested on the smaller Nexø class rockets in 2016/17. The space capsule will be of a tubular design as its predecessor Tycho Brahe, but its greater diameter will allow the astronaut <b>to</b> assume <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> during launch and re-entry, in order to withstand the G-forces.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Tiger Driver '98. In this piledriver, a wrestler will bend his {{opponent}} forward, placing the opponent's head between the wrestler's legs (a standing head scissors), and hooks each of the opponent's arms behind the opponent's back. He then pulls back on the opponent's arms lifting him/her up so that the opponent is held upside down facing {{in the same direction}} as the wrestler, the wrestler then drops <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> or kneeling <b>position</b> dropping the opponent's head into the mat. It is currently used by Jay Briscoe as the Jay-Driller and by Jeremiah Crane as the Cranial Contusion.|$|R
60|$|Ghek {{caused the}} rykor <b>to</b> assume <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> with its {{back against the}} wall where it might remain without {{direction}} from his brain. Then he released his contact with its spinal cord; but remained in position upon its shoulders, waiting and watching, for the kaldane's curiosity was aroused. He had not long to wait before the lights were flashed on and one of the locked doors opened <b>to</b> admit <b>a</b> half-dozen warriors. They approached him rapidly and worked quickly. First they removed all his weapons and then, snapping a fetter about one of the rykor's ankles, secured him to the end of one of the chains hanging from the walls. Next they dragged the long table <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new position and there bolted it to the floor so that an end, instead of the middle, was directly before the prisoner. On the table before him they set food and water and upon {{the opposite end of the}} table they laid the key to the fetter. Then they unlocked and opened all the doors and departed.|$|R
