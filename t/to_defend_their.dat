At the event, AMW retained the championship.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2003 final, Canavan relinquished the {{captaincy}} to Cormac McAnallen, but the 24-year-old died {{shortly after}} {{taking up the}} position. This tragedy adversely affected the mindset of the team, and they were unable <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> All-Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Before their European game, {{the team}} {{travelled}} to Faro <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> lead. They won their fourth consecutive match, with Nuno Gomes scoring his fourth goal in five games. At {{the end of}} September, Benfica travelled to Romania to play Dinamo Bucuresti.

5|$|During World War Two, Destroyers served {{three basic}} functions: first, {{to act as}} {{screening}} ships <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> fleets from enemy fleets, second, to attack the screening ships of enemy fleets, and third, <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> fleet from submarines. How the destroyers were actually used varied upon the country. Germany abandoned the third function almost entirely, which showed in German destroyers' lack of strong anti-submarine armament, preferring to rely upon a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re-fitted as minelayers. The role of the destroyer began to vary much more heavily as WW2 progressed; where the British destroyers were built for escorting fleets, defending them from enemy planes, and sinking submarines, the Germans had destroyers were built to escort fleets, or act as torpedo boats.|$|E
50|$|The club {{came close}} <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>their</b> {{title in the}} Pre-season Cup, topping their group before losing on {{penalties}} in the final to Adelaide United. However, their 2006-07 A-League campaign was disappointing, winning just one of their first seven matches and struggling for consistency, finishing sixth on the table.|$|R

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

50|$|SOG {{significantly}} {{ramped up}} its maritime operation in 1967 though the Forae initiative, which included operation Urgency. During Urgency, a Naval Advisory Detachment acquired additional patrol boats, {{allowing them to}} scan the North Vietnam coast for vulnerable junkets nearly every day.) These activities were also served to inflame paranoia within North Vietnam and force the government to assign additional resources <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>their</b> coasts.|$|R

5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort at Detroit, but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> homes by staying closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in the Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} hundred years the Grimaldi defended their {{territory}} from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence.

5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E
