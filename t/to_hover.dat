5|$|Nectar- and pollen-eating bats {{are able}} <b>to</b> <b>hover,</b> {{in a similar}} way to hummingbirds. The sharp leading edges of the wings can create vortexes which provide lift. The vortex may be {{stabilized}} by the animal changing its wing curvatures.|$|E
5|$|Battling the Flood, Covenant, {{and human}} forces are the Sentinels: robotic drones {{designed}} by an extinct race called the Forerunners {{to protect their}} structures and prevent Flood outbreaks. Sentinels are able <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack durability, but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood.|$|E
5|$|The bat's upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, {{while the}} {{underside}} is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips {{that allow the}} bat <b>to</b> <b>hover.</b> Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, {{although there are no}} tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{guidance}} from the Secretary of the Army, CDC established Qualitative Material Development Objectives (QMDO) for a rotary-wing aircraft with 195-knot (224mph, 361km/h) cruise speed, 220-knot (253mph, 407km/h) dash speed, and the capability <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> out-of-ground-effect (OGE) at 6,000feet (1,830m) on a 95°F (35°C) day. The speed requirements {{were derived from}} the speed of aircraft the helicopter would escort. The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDRE) conditionally approved the changes to the development objectives, pending his review of the proposed program. He also directed the Army {{to determine whether or}} not any other helicopter could offer an improvement in performance over the UH-1B in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E

5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping <b>to</b> <b>hover,</b> and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Needy decides {{she must}} kill Jennifer. She goes to Jennifer's home and sees her, already recovered, picking out her next victims in her yearbook. Crashing {{through the window}} with a box cutter, Needy fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart, {{destroying}} the demon and killing her. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter {{on top of her}} daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. As she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as the ability <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> in the air. Desiring revenge for what was done to her, Jennifer, and Chip, Needy escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; there, she slaughters the members, whose killings are later discovered by local authorities.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the use {{of highly}} non-Keplerian trajectories enabled by solar {{radiation}} pressure and devices with variable area or reflectivity to map and characterize small asteroids. Strategies alternative <b>to</b> <b>hovering</b> involving a combination of retrograde and prograde orbits, together with inversions of the orbit direction by either maneuvers or exploiting the natural dynamics, are presented and analysed. As opposed to terminator orbits, this alternating orbiter strategy allows direct overflies of the subsolar point and other equatorial regions. A simple cost comparison demonstrates a significant improvement with respect <b>to</b> traditional <b>hovering</b> strategies. Additional orbits of interest for hopper spacecraft are also discussed. Finally, various possible implementations of variable-area spacecraft that could provide the required solar radiation pressure control are suggested and discussed...|$|R

5|$|Outside of combat, Scarygirl navigates {{the game}} world by running, jumping, gliding, and using her tentacle arm to grapple onto objects. Scarygirl {{eventually}} gains {{access to a}} feather attachment that can replace the hook on her tentacle arm, allowing Scarygirl <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> and reach otherwise inaccessible locations. Stages contain deadly traps {{that have to be}} avoided, often by grappling over them, and most stages contain at least two paths through the stage, although after choosing one the option to backtrack and take the other route exists. Crystals, which can be used to purchase combat upgrades for both combat and exploration, and heart fragments, which increase Scarygirl's maximum health, are scattered throughout stages. In order to get all of the crystals and heart fragments, players will have to traverse both paths through stages that have more than one path.|$|E
5|$|By 1913, Large Black had by {{then spread}} {{throughout}} most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania. The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because {{of their ability to}} thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> around 1 percent of the total population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first exports to the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985. Today, small herds {{can be found in the}} US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990, and there are also herds in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, the Neon District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E

50|$|An {{edition of}} Popular Science {{magazine}} in 1969 featured a backpack helicopter that used small jet engines in a tip jet configuration instead of contra-rotating rotors. This design could function in autorotation. Related are devices like a backpack helicopter which {{also include a}} seat and leg supports, which are small, open-topped helicopters. In theory, a helicopter would be more efficient than a rocket-powered jetpack, possessing a greater specific impulse, and being more suited <b>to</b> <b>hovering,</b> due <b>to</b> the lower velocities of the propelled gases.|$|R

25|$|The K-MAX {{relies on}} two primary {{advantages}} of synchropters over conventional helicopters: The increased efficiency compared to conventional rotor-lift technology; and the synchropter's natural tendency <b>to</b> <b>hover.</b> This increases stability, especially for precision work in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter is {{more responsive to}} pilot control inputs, {{making it possible to}} easily swing a load, or to scatter seed, chemicals, or water over a larger area.|$|E

25|$|Helicopters {{have taken}} a primary role in air-sea rescue since their {{introduction}} in the 1940s. Helicopters can fly in rougher weather than fixed-wing aircraft, and they can deliver injured passengers directly to hospitals or other emergency facilities. A practical amphibious helicopter first appeared in 1941 and the water-landing feature soon proved its worth. Non-amphibious helicopters were required <b>to</b> <b>hover</b> above {{the scene of a}} water accident and utilize a hoist but amphibious helicopters were capable of setting down on the water to effect a rescue more directly.|$|E
40|$|An {{autopilot}} {{logic is}} designed here for controlling a helicopter with a hanging load. A 16 th order {{model for the}} system is decoupled into four subsystems: (1) a second order system for yawing motion, (2) a second order system for vertical motion, (3) a sixth order system for longitudinal motion, and (4) a sixth order system for lateral motion. A measuring scheme, {{which could be used}} in remote areas, is developed and filters are designed to estimate the state variables from these measurements. The autopilot can be used to move the load over short distances without retracting the cables. This is done by automatically shifting the autopilot modes from position-hold (<b>hover)</b> <b>to</b> acceleration-hold to velocity-hold (cruise) to deceleration-hold <b>to</b> velocity-hold (near <b>hover)</b> <b>to</b> position-hold (<b>hover).</b> Use of such an autopilot might save considerable turnaround time. The Sikorsky S- 61 helicopter is chosen as an example vehicle. The performance of the controlled system is studied in the presence of longitudinal and lateral winds...|$|R
