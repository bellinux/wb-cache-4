5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>and</b> keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} {{politics}} over economics. <b>The</b> <b>making</b> <b>and</b> implementation of {{policy is not}} one of discovery, but rather of top down implementation.

25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>and</b> breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the chance that they make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the presynaptic cell is increased. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, {{the family}} moved to Toronto, where Layton {{graduated}} the following year from York University with a Master of Arts in political science; and later in 1983, he completed his Doctor of Philosophy in political science at York. In 1974, Layton became a professor at Ryerson Polytechincal Institute (now Ryerson University). Over the next decade, he taught at Ryerson, York, and University of Toronto. He also became a prominent activist for a variety of causes.

25|$|Card accredits {{two books}} in {{particular}} as being profoundly {{influential in the}} writing of this novel: Thailand: A Short History by David K. Wyatt and Raj: <b>The</b> <b>Making</b> <b>and</b> Unmaking of British India by Lawrence James. In addition to these two books he was also inspired by Phillip Absher, {{who was one of the}} readers of the first draft. Phillip suggested that the Petra arc of the novel was anti-climactic. Upon hearing this criticism, Card rethought this entire book and decided to split it into two books. At the time of publication, Card thought the Bean series (Shadow series) of the Enderverse would only be four books long.|$|E

25|$|While Pedro Linares {{dreamed of}} the creatures, {{they did not}} surface in a vacuum. Similarities and {{parallels}} can be drawn between alebrijes and various supernatural creatures from Mexico’s indigenous and European past. In pre-Hispanic art, the brightly-colored images were often fantastic and macabre. Influences from Mexico City’s Chinatown, especially in the dragons, and Gothic art such as gargoyles can be seen. Red cardboard demons called judas, which Linares made, are still made to be burned in Mexico during Holy Week in purification rituals. More recent predecessors in Mexican culture, artists Julio Ruelas and graphics artist/commentator José Guadalupe Posada, created fantastic and sometimes terrifying images. Alebrijes, especially the monsters, have gained a reputation for “scaring away bad spirits” and protecting the home. Some, like master craftsman Christian David Mendez, claim {{that there is a}} certain mysticism involved in <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>and</b> owning of alebrijes, with parts of certain animals representing human characteristics.|$|E
