5|$|The bobcat is an {{adaptable}} animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>forest.</b> It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E

2500|$|Tampus, {{the center}} of the newly formed town was located at the end of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>forest</b> in {{contrast}} with one of the sitios which was called [...] "Pintong gubat" [...] or gate of the forest. Sometimes, the name of a barrio is taken from its location, {{as in the case of}} Barrio Burol which suggests the high location of the barrio.

The word [...] "salawag" [...] refers to long bamboo poles to which nipa roofing are tied up.

2500|$|The former {{rich man}} {{found it hard}} having so many mouths to feed. So he made a plan to abandon his daughters in the forest. He hid this plan from his wife but his {{youngest}} daughter named Phao heard about it. When their father left them alone in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>forest,</b> the twelve girls {{were able to find}} their way back home thanks to their younger sister who had left marks in the path. But their father tried again and this time they were not able to find their way back home. They spent days walking deeper and deeper into the forest and became very hungry. Their father had given them twelve packets of rice, but when they opened them they found out that eleven of them were filled with sand and only one had rice in it. They shared that little rice and ate it crying, lamenting their misfortune. Wandering aimlessly the twelve girls came to a lake, where they tried to catch fish to satiate their hunger. Each of the sisters succeeded in catching a fish and eleven of them playfully poked the eyes of their fish with sharp twigs, except for the youngest one who poked only one eye.|$|E

6000|$|By and by {{she fell}} asleep, only to dream that the package was a caressing hand {{stealing}} about her, feeling for hers, and holding it with soft, strong clasp. When she awoke {{she had the}} strangest sensation in her right palm. It was moist, throbbing, hot, and the feel of it on her cheek was strangely thrilling and comforting. She lay awake then. The night was dark and still. Only a low moan of wind in the pines and the faint tinkle of a sheep bell broke the serenity. She felt very small and lonely lying there in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>forest,</b> and, try how she would, {{it was impossible to}} think the same then as she did in the clear light of day. Resentment, pride, anger--these seemed abated now. If {{the events of the day}} had not changed her, they had at least brought up softer and kinder memories and emotions than she had known for long. Nothing hurt and saddened her so much as to remember the gay, happy days of her childhood, her sweet mother, her, old home. Then her thought returned to Isbel and his gift. It had been years since anyone had made her a gift. What could this one be? It did not matter. The wonder was that Jean Isbel should bring it to her and that she could be perturbed by its presence. [...] "He meant it for his sister and so he thought well of me," [...] she said, in finality.|$|E
60|$|Miss Roxy laid {{aside the}} straw bonnet {{which she was}} ripping, and motioned Mara into the outer room,--the sink-room, as the sisters called it. It was the scullery of their little establishment,--the place where all dish-washing and clothes-washing was {{generally}} performed,--but the boards of the floor were white as snow, and the place had the odor of neatness. The open door looked out pleasantly into <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>forest,</b> where {{the waters of the}} cove, now at high tide, could be seen glittering through the trees. Soft moving spots of sunlight fell, checkering the feathery ferns and small piney tribes of evergreen which ran in ruffling wreaths of green through the dry, brown matting of fallen pine needles. Birds were singing and calling to each other merrily from the green shadows of the forest,--everything had a sylvan fullness and freshness of life. There are moods of mind when the sight of the bloom and freshness of nature affects us painfully, like the want of sympathy in a dear friend. Mara had been all her days a child of the woods; her delicate life had grown up in them like one of their own cool shaded flowers; and there was not a moss, not a fern, not an upspringing thing that waved a leaf or threw forth a flower-bell, that was not a well-known friend to her; she had watched for years its haunts, known the time of its coming and its going, studied its shy and veiled habits, and interwoven with its life each year a portion of her own; and now she looked out into the old mossy woods, with their wavering spots of sun and shadow, with a yearning pain, as if she wanted help or sympathy to come from their silent recesses.|$|E

60|$|The {{furniture}} of this room, {{though of}} the barest and most frigid simplicity, is yet relieved {{by many of}} those touches of taste and fancy which the indwelling of a person of sensibility and imagination will shed off upon the physical surroundings. The bed was draped with a white spread, embroidered {{with a kind of}} knotted tracery, the working of which was considered among the female accomplishments of those days, and over the head of it was a painting of a bunch of crimson and white trillium, executed with a fidelity to Nature that showed the most delicate gifts of observation. Over the mantelpiece hung a painting of the Bay of Genoa, which had accidentally found a voyage home in Zephaniah Pennel's sea-chest, and which skillful fingers had surrounded with a frame curiously wrought of moss and sea-shells. Two vases of India china stood on the mantel, filled with spring flowers, crowfoot, anemones, and liverwort, with drooping bells of the twin-flower. The looking-glass that hung over the table {{in one corner of the}} room was fancifully webbed with long, drooping festoons of that gray moss which hangs in such graceful wreaths from the boughs of the pines in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>forest</b> shadows of Orr's Island. On the table below was a collection of books: a whole set of Shakespeare which Zephaniah Pennel had bought of a Portland bookseller; a selection, in prose and verse, from the best classic writers, presented to Mara Lincoln, the fly-leaf said, by her sincere friend, Theophilus Sewell; a Virgil, much thumbed, with an old, worn cover, which, however, some adroit fingers had concealed under a coating of delicately marbled paper;--there was a Latin dictionary, a set of Plutarch's Lives, the Mysteries of Udolpho, and Sir Charles Grandison, together with Edwards on the Affections, and Boston's Fourfold State;--there was an inkstand, curiously contrived from a sea-shell, with pens and paper in that phase of arrangement which betokened frequency of use; and, lastly, a little work-basket, containing a long strip of curious and delicate embroidery, in which the needle yet hanging showed that the work was in progress.|$|E
