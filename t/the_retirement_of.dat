5000|$|The {{concept was}} created and {{executed}} by Dr. David Bronner, CEO <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Retirement</b> Systems <b>of</b> Alabama. <b>The</b> {{mission was to}} effectively diversify {{the assets of the}} state's pension fund and economically help the state of Alabama, the philosophy being that [...] "the stronger <b>the</b> <b>Retirement</b> Systems <b>of</b> Alabama can make Alabama, <b>the</b> stronger <b>the</b> <b>Retirement</b> Systems will be." ...|$|R
30|$|According to the “labor law of People’s Republic of China”, {{the legal}} minimum {{employment}} age is 16. The employment rate of urban population {{at the age}} from 16 to 20 is not high (about 10 %). Most urban workers are university graduates, and their employment age is about 22  years old. Therefore, we assume the age that employees initially attend insurance is 22. According to the data of the sixth census in 2010, population over 100 is combined into that {{at the age of}} 100, which means that the default maximum survival age in the census is at 100. Since population forecasting is based on census, this paper also considers 100 as maximum. “The Recommendations for the 13 th Five-Year Plan” points out the policy <b>of</b> progressive delaying <b>retirement</b> age, which shows <b>the</b> trend <b>of</b> <b>retirement</b> age delaying. Since the specific plan has not been announced, this paper assumes to set the scheme according to developed countries: China begins to delay <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age since <b>the</b> year of 2022. First, delaying <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age <b>of</b> female workers with 6  months every year, and <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age <b>of</b> female workers will reach 55 in 2031. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age <b>of</b> female cadres and female workers begins to be delayed in 2032 with 6  months every year, and <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age <b>of</b> female reaches 60 in 2041. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age <b>of</b> both female and male begins to be delayed at 2042 with 6  months every year, and <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age <b>of</b> both female and male reaches 65 in 2051. Taking <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>retirement</b> age program and <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> early <b>retirement</b> behavior into consideration, sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> age would be analyzed.|$|R
