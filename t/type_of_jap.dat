40|$|AbstractNon-starch polysaccharides (NSP) {{constitute}} {{the main part}} of dietary fiber (DF). There are two kinds of NSP - insoluble and soluble. Most plant foods contain both types although proportions vary. A good source of NSP/fiber is Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), vegetable - rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals. Jerusalem artichoke (JA) is used for managing cholesterol, lipids in the blood, can also help with weight control, not through better metabolism of fats but through better management of sugars. The addition of Jerusalem artichoke powder (JAP) increases the fiber content of the pastry products, making it a healthier food. Several methods are available for the determination of total dietary fiber in products. The Uppsala method is the most appropriate when information of the DF components is required. Since different DF components have a range of beneficial effects on human health this approach of analyzing DF should become more widely used when characterizing foods. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine quantity changes in individual NSP of DF in raw material JAP and such pastry products as cakes, butter biscuits and honey biscuits where JAP was added. The study identified quantity and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> NSP in <b>JAP</b> and pastry products with JAP in concentration 30 % and 50 % of total amount of flour, but as control are samples without JAP. Results showed that the major NSP monomers of all pastry kinds are, in decreasing manner, glucose, galactose, mannose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, and fucose. Additionally, NSP content increases substantially with increasing concentration <b>of</b> <b>JAP</b> in cakes, honey biscuits and butter biscuits...|$|R
