5|$|After van der Linden's {{death in}} 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow {{a total of}} 1,000gulden to acquire the Zending Press; the funds were, in part, {{borrowed}} from his friends. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted {{most of his time}} to the publishing house, and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier writings. The publishing house was, however, unable <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b> That year he published a new syair, consisting of 24quartets, entitled Orang Prampoewan. He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including Bintang Betawi and Domingoe.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other forecourts had {{introduced}} 'minimum spend' rules of £35, {{to try and}} prevent motorists who have a half-full tank from filling up again, as well as <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>an</b> extra <b>profit</b> in <b>a</b> time of crisis.|$|R

50|$|Between <b>a</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>profit</b> and {{the need}} to start paying off the debt {{incurred}} from acquiring Pacific Lumber, Hurwitz's Maxxam replaced the sustainable growth policy of the previous owner-managers (primarily the Murphy family) with one of clearcutting.|$|R
5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Si Tjonat was {{released}} in 1929. Although a work of fiction, it was advertised as {{based on a true}} story; this had been common in works of Malay literature {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, including Tjerita Si Tjonat. The film was one in a line of domestic production targeted primarily at ethnic Chinese audiences, following Lily van Java and Setangan Berloemoer Darah (both 1928); film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this was evident from the predominantly Chinese production team and cast. Native audiences also enjoyed the film, particularly its action sequences. Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that it was of distinctly commercial orientation, meant only <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit,</b> and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 Hancock and {{his partner}} Peter Wright {{commenced}} publication in Perth of a weekly newspaper, The Sunday Independent, principally to help further their mining interests. Faced with strong competition, the newspaper is thought never <b>to</b> have <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit,</b> Hancock largely relinquishing his interest in it in the early 70s and Wright selling it to The Truth in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Mini-tenders {{often provide}} {{a market for}} investors to sell {{illiquid}} securities. Some have argued that this assertion is invalid because the bidder would have more difficulty selling the shares than individual investors, since they have a larger block of accumulated shares. While this is true if bidders are attempting <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>profit,</b> many bidders' strategies are to buy and hold the securities for the long-term.|$|R
50|$|Rumors abound {{that the}} crew of UCS Blackstar have {{discovered}} a novel alien presence on a nearby colony. Seeing <b>an</b> opportunity <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>profit,</b> countless privateers (human & mode) leap into action to carve out their fate among {{the stars in the}} hope of making their fortunes and fame, perhaps at the expense of their lives against swarms of aliens, hostile environments and each other.|$|R
5|$|It {{had taken}} {{a decade and a}} half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b> Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 177 - 190) As Latinos are {{the largest}} and fastest growing minority in the Unites States, {{it is critical to}} address how the often rocky relationship between the U. S. and Mexico continues to be played out through images of Latinas and Latinos in film. By performing a textual analysis of the 2002 Julie Taymor film Frida, I seek to understand the complex ways in which the images presented in the media reflect, construct and contest normalized constructions of gender, race and U. S. -Mexico relations. The film, Frida, was celebrated as a cultural triumph {{at the time of its}} release and was considered a financial success, having recouped the cost of both production and promotion in addition <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b> Using <b>a</b> feminist and cultural studies approach, I analyze the transformation of Frida Kahlo from socialist, gender defying, poly-amorous artist to icon of Mexican culture on the big screen...|$|R
5000|$|... "At a {{time when}} the {{democracy}} activists on the island are facing even harsher reprisals from the brutal Cuban regime, it's pathetic that a Cuban-American tycoon feels inspired to trample on the backs of those activists in order to give the communist thugs more money with which to repress. The only little old thing that is standing in Alfy's way of realizing these sleazy business deals with the devil is US law. He doesn't talk about the arbitrary arrests of pro-freedom leaders in Cuba or the continual beatings endured by the peaceful Damas de Blanco. Oh no, for Alfy, the only hindrance <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> off the suffering of the Cuban people is pesky US laws and he is working with groups to undo those laws. It is sickening to read that he brings up the separation of the Cuban family when he is doing all he can to exacerbate that problem. Shame on him..." ...|$|R
500|$|In the 1927–28 season, the Senators {{played two}} [...] "home" [...] games in Detroit, {{collecting}} {{the bulk of}} the gate receipts (thus allowing them <b>to</b> actually <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> for that season), while Jack Adams retired to become the coach and general manager of the Detroit Cougars. [...] The brightest note from the campaign was goaltender Alex Connell's play, in which he set a NHL record (unsurpassed as of 2015) of six consecutive shutouts, a shutout run of 460 minutes and 49 seconds.|$|R

25|$|The CCF set up eleven small Crown {{corporations}} including {{power and}} telephone utilities, bus and airline companies, and ventures into sodium sulfate mining, a woolen mill, and a shoe factory.

25|$|The Company began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> after 1612, when {{planting}} {{a couple of}} new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to English tastes than the native tobacco. Tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony, and settlers were urged to cultivate more. The colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high.|$|E
25|$|In September 1973, Time-Life, Inc. {{completed}} its {{acquisition of the}} pay service. At the time, Home Box Office's future looked dim: it only had 8,000 subscribers across 14 cable systems, {{all of which were}} located in Pennsylvania, and it was suffering from a significant subscriber churn rate. HBO would eventually increase its fortunes within two years: by April 1975, the service had around 100,000 subscribers in Pennsylvania and New York state, and had begun <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> limited <b>profit.</b>|$|R

50|$|On October 22, 1992, Darrell Zimmerman of Chicago, Illinois and Anthony Catalfo of Bayside, Queens, New York, {{attempted}} {{to manipulate the}} US Treasury bond futures and options market of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The gist of the scam was to depress prices long enough for Zimmerman and Catalfo <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> sizable <b>profit.</b> Catalfo reportedly profited approximately $1,500,000 but Zimmerman lost nearly $9,000,000, for which his clearing firm, Lee B.

25|$|With the American Line {{struggling}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> in {{the wake}} of the 1873 financial panic, the company decided to experiment with some novel exports.

25|$|Owner Calvin Griffith faced {{financial}} {{difficulty with}} the start of free agency. While other owners had fortunes made in other businesses, Griffith's only income came from baseball. He ran the Twins as a family-owned business, employing many family members, and had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> each season. Stars Lyman Bostock and Larry Hisle left as free agents after the 1977 season and prompted the trade of Rod Carew after the 1978 season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of robotics to {{the manufacturing process}} effectively transformed the automotive industry, with Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company soon following General Motors' lead and installing Unimates in their manufacturing facilities. The rapid adoption of the technology also provided Unimation with a working business model: after selling the first Unimate at a $35,000 loss, as demand increased, the company was able to begin building the robotic arms for significantly less and thus began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> substantial <b>profit.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003 {{the company}} ceased {{production}} in the UK, outsourcing its operations to India and Portugal. The cost-cutting move came amid a £600,000 annual loss, which the company reversed the following year <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> £1.5 million <b>profit.</b> Sales further increased by 20% to 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{first year}} of {{operation}} of the railroad coincided with {{the beginnings of a}} deep national economic decline. Farmers were unable to get profitable return on their crops, banks and railroads failed nationwide. The SJVRR was unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay its debt, was leased to the Southern Pacific Railroad and subsequently bought by SPRR in 1893. By reducing the railroad's schedule of operation and trimming costs, the Southern Pacific was able <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> small <b>profit</b> in the first years after its acquisition.|$|R
25|$|The Warner Brothers Company {{changed its}} name to Warnaco, Inc. in 1968, and {{continued}} to grow its business exponentially through various mergers and acquisitions throughout the 1970s. By the middle of the decade, Warnaco had become a multi-national clothing conglomerate with almost 20 divisions. Despite the company’s diverse portfolio, however, Warnaco was struggling <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b> Recognizing the potential failure, Field handed management of the company over to James Walker and Philip Lamoureux. Walker was named CEO in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In Maryland, Baltimore {{sought to}} create a haven for English Catholics and to {{demonstrate}} that Catholics and Protestants could live together peacefully, even issuing the Act Concerning Religion in matters of religion. Cecil Calvert was himself a convert to Catholicism, a considerable political setback for a nobleman in 17th century England, where Roman Catholics could easily be considered enemies of the crown and potential traitors to their country. Like other aristocratic proprietors, he also hoped <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> on the new colony.|$|E
25|$|The Garden City estate began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> in the 1970s, {{leading to}} {{investment}} {{in a number of}} town amenities: a working farm, Standalone Farm, in 1980, a leisure centre and a theatre named Plinston Hall in 1982, a free hospital (the Ernest Gardiner Day Hospital) in 1984, and major refurbishment of the town's cinema and shopping centre in 1996 and 1997.

From 1986 to 1989, he was Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and then Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion until 1990. In addition, in 1987 Mulroney gave Andre responsibility for Canada Post Corporation.

50|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, The General, an action-adventure-comedy made {{toward the end of the}} silent era, was not well {{received}} by critics and audiences, resulting in mediocre box office returns (about half a million dollars domestically, and approximately one million worldwide). Because of its then-huge budget ($750,000 supplied by Metro chief Joseph Schenck) and failure <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> significant <b>profit,</b> Keaton lost his independence as a filmmaker and was forced into a restrictive deal with MGM. In 1954 the film entered the public domain (in the USA), owing to the claimant's failure to renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.|$|R
