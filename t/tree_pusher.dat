40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study has been to build general models of the mechanics in tree felling with chain-saw and to compare felling torque for different tools. The theoretical models are completed and validated with a comparative study. The study includes {{a great number of}} felling tools of which some are used with different methods. Felling torque was measured using a naturally like measuring arrangement where a tree is cut at about 3. 7 m height and then anchored with a dynamometer to a tree opposite to the felling direction. Notch and felling cut was made as ordinary with exception that the hinge was made extra thin to reduce bending resistance. The tree was consequently not felled during the trials and several combinations of felling tools and individuals could be used on the same tree. The results show big differences between tools, methods and persons. The differences were, however, not general, but could vary depending on conditions (first of all tree diameters). Tools and methods that push or pull on the stem are little affected {{by the size of the}} tree, while tools that press on the stump are very much dependent of a large stump-diameter. Hand force asserted on a simple pole is consequently a powerful tool on small trees. For trees of medium size there are several alternative methods with different sizes and brands of felling levers and wedges. Larger and more ungainly tools and methods like <b>tree</b> <b>pusher,</b> winch, etc. develop very high felling torque on all tree sizes. On large trees also the felling wedge and especially the use of several wedges together develop very high felling torque...|$|E

40|$|Best Paper Award in the GP track - see [URL] audienceSemantic Backpropagation (SB) was {{introduced}} in GP so as {{to take into account}} the semantics of a GP tree at all intermediate states of the program execution, i. e., at each node of the tree. The idea is to compute the optimal " should-be " values each subtree should return, whilst assuming that the rest of the tree is unchanged, so as to minimize the fitness of the tree. To this end, the Random Desired Output (RDO) mutation operator, proposed in [17], uses SB in choosing, from a given library, a tree whose semantics are preferred to the semantics of a randomly selected subtree from the parent <b>tree.</b> <b>Pushing</b> this idea one step further, this paper introduces the Local Tree Improvement (LTI) operator, which selects from the parent tree the overall best subtree for applying RDO, using a small randomly drawn static library. Used within a simple Iterated Local Search framework, LTI can find the exact solution of many popular Boolean benchmarks in reasonable time whilst keeping solution trees small, thus paving the road for truly memetic GP algorithms...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the distribution of lateral root strength is related to the shape of the system and the forces withstood, wood samples were taken from roots of various mature tree species and the strength tested. Root strength decreased along the root at different rates, {{depending on the type of}} root system present. Slightly tapered lateral roots in plate root systems were relatively stronger further away from the stem than the highly tapered laterals in heart and tap root systems. Wood strength in Norway spruce (plate system) was found to increase along the lateral roots before decreasing again. The increase in strength may coincide with the point of maximum bending of the root as the tree sways backwards and forwards in the wind. Strength was also found to increase on the underside of lateral roots in the plate systems of poplar. The undersides of these roots will experience high compressive stresses due to the weight of the <b>tree</b> <b>pushing</b> the root on to the hard bearing surface of the soil. External loading forces in plate root systems will be transmitted into the soil further away from the stem due to the lack of branches, therefore a high strength along the root will help resist mechanical stress.
