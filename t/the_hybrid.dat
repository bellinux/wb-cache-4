5|$|Edgar T.

Herb Wagner, in 1953, suggested instead that it was <b>the</b> <b>hybrid</b> of A.montanum and A.platyneuron, noting that Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along those lines. His cytological studies the following year showed that A.bradleyi was an allotetraploid, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and A.platyneuron to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E
