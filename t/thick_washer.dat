5000|$|SAR 48 - IMBEL {{produced}} a semi-automatic {{version of the}} FAL for Springfield Armory, Inc. (not {{to be confused with}} the US military Springfield Armory), which was marketed in the US as the SAR-48 and SAR-4800, starting in the mid-1980s. IMBEL-made receivers have been much in demand among American gunsmiths building FALs from [...] "parts kits," [...] especially the forged type 3 without lightening cuts, the strongest of any FN-licensed receiver Early SAR-48s were simply selective-fire M964 FALs which were modified to semi-auto-only by replacing the safety sear with a <b>thick</b> <b>washer</b> soldered in its place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The drop-hammer {{compression}} {{testing method}} where the stroke is calculated by solving {{the equation of}} motions of the drop-hammer and anvil was improved {{in order to determine}} the strain-rate dependence of the elastic modulus of rubber material. An additional tool for interrupting the compression was embedded in the apparatus. The tool was a <b>thick</b> <b>washer</b> which informed the time when the prescribed compressive strain was achieved by the sharp increase of compression force. The oscillatory stress-time curve obtained by the load cell was appropriately smoothed employing the method of moving average. The effect of the friction at the interface between the rubber specimen and the tools was properly eliminated by the extrapolating method using the specimens with several variations in heights. The stress-strain relationship was obtained under the dynamic condition. The numerical simulation of impact compression disclosed that the effect of inertia on the deformation pattern was practically small under the experimental condition adopted. Conducting the low-speed compression tests, the dependence in elastic modulus of rubber material on the strain-rate was appropriately determined...|$|E
5000|$|So called 'brushless synchros' use rotary {{transformers}} (that have no magnetic {{interaction with}} the usual rotor and stator) to feed power to the rotor. These transformers have stationary primaries, and rotating secondaries. The secondary is somewhat like a spool wound with magnet wire, the axis of the spool concentric with the rotor's axis. The [...] "spool" [...] is the secondary winding's core, its flanges are the poles, and its coupling does not vary significantly with rotor position. The primary winding is similar, surrounded by its magnetic core, and its end pieces are like <b>thick</b> <b>washers.</b> The holes in those end pieces align with the rotating secondary poles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} {{restoration}} depth on {{the curing time}} of a conventional and two bulk-fill composite resins by measuring microhardness and the respective radiosity of the bottom surface of the specimen was investigated. 1 -, 3 - and 5 -mm <b>thick</b> <b>washers</b> were filled with Surefil SDR Flow–U (SDR), Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill-IVA (TEC) or Esthet-X HD–B 1 (EHD), and cured with Bluephase® G 2 for 40 s. Additional 1 -mm washers were filled with SDR, TEC or EHD, placed above the light sensor of MARC®, stacked with pre-cured 1 -, 3 - or 5 -mm washer of respective material, and cured for 2. 5 ~ 60 s to mimic 2 -, 4 - and 6 -mm thick composite curing. The sensor measured the radiosity (EB) {{at the bottom of}} specimen stacks. Vickers hardness (VH) was measured immediately at 5 locations with triplicate specimens. Nonlinear regression of VH vs EB by VH=α[1 -exp(-EB/β) ] with all thickness shows that the values of α, maximum hardness, are 21. 6 ± 1. 0 kg/mm 2 for SDR, 38. 3 ± 0. 6 kg/mm 2 for TEC and 45. 3 ± 2. 6 kg/mm 2 for EHD, and the values of β, rate parameter, are 0. 40 ± 0. 06 J/cm 2 for SDR, 0. 77 ± 0. 04 J/cm 2 for TEC and 0. 58 ± 0. 09 J/cm 2 for EHD. The radiosity of the bottom surface was calculated when the bottom surface of each material attained 80 % of α of each material. The curing times for each material are in agreement with manufacturer recommendation for thickness. It is possible to estimate time needed to cure composite resin of known depth adequately by the radiosity and microhardness of the bottom surface...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} high critical temperature {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (high-Tc SQUID) magnetometers based on bicrystal grain boundary and nanowire junctions for the potential use in on-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG), which is a new generation MEG technique with reduced sensor-to-subject standoff distances. MEG is a method of mapping neural dynamics in the human brain by recording the magnetic fields produced by neural currents. Its passive and non-contact nature allows doctors and neuroscientists to safely and effectively carry out clinical diagnoses and scientific research on the human brain. State-of-the-art MEG systems utilize low-Tc SQUID sensors with sensitivities of 1 [...] 5 fT/√Hz down to 1 Hz to measure the extremely tiny biomagnetic fields (~ 100 fT) from the brain. However, low-Tc SQUIDs require liquid helium cooling to reach their operating temperature (< 10 K). The complicated cryogenics limit the sensor-to-subject distance to 20 mm at best. On-scalp MEG, where sensors are placed with close proximity (few millimeters) to the scalp of the subject, can be realized with the aid of helium-free MEG sensor technologies. In this thesis, we designed, fabricated and characterized high-Tc SQUID magnetometers made from YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (YBCO) that can operate with liquid nitrogen cooling (77 K) based on bicrystal grain boundary or nanowire junctions. Single-layer bicrystal devices with a directly connected pickup loop were demonstrated to have a magnetic flux noise of 5 µΦ 0 /√Hz with an effective area of 0. 24 mm 2, giving a magnetic field sensitivity of 40 fT/√Hz at 77 K. For nanowire-based devices, a two-level coupling approach was implemented, where the flip-chip SQUID is connected to a washer-type pickup loop with the inner hole size matching that of a flux transformer input coil. This improved the effective area of nanowire-based SQUID magnetometers to 0. 46 mm 2. Combining with the magnetic flux noise of 55 µΦ 0 /√Hz for this type of devices, the best magnetic field sensitivity obtained was 240 fT/√Hz at 77 K. A simulation method was developed and demonstrated to give an accurate evaluation of the effective area and inductances in the design of SQUID magnetometers. Using this method, nanowire-based SQUID magnetometers with <b>thick</b> <b>washers</b> were predicted to give an improved effective area of 2. 2 mm 2. A single-channel high-Tc MEG system housing the 40 fT/√Hz bicrystal grain boundary SQUID magnetometer was used to benchmark against low-Tc SQUIDs in a state-of-the-art MEG system (Elekta Neuromag® TRIUX, courtesy of NatMEG) based on recordings on a head phantom. It was shown that the expected amplitude gain of magnetic field signals associated with the on-scalp sensors (reduced standoff distances to ~ 3 mm) can be obtained while the single-channel signal-to-noise ratio was still lower than its low-Tc counterpart. Also a systematic benchmarking procedure that is objective, fast, and feasible for application to various on-scalp MEG sensing technologies was established. The functionality of this procedure was proved with MEG recordings of auditory and somatosensory evoked fields (AEFs and SEFs, respectively) on one human subject...|$|R
30|$|All {{subjects}} in this study were treated with KA TKA. The following sequence of surgical steps, caliper measurements and adjustments were used to achieve quality assurance in kinematically aligning the femoral and tibial components coincident to the native joint lines (Howell et al. 2017; Howell et al. 2013 b). Step 1 : Identify the distal femoral condyles with cartilage wear. Step 2 : Remove partial cartilage wear to bone. Step 3 : Apply a distal femoral referencing guide that compensates 2  mm thickness when cartilage is worn on the distal medial femoral condyle in the varus knee, and 2  mm thickness when cartilage is worn on the distal lateral femoral condyle in the valgus knee. Step 4 : Measure the thicknesses of the distal femoral resections with a caliper. Step 5 : Adjust the thickness of each resection to match the thickness of the condyles of the femoral component after compensating for cartilage wear and kerf to within[*]±[*] 0.5  mm. When the distal resection is 1 – 2  mm too thin, angle the blade in the saw slot and recut the bone using the ~ 1  mm thickness of the sawblade as a gauge. When the distal resection is 1 – 2  mm too thick, apply a 1 or 2  mm <b>thick</b> <b>washer</b> on the peg of the 4 -in- 1 chamfer block, which shims a corrective gap between the condyle of the femoral component and the distal femur. Step 6 : Position the 4 -in- 1 chamfer block by drilling holes through a posterior femoral referencing guide set at 0 ° rotation. Step 7 : Measure the thicknesses of the posterior femoral resections with a caliper before making the anterior and chamfer cuts. Step 8 : Adjust the thickness of each resection to match the thickness of the condyles of the femoral component after compensating for cartilage wear and kerf to within[*]±[*] 0.5  mm. When a posterior femoral resection is 1 – 2  mm too thick or too thin, eccentrically elongate the pin hole {{in the direction of the}} correction and translate the 4 -in- 1 chamfer block as needed. Step 9 : Secure the chamfer block in the corrected position with compression screws. Step 10 : Make the anterior resections and chamfer femoral resections. These caliper measurements and adjustments are quality assurance steps that align the femoral component coincident to the native distal and posterior femoral joint lines. Step 11 : Remove medial and lateral osteophytes. Step 12 : Apply a conventional extramedullary tibial resection guide to the ankle and place an angel wing in the saw slot of the guide. Step 13 : Adjust the varus-valgus angle of the tibial resection guide until the saw slot parallels the proximal tibial articular surface and the angel wing parallels the slope of the medial tibia after compensating for wear. Step 14 : Resect the proximal tibia. Step 15 : Measure the thickness of the medial and lateral tibial condyles at the base of the tibial spines. When one tibial condyle is thinner than the other by 1  mm or more, expect tightness in that compartment and slackness in the other when assessing varus-valgus laxity with trial components with the knee in full extension. Step 16 : When asymmetric laxity is observed, use a 2 ° varus or valgus recut guide to fine-tune the tibial resection until the laxity is 1 ° or less in full extension like the native knee (Roth et al. 2015). These caliper measurements and adjustments are quality assurance steps that the tibial component is coincident to the native proximal tibial joint line and co-aligns the components to the three rotational axes of the native knee (Howell et al. 2017; Howell et al. 2013 b).|$|E
