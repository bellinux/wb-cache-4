And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{forensic}} entomology became {{well known}} through {{the trial of}} David Westerfield in 2002 for the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam. In this San Diego case, the courtroom became a battle over conflicting reports from four forensic entomologists: David Faulkner, Neal Haskell, M. Lee Goff, and Robert D. Hall. A fifth scientist, William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist, also testified on this issue. Danielle had vanished from her bedroom the night of February 1–2; her partially decomposed body was found February 27. Haskell, Hall, and Faulker argued that forensic entomology established that the body of was dumped in mid-February, during which time Westerfield was already under police surveillance (since February 5), while Goff said the victim's body was colonized by larvae earlier than the other three entomologists estimated (his dates were February 9 to 14). His dates were earlier as he used new data from Canada which gives a significantly slower development for that fly species. Richard Merritt, a forensic entomologist and professor at Michigan State University, stated that because each scientist has his own method, {{this can lead to}} disagreement, {{but a lot of the}} disagreements involve a variation of one or two days, not over a week and a half as in the Westerfield case: “If it's <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> time, someone screwed up”.|$|E

[...] Depp received an MTV Movie Award and a Teen Choice Award for Dead Man's Chest, and was nominated for an Empire Award and another Golden Globe. For his performance in At World's End, Depp won an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance, as well as a People's Choice Award, a Kids' Choice Award, and another Teen Choice Award. He has signed on to reprise the role for future sequels.|$|E

500|$|This {{approach}} to advertising {{was driven by}} Sinclair's reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it {{had the advantage of}} ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by [...] "getting the story across", as Clive Sinclair put it: [...] "Not <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops." ...|$|E

Though two turned her down, one agent, Jean Naggar, encouraged Koen to continue finishing the book, believing {{it to be}} [...] "the launching of a major author." [...] Naggar mailed the manuscript to five major publishing companies, with Random House purchasing it for a [...] "whopping" [...] $350,000 in August 1985, which {{was at the time}} a record for a new novelist. Random House's publisher, Howard Kaminsky, wanted to publish [...] "Oprah Winfrey-type books" [...] in the [...] "how-to-be-the-best-you-can-be" [...] genre. He reasoned, [...] "I'm sure that's up there with the highest prices ever paid for the hardcover rights alone to a first novel. But then it is not <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> price when you consider that it's such a deserving novel – and it will undoubtedly go for a very large amount in paperback later." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album three stars and states: [...] "The music on this CD reissue {{is better than}} it should be. Cannonball Adderley had a fluke hit with [...] "African Waltz" [...] so a full album was {{recorded}} {{with the hope of}} coming up with additional hits... There is some strong material on the set (including [...] "West Coast Blues," [...] "Stockholm Sweetnin'" [...] and a remake of [...] "This Here") but the results are not too substantial and this was not <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> seller; it is still a reasonably enjoyable effort". The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album three stars stating [...] "'A departure from and an extension of what the Adderleys were doing in their small groups. Ernie Wilkins arranges a set of full-bodied top-heavy charts which Adderley has to jostle with to create their own space, and the music's worth hearing for its Sheer Brashness and impact".|$|E

Despite Ventura's concerns about his English, he also initially approved Friedkin's proposal. However, after McQueen backed out, Ventura was hesitant to take part in the movie. Mastroianni was still interested but had problems related to his daughter's custody after his separation from Catherine Deneuve, which eventually made him decline the director's offer. After the disagreement with McQueen, Friedkin approached Robert Mitchum who, despite appreciating the script, sternly declined, asking Friedkin [...] "Why would I want to go to Ecuador for two or three months to fall out of a truck? I can do that outside my house." [...] Another candidate for Scanlon's role was Warren Oates, but since the movie's budget escalated beyond $10 million, the studio decided that [...] " [...] name wasn't big enough to carry <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> picture."
