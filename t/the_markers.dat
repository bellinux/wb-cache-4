5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the state {{boundaries}} marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments {{in the area to}} combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along meridian and parallel lines. Beginning in the 1860s, these lines were surveyed and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>marker</b> {{variable}} technique {{offers a}} practical and easy method {{to address the}} validity threat on account of common method variance {{to the findings of}} individual studies. Hawever, the validity of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> variable technique has not been established. This paper examines the validity threat to <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> variable technique arising from multiple criteria for the selection of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> variable proposed in the literature. Our findings shaw that the conclusions that can be drawn under different criteria are significantly and substantially different, raising doubts about the validity of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> variable technique. Proposals for developing theoretically grounded criteria for identifying <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> variable correlation are discussed. Imponantly, our analysis suggests that the second lowest correlation of the criterion variable may be a more valid method for selecting <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> variable correlation...|$|R
40|$|Dogs {{can use the}} {{placement}} of an arbitrary marker to locate hidden food in an object-choice situation. We tested domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in three studies aimed at pinning down the relative contributions of the human's hand and <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> itself. We baited one of two cups (outside of the dogs' view) and gave the dog a communicative cue to find the food. Study 1 systematically varied dogs' perceptual access to <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> placing event, so that dogs saw either the whole human, the hand only, <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> only, or nothing. Follow-up trials investigated the effect of removing <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> before <b>the</b> dog's choice. Dogs used <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> as a communicative cue even when it had been removed prior to the dog's choice and attached more importance to this cue than to the hand that placed it although {{the presence of the}} hand boosted performance when it appeared together with <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> Study 2 directly contrasted the importance of the hand and <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> and revealed that the effect of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> diminished if it had been associated with both cups. In contrast touching both cups with the hand had no effect on performance. Study 3 investigated whether <b>the</b> means of <b>marker</b> placement (intentional or accidental) had an effect on dogs' choices. Results showed that dogs did not differentiate intentional and accidental placing of <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> These results suggest that dogs use <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> as a genuine communicative cue quite independently from the experimenter's actions...|$|R
30|$|If <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> is unique, {{then the}} {{detection}} of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> itself restricts <b>the</b> possible camera positions already. From four coplanar points, the full 6 D pose can be calculated with respect to <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> with an accuracy {{that depends on the}} distance to <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> and on <b>the</b> distance between the points. In case more markers are seen at the same time, and their geometric relation is known, our pose estimation will use all available detected points in a more precise estimation. In a demo situation with multiple <b>markers,</b> <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> positions are usually measured by hand.|$|R
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|Each person’s DNA {{contains}} {{two copies of}} these markers—one copy inherited from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> at each person’s DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence, depending on <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> inherited from the parents.|$|E

50|$|A life is lost if the Qix touches any uncompleted Stix or if <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> is {{touched by}} any of the Sparx - enemies that {{traverse}} all playfield edges except uncompleted Stix. In addition, if <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> stops while drawing, a fuse will appear and burn along the uncompleted Stix toward the marker; if it reaches <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> <b>the</b> player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the player moves <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> again. <b>The</b> player has no defenses against the enemies and must out-maneuver them in order to survive.|$|R

25|$|A {{genetic map}} is a map {{based on the}} {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between <b>the</b> <b>markers,</b> the smaller the physical distance between them. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, eye colour) derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.|$|E
25|$|The typical unit {{of genetic}} linkage is the {{centimorgan}} (cM). A distance of 1 cM between two markers means that <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> are separated to different chromosomes on average once per 100 meioses.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>marker(s)</b> {{must stand}} {{directly}} in front of the tackled player; not doing so will result in a penalty. A marker must also not move towards the ball until the play-the-ball has been completed, otherwise he will be penalised.|$|E
50|$|As {{a special}} case, {{if any of}} <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> symbols are {{followed}} by a zero byte (0), <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> symbol itself is written to the decompressed buffer.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>marker</b> must be {{powered by}} a single 12 gram powerlet - {{limiting}} the number of shots to 15 to 40 depending on the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this task}} will be {{developed}} in a virtual game that connects with real-time cameras that can recognize a <b>marker.</b> So <b>the</b> game will be seen performing on <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> Rubber Ball game system is divided into several subsystems namely the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> displaying <b>the</b> game on <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> and gaming systems.

50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> {{traditional}} paintball <b>marker,</b> <b>the</b> TPX uses a blow forward action. To prepare {{this action}} for fire {{the operator must}} simply pull the trigger back once. This initial pull will not fire <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> but trigger pulls performed after it will until all air is removed from <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mounted {{vertically}} in {{the front}} of the Matrix is the inline regulator. This regulator has two functions; the first of which reduces the pressure of the air coming into <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> before it enters <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> <b>the</b> second of these functions is to act as a fore grip to stabilize holding <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> <b>The</b> regulator is necessary because the Matrix operates at a low pressure, about 140 psi. Because the amount of air used to fire a paintball is a fixed amount, the pressure that this air is allowed into <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> is what controls the velocity at which the paintball is shot. Changing the amount of pressure allowed into <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> in turn changes the velocity: lower pressure results in a lower velocity. The regulator on the Matrix allows CO2 or compressed air to be used as a propellant.|$|R
25|$|There are {{predictable}} inheritance patterns {{at certain}} locations (called loci) {{in the human}} genome, which {{have been found to}} be useful in determining identity and biological relationships. These loci contain specific DNA markers that scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> used are Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to high-dimensional clustering {{is to identify}} cell populations using one marker {{at a time and}} then combine them to produce higher-dimensional clusters. This functionality was first implemented in FlowJo. The flowType algorithm builds on this framework by allowing the exclusion of <b>the</b> <b>markers.</b> This enables the development of statistical tools (e.g. RchyOptimyx) that can investigate the importance of each marker and exclude high-dimensional redundancies.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, David Wall of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, {{launched}} {{a lawsuit against}} the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney, Nova Scotia, when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of <b>the</b> <b>markers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hoppers {{contain the}} paintball supply for a marker, much as {{magazines}} contain the ammunition {{on a regular}} rifle. With few exceptions, hoppers are all mounted above <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> and most use gravity as the ultimate force to get the balls in <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> That is to say, if most hoppers are turned upside down, <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> will not be fed with balls and will cease to fire.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the anthropometrics and acanthosis nigricans (AN) {{in a sample}} of 7, 337 children at two assessments. Four groups of children were identified based on the presence of AN at both time points: those who never had <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> those who gained <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> those who lost <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> and those who maintained <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> Group differences in height, weight, body composition, and the amount of change in these variables over time were explored. Our findings demonstrated that children who maintain or gain the ANmarker had the greatest height, weight, and body composition changes over time. It is apparent that <b>the</b> AN <b>marker</b> does disappear in some children and that this is associated with lower weight gain and body composition loss. If interventions can be developed targeting children who present with <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> it is likely that their risk of developing type 2 diabetes could be reduced...|$|R
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> is {{most often}} picked up during the game, historically, in the boy's game, <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> was kicked {{sequentially}} back through the course on the return trip and then kicked out.|$|R
25|$|From Unalakleet, {{the route}} {{passes through the}} hills to the Iñupiat village of Shaktoolik. The route then passes across the frozen Norton Bay to Koyuk; <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> on the bay are young spruce trees frozen into holes in the ice. The route then swings west along the south shore of Seward Peninsula though the tiny villages of Elim, Golovin and White Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Waldorf pedagogues {{consider}} that readiness for formal learning depends upon increased independence of character, temperament, habits, and memory, one of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> {{of which is}} the loss of the baby teeth. Formal instruction in reading, writing, and other academic disciplines are therefore not introduced until students enter the elementary school, when pupils are around seven years of age. Steiner believed that engaging young children in abstract intellectual activity too early would adversely affect their growth and development.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a hit-up is for the player in the acting-halfback position to run the ball himself, without passing. This is often performed by quicker players as {{they are able to}} round <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> and make ground for their side. Some teams use repeated dummy-half scoots with the intention of playing the ball quickly and catching defenders before they are able to properly position themselves. This is known as quick ball or 'getting a roll on'.|$|E
5000|$|The T68 M249 Magazine is {{designed}} after the real M249 magazine for the Squad Automatic Weapon; this magazine holds 200 [...]68-caliber paintballs, like most hoppers. Unlike a hopper. though, this magazine feeds from beneath <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> <b>The</b> magazine is battery-operated and is force-fed {{into the chamber}} of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> prior to each shot. This magazine is currently compatible only with <b>the</b> T68 <b>markers.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{essentially}} a partial trisomy. However, sometimes <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> is composed of inactive genetic material and {{has little or no}} effect. There are some markers that are passed down through a family with little effect. There are some markers that arise as new events. Often, markers are not passed down as they can be lost during cell division due to their small size. There are some individuals who have multiple markers. When special studies are performed to identify the material more conclusions can be drawn about the effects of <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> There is a more common marker called inverted duplication of chromosome 15. This is a specific syndrome that has developmental delays and physical variations and often seizures as its features. A difficult situation arises when a marker chromosome is found on a prenatal study such as amniocentesis. If <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> is not one of <b>the</b> more common <b>markers</b> and neither parent has <b>the</b> <b>marker,</b> it can be very difficult to predict the effects of <b>the</b> <b>marker.</b> Usually, if a parent carries <b>the</b> same <b>marker,</b> <b>the</b> effect is much less.|$|R
50|$|Testing for <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> {{does not}} have {{variable}} success depending on the allele at <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> locus or <b>the</b> allele at the target locus (the gene of interest that determines the trait of interest).|$|R
