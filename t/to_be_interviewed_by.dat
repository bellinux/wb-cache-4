Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>by</b> Christmas TV and apologise on camera.

5|$|Dick Tracy was {{released}} in 1990 to mixed reviews, but was a success {{at the box office}} and at awards time. It picked up seven Academy Award nominations and won in three of the categories: Best Original Song, Best Makeup and Best Art Direction.

5|$|In {{the opening}} {{weekend of the}} season Manchester United faced Leicester City at Old Trafford, and went a goal down within seven minutes; Muzzy Izzet’s cross was met by Emile Heskey to scuff {{the ball into the}} net before Tony Cottee– the scorer in the {{previous}} season’s corresponding fixture– added a second with fifteen minutes remaining. Teddy Sheringham’s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point, setting a precedent for things to come. The team's first away game at West Ham followed, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at. Bottles and stones were directed at the team coach prior to kick-off. After the game Ferguson, his players, and the Manchester United staff refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>by</b> the press or television.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>by</b> Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Breitbart and O'Keefe on September 11 {{announced}} that O'Keefe {{would not agree}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>by</b> CNN staff. They said that CNN favored ACORN in its coverage. But, CNN had reported on ACORN-related issues of alleged voter registration fraud (which were not substantiated). O'Keefe said he felt CNN's early coverage had been slanted in favor of ACORN, because CNN had interviewed both ACORN staff members and defenders.|$|E

His second son Po Than Gyaung had gone underground in 1976 to join the Communists like his brother before him. U Hla's death at the age of 72, in August 1982, was unexpected by most who knew him as someone who had always lived a healthy life, although he developed diabetes later in life.

500|$|The PEC {{eventually}} denied Kuan a COE on {{the grounds}} that he lacked the requisite financial credentials and responsibility required by the Constitution. Kuan was not given an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>by</b> the PEC despite the negative media reports, which were speculated to have contributed to the PEC's decision not to issue him a COE. The Prime Minister's press secretary said that public hearings would [...] "politicise the decision" [...] and therefore affect the independence of the PEC. It has been argued that since the PEC's decision not to issue a COE may cast aspersions on an applicant's character, the lack of a procedure for the candidate to respond to negative findings in a public setting is contrary to the principles of natural justice. This is even more so given that the PEC is immune from defamatory actions.|$|E
