2500|$|Peter Townsend was {{appointed}} Comptroller of her mother's restructured household. By 1953, he was divorced {{from his first}} wife and proposed marriage to Margaret. He was 16 years her senior and had two children from his previous marriage. Margaret accepted and informed her sister, the Queen, of her desire to marry Townsend.

Queen Mary had recently died, and Elizabeth {{was about to be}} crowned. After her coronation, she planned to tour the Commonwealth for six months.

Churchill informed the Queen that the Dominion prime ministers were unanimously against the marriage and that Parliament would not approve a marriage that would be unrecognized by the Church of England unless Margaret renounced her rights to the throne.|$|E
