500|$|Meridian is rightly {{considered}} an architectural treasure trove being one the nations most intact cities from <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century. [...] Architecture students {{from around the}} nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups {{as part of their}} coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. [...] The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. [...] The Frank Fort-designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. [...] Noted California architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian {{as well as in the}} Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. [...] He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. [...] One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. [...] The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of post office built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills.|$|E

The Cardinals were founded in 1898 in Chicago, as the Morgan Athletic Club, and {{became known as the}} Cardinals shortly after, due to the color of their jerseys. [...] Around <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century, they were known as the Racine Cardinals, and in 1920, they became a charter member of the American Professional Football League, which would eventually become the National Football League. [...] Upon their move to Phoenix, the Cardinals originally played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe. [...] In 2006 they moved to the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in suburban Glendale. Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, where they lost 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{was born}} to a {{sharecropping}} couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works (1877–1965) and Samuel Jones Davis (1873–1945), in the now-ghost town of Beech Springs southeast of Quitman in Jackson Parish in north Louisiana. The family was so poor that young Jimmie {{did not have a}} bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old. Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to the New York Times, [...] "Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had the slightest idea when it really was." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Davis was not sure exactly how old he was, noting only that he was born around <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century." [...] The birth date listed on his Country Music Hall of Fame plaque is September 11, 1902. However, the 1900 US Census attests to his being born in September 1899.|$|E

60|$|In {{the temple}} of Pallas Athênê, where the Luck of Troy lay always on her altar, the custom was that priestesses kept watch, each for two hours, all through the night, and {{soldiers}} kept guard within call. So one night Ulysses slept there, on the floor, with other distressed people, seeking for dreams from the Gods. He lay still all through the night till <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> priestess came to watch. The priestess used to {{walk up and down}} with bare feet among the dreaming people, having a torch in her hand, and muttering hymns to the Goddess. Then Ulysses, when her back was turned, slipped the gold phial out of his rags, and let it lie on the polished floor beside him. When the priestess came back again, the light from her torch fell on the glittering phial, and she stooped and picked it up, and looked at it curiously. There came from it a sweet fragrance, and she opened it, and tasted the drug. It seemed to her the sweetest thing that ever she had tasted, and she took more and more, and then closed the phial and laid it down, and went along murmuring her hymn.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{the most}} utter misery that had yet befallen the Jews. Temple, Priesthood, all gone! [...] "We see not our tokens; {{there is not one}} prophet more;" [...] and yet that was the great time of glorious Jewish martyrdoms. Numbers of the {{faithful}} were burnt to death together in a cave, where they had met to keep the Sabbath day; two women who had circumcised their babes, had them hung round their necks, and were then pitched from the highest part of the wall of Jerusalem; and the aged scribe, Eleazar, who was ninety years old, when swine's flesh was forced into his mouth, spat it out again, and was scourged to death, saying with his last breath that he bore all this suffering because he feared the Lord. A mother and her seven sons were taken, and as each refused to share in the idol rite and break the Law, they were put to death, one by one, with horrible tortures, each before the eyes of his remaining brethren; but the parting words of all were full of high hope and constancy. [...] "The Lord looketh on us, and hath comfort in us," [...] said one. [...] "The King of the world shall raise us up who have died for His laws unto everlasting life," [...] was spoken by another. [...] "Think not our nation is forsaken of God, but abide awhile and behold His great power, how He will torment thee and thy seed," [...] said another, (for they were as yet only faithful Jews, hope and forgiveness for their persecutors was for the Christian.) The mother stood firmly by while each son's limbs were cut off, and he was roasted to death over a fire; and all her words were to exhort them to be stedfast, and to assure them their Creator could raise them if they died for Him. When <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> son came, the persecutors, pitying his youth, entreated him to change his resolution, promising him riches and prosperity if he would adore the idol, and even calling his mother to plead with him. Then the noble woman laughed the tyrant to scorn. [...] "Have pity on me, my son," [...] she began; but it was not by saving his life, but by losing it, that she bade him show pity on her, so that she might receive him again with his brethren. He made a still fuller confession than the rest--he was slain by a still more savage torture; and then his mother, blessing God, died gloriously like her sons. Others fled, and lived in the mountains, lurking in caves, and feeding on wild roots and herbs. Of such St. Paul says, [...] "They were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented: of whom the world was not worthy." ...|$|E
