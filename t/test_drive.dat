30|$|The {{following}} figures provide {{statistical data}} concerning the <b>test</b> <b>drives.</b> The <b>test</b> protocol consisted of ten questions: name of the operator, name of the attendant, number of passengers, test route (short or long), test purpose, test audience, weather conditions, road conditions, problems during the drive and applied solutions to the problem. During the test period from April 24 th to November 22 th a total of 240 <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> were conducted, of which 102 were on the long route and 138 on the short route. The <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> covered a distance of almost 341  km. During these <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> 874 persons were transported. The majority of <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> (70 %) were conducted in sunny and dry or slight cloudy conditions. For almost 28 % of the <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> it was cloudy respectively very cloudy and rainy. 0.7 % of the <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> took place during snowfall. However, <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> and a few rides in heavy rain had to be stopped because of weather conditions. The majority of the <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> (45 %) was conducted for demonstration purposes for an external audience. These demonstration drives were held either for company delegations, representatives from road or transport authorities, for the press or for private persons. 38 % of the drives were used for operator training, <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> for data collection or <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> without external passengers immediately after the commissioning of the self-driving shuttle. Almost 18 % of the trips were conducted for technical tests. Here, for example, optimizations were made on the route guidance, the software was updated, brake tests were made, or the functionality and/or range of the sensors were tested.|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} beforehand, {{we performed}} several <b>test</b> <b>drives</b> {{in order to}} capture data which is required to verify our approach towards trajectory estimation. For each of these <b>test</b> <b>drives,</b> we were using the identical mobile terminal with the same subscriber identity module (SIM). The handset in use was a Samsung S 3 running the Android 4.1. 1 JellyBean operating system. During the <b>test</b> <b>drives,</b> the handset was used to initiate speech and data sessions. Throughout the entire drives, the mobile terminal’s current position was recorded using a GPS tracker. Additional information regarding the actual serving cell sites and location areas was logged in order to derive the effective position of potential HO or LAU events. At a later time, the Austrian MNO A 1 provided us with the subscriber information and events captured in the core network for the particular <b>test</b> <b>drives.</b> These data were used to derive the subscriber’s trajectory, whereas the recorded data was required for validation and quantification.|$|R

25|$|Early experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss {{engineer}} François Isaac de Rivaz {{built an}} engine powered by internal combustion of a {{hydrogen and oxygen}} mixture. In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a <b>test</b> <b>drive</b> from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in 1860, covering some nine kilometres in about three hours. A later version was propelled by coal gas. A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in 1884.|$|E
25|$|Karthikeyan started 2001 in the Formula Nippon F3000 Championship, {{finishing}} the year amongst the top ten.

Impressed with his performance, he was then offered a <b>test</b> <b>drive</b> in the Jordan-Honda EJ11 at Silverstone in September. Karthikeyan again tested for Jordan, at Mugello in Italy on 5 October, finishing just half a second off the pace off Jordan's lead driver Jean Alesi.|$|E

These results earned him another Formula One <b>test</b> <b>drive,</b> this time with the Minardi team. He was offered a race drive for the 2004 season, but was unable to raise the necessary sponsorship funds to seal the deal. During the year, he married Pavarna.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, 1980 {{the second}} of Silja's new ships was {{launched}} at Wärtsilä's Perno shipyard. Subsequently she was towed to Wärtsilä's Turku shipyard where the construction was finished. On April 28, 1981 the ship was named MS Silvia Regina by HM Queen Silvia of Sweden. Twelve days later the ship left on a two-day <b>test</b> <b>drive,</b> and finally on 10 June 1981 she was delivered to her new owners. Instead of being delivered directly to Rederi AB Svea, the ship's new owners were Suomen Yritysrahoitus, who chartered the ship immediately to Svea Line (Finland). Due to this arrangement the ship was registered in Helsinki and not Stockholm, the usual homeport of Rederi AB Svea's ships.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, TVR {{built its}} first {{original}} chassis. The Hotchkis-style rear suspension used the live axle from a Morris Eight, {{and the front}} suspension was of an independent trailing-arm design. The engine was a Ford 1172cc sidevalve from a 1936 van, tuned to 35hp. Even before the car was bodied, it was crashed by the man hired to create the bodywork, Les Dale. After repairs, the body was styled and built from aluminium, and painted British racing green. Although neither Wilkinson nor Pickard found the finished bodywork to be very aesthetically appealing, it was functional, {{and the two men}} conducted the first successful <b>test</b> <b>drive</b> on the runway at Squires Gate aerodrome in 1949. Later that year, TVR Number One was sold to Wilkinson's cousin for £325. It was later crashed and salvaged for parts.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was the German Formula 3 Championship in 1989, where Frentzen competed against many future stars {{including}} Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger. At the time, {{there was a big}} push by Bernie Ecclestone to have a German driver in the Formula One World Championship, so the ONS (the German National Motorsports committee) decided to support both Frentzen and Schumacher. The ONS put up the reward of a Formula One test to the driver who first would take a victory in a Formula 3 race. This ultimately ended up being Schumacher, in a controversial race at Zeltweg, Austria in which Frentzen claimed Schumacher had forced him off the track. However, Schumacher did not get the Formula One <b>test</b> <b>drive</b> anyway; Karl Wendlinger won the German Formula 3 Championship and Frentzen became joint runner-up with Schumacher (the two finishing on identical points totals).|$|E
40|$|Test driven {{development}} is a software development technique, that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. First the developer writes a failing test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. This thesis describes this technique and methods, that are usually used. The first chapter describes the conditions {{that led to the}} appearance of <b>test</b> <b>driven</b> development. It also presents this thesis and some other works, that researched the usefulness of this programming approach. Next, the software testing, that is a base for <b>test</b> <b>driven</b> development, is described. The theory, advantages and limitations are described in chapter Testno voden razvoj. Fourth chapter covers methods and tools that help with development. We also tried <b>test</b> <b>driven</b> development in practise. We have written a simple application using the rules and techniques that this approach describes. In the thesis are included some practical examples from this application, that represent the development process and methods used by <b>test</b> <b>driven</b> development. ...|$|R

25|$|In August 2013, Nissan {{announced}} {{its plans to}} launch several driverless cars by 2020. The company is building in Japan a dedicated autonomous driving proving ground, {{to be completed in}} 2014.

In September 2013, the Leaf fitted the prototype Advanced Driver Assistance System was granted a license plate that allows to drive it on Japanese public roads. The testing car will be used by Nissan engineers to evaluate how its in-house autonomous driving software performs in the real-world. Time spent on public roads will help refine the car’s software for fully automated driving. The autonomous Leaf was demonstrated on public roads {{for the first time at}} a media event held in Japan in November 2013. The Leaf drove on the Sagami Expressway in Kanagawa prefecture, near Tokyo. Nissan vice chairman Toshiyuki Shiga and the prefecture’s Governor, Yuji Kuroiwa, rode in the car during the test.|$|E
