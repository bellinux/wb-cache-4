50|$|The wave of arson {{eventually}} {{ended with}} the help of community groups such as Banana Kelly CIA, Inc. and SEBCO (<b>South</b> East <b>Bronx</b> Community Organization), who worked to bring recognition and protect the remaining apartment buildings in <b>the</b> greater <b>South</b> <b>Bronx.</b> What was left was a wasteland of abandoned buildings, vacant lots, filthy streets and a severe lack of even basic commercial amenities. During this period of time, the neighborhood was dealt another blow as violent crime hit historic highs during the crack epidemic.

25|$|By 1970, the 130,000-resident {{population}} of Brownsville was 77% black and 19% Puerto Rican.

These changes corresponded to overall increases in segregation and inequality in New York City, {{as well as to the}} replacement of blue-collar with white-collar jobs. The area gained a reputation for violence and poverty that was similar to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Bronx's,</b> a reputation that persisted through the 21st century.|$|R
