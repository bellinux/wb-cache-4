5|$|A {{sample of}} {{beryllium}} was bombarded with alpha rays from {{the decay of}} radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of <b>the</b> <b>neutron.</b> This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.|$|E
50|$|Fast Breeder Reactors, {{are called}} fast {{because they have}} no {{moderator}} slowing down <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> (light water, heavy water or graphite) and breed more fuel than they consume. The word 'fast' in fast breeder thus refers to the speed of <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> in <b>the</b> reactor's core. The higher <b>the</b> energy <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> have, <b>the</b> higher the breeding ratio or the more uranium that is changed into plutonium.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are certain}} {{conditions}} {{that must be}} met for this chain reaction to occur. Certain fuel densities are necessary, or <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> won't impact {{a sufficient number of}} other unstable atoms before escaping the reactor. It is also easier for unstable nuclei to absorb <b>neutrons</b> when <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> are traveling at a certain speed. For , slower neutrons are more likely to cause a fission reaction. In order to slow down <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> in a reactor core, a moderator is used. Water is the most common moderator in use today. <b>The</b> <b>neutrons</b> are slowed down as they travel through the water. As the reaction speeds up and the temperature of the reactor increases, increasing the temperature of <b>the</b> moderator, <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> aren’t slowed down as effectively. This in turn reduces the rate of nuclear reactions inside the core, since <b>the</b> faster <b>neutrons</b> aren’t as easy to absorb. This effect, the negative temperature coefficient, makes the reactor inherently resistant to [...] "excursion", or a sudden, uncontrolled increase in temperature.|$|R

5|$|For his {{discovery}} of <b>the</b> <b>neutron,</b> Chadwick {{was awarded the}} Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His discovery of <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> {{made it possible to}} produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, again {{using his}} {{knowledge}} of the cyclotron and inventing what are now known as time-of-flight techniques, Alvarez created a mono-energetic beam of thermal neutrons. With this he began a long series of experiments, collaborating with Felix Bloch, to measure the magnetic moment of <b>the</b> <b>neutron.</b> Their result of , published in 1940, was a major advance over earlier work.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1974, {{under the}} advice of Abdus Salam, PAEC formed another group, [...] "Fast Neutron Physics Group", under Samar Mubarakmand. <b>The</b> Fast <b>Neutron</b> Physics Group (FNPG) took {{research}} in and examined the problems in <b>the</b> science of <b>neutron,</b> a subatomic particle. <b>The</b> Fast <b>Neutron</b> Physics Group calculated the numerical ranges of neutrons — how much power would be produced by <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> — and <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>neutrons</b> — determined <b>the</b> number of <b>neutrons</b> would be produced — in a device. <b>The</b> Fast <b>Neutron</b> Physics Group discovered the treatment process for the Fast, thermal and slow <b>neutrons,</b> and examined <b>the</b> behaviour of <b>Neutron</b> fluxes, and Neutron sources in particle accelerator installed at PINSTECH. <b>The</b> Fast <b>Neutron</b> Physics Group used the R-process to determine the neutrons' behaviour in the fissionable device.|$|R

It is the activation levels of these moderator materials caused by interactions with <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> that are of particular concern.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{distribution}} of <b>neutron</b> energies {{in a nuclear}} reactor differs from <b>the</b> fission <b>neutron</b> spectrum due to the slowing down of neutrons in elastic and inelastic collisions with fuel, coolant and construction material. Neutrons slow down in elastic and inelastic collisions, until they are absorbed via Neutron capture or lost by leakage. <b>Neutron</b> economy is <b>the</b> balanced account, in a reactor, of <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> created and <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> lost through absorption by non-fuel elements, resonance absorption by fuel, and leakage while fast and thermal energy ranges.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, McDaniel became {{director}} of LNS and served until {{he retired from}} the Cornell faculty in 1985. He research included important measurements with each of the series of LNS accelerators, including studies lambda-meson photo production, K-meson production, and measurements of <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> electromagnetic form factors.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: <b>the</b> <b>neutron,</b> a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> but did not know it.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can {{be formed}} by <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> {{activation}} of molybdenum-98.

5000|$|The [...] "blanket" [...] {{component}} that lines the reactor vessel has two functions: it captures <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> and transfers their energy to a coolant and forces <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> {{to collide with}} lithium atoms, transforming them into tritium to fuel the reactor.

2500|$|... six protons {{for every}} neutron, {{but a small}} {{fraction}} of <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> decay before fusing in the next few hundred seconds, so at the end of nucleosynthesis there are about seven protons to every neutron, and almost all <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> are in Helium-4 nuclei.

5|$|Oppenheimer did {{important}} {{research in}} theoretical astronomy (especially {{as related to}} general relativity and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field theory, including its extension into quantum electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, which include <b>the</b> <b>neutron,</b> meson and neutron star.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive {{rubidium}} beams can {{be produced}} since 2015 at CERN's HIE-ISOLDE apparatus with sufficient intensity to consider the production of element 120 in the reaction of rubidium beams with a bismuth-209 target in a cold fusion reaction.

5|$|Stellar {{encounters}} are {{not very}} common in the disk of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, but in the dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently.

50|$|Fusion-fission designs {{essentially}} {{replace the}} lithium blanket {{with a blanket}} of fission fuel, either natural uranium ore or even nuclear waste. <b>The</b> fusion <b>neutrons</b> have more than enough energy to cause fission in the U-238, {{as well as many}} of the other elements in the fuel, including some of the transuranic waste elements. The reaction can continue even when all of the U-235 is burned off; the rate is controlled not by <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> from <b>the</b> fission events, but <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> being supplied by the fusion reactor.|$|R

5000|$|Not all {{neutrons}} are emitted as {{a direct}} product of fission; some are instead due to the radioactive decay {{of some of the}} fission fragments. <b>The</b> <b>neutrons</b> that occur directly from fission are called [...] "prompt neutrons," [...] and the ones that are a result of radioactive decay of fission fragments are called [...] "delayed neutrons." [...] <b>The</b> fraction of <b>neutrons</b> that are delayed is called β, and this fraction is typically less than 1% of all <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> in <b>the</b> chain reaction.|$|R
5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.|$|E
5|$|The infalling matter {{produced}} {{complex and}} spectacular effects. The infalling matter 'spun up' <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> star, {{due to the}} transfer of angular momentum, {{and for a few}} hundred million years, the stars formed a low-mass X-ray binary, as the infalling matter was heated to temperatures high enough to glow in X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} {{of physical and}} chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved.

50|$|Neutron capture therapy {{might be}} {{considered}} a type of particle therapy, {{but it is not}} discussed here, as the damage it does to tumors is mostly from energetic ions produced by the secondary nuclear reaction after <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> in <b>the</b> external beam are absorbed into boron-10 (or occasionally some other nuclide), and not due primarily to <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> themselves. It is therefore a type of secondary particle therapy.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} tokamak design the confinement magnets are arranged outside a [...] "blanket" [...] of liquid lithium. The lithium serves two purposes, {{one is to}} absorb <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> from <b>the</b> fusion reactions and produce tritium which is then used to fuel the reactor, and as a secondary role, as shielding to prevent those <b>neutrons</b> from reaching <b>the</b> magnets. Without the lithium blanket <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> degrade <b>the</b> magnets quite quickly.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> moderator, <b>neutrons</b> will be {{traveling}} {{in many different}} directions. To produce a good image, neutrons need to {{be traveling}} in a fairly uniform direction (generally slightly divergent). To accomplish this, an aperture (an opening that will allow neutrons to pass through it surrounded by neutron absorbing materials), limits <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> entering <b>the</b> collimator. Some length of collimator with neutron absorption materials(Eg.boron) then absorbs neutrons that are not traveling {{the length of the}} collimator in the desired direction. A tradeoff exists between image quality, and exposure time. A shorter collimation system or larger aperture will produce a more intense <b>neutron</b> beam but <b>the</b> <b>neutrons</b> will be traveling at a wider variety of angles, while a longer collimator or a smaller aperture will produce more uniformity in the direction of travel of <b>the</b> <b>neutrons,</b> but significantly fewer neutrons will be present and a longer exposure time will result.|$|R

5|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD {{from the}} University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez {{went to work}} for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of <b>the</b> <b>neutron.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its extreme rarity in nature, most {{francium}} is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from <b>the</b> <b>neutron</b> irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.|$|E
