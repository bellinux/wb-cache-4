5|$|After {{discussions with}} Lloyd and senior civil servants, Macmillan took the {{unprecedented}} step of appointing two Foreign Office cabinet ministers: Home, as Foreign Secretary, in the Lords, and Edward Heath, as Lord Privy Seal and deputy Foreign Secretary, in <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b> With British {{application for admission}} to the European Economic Community (EEC) pending, Heath was given particular responsibility for the EEC negotiations {{as well as for}} speaking in <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> on foreign affairs in general.|$|E
5|$|Brown was {{mentioned}} {{by the press}} in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner. However, no wrongdoing was found and <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b> Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. <b>The</b> <b>Commons</b> immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

If <b>the</b> <b>common</b> bile duct is of normal diameter, the distinction is usually moot, since both vessels have similar diameter, which is significantly smaller than that of the portal vein.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the English Civil War, the monarchy, House of Lords, and Privy Council {{had been}} abolished. The {{remaining}} parliamentary chamber, the House of Commons, instituted a Council of State to execute laws and to direct administrative policy. The forty-one members of the Council were elected by the House of Commons; the body was headed by Oliver Cromwell, de facto military dictator of the nation. In 1653, however, Cromwell became Lord Protector, and the Council was reduced to between thirteen and twenty-one members, all elected by <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b> In 1657, <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> granted Cromwell even greater powers, some of which were reminiscent of those enjoyed by monarchs. The Council became known as the Protector's Privy Council; its members were appointed by the Lord Protector, subject to Parliament's approval.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it was passed by <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> on 8 May {{and sent to the}} House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Several Acts of Parliament then followed. The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates {{proposed}} that the clergy pay no more than 5% of their first year's revenue (annates) to Rome.

5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It {{was only a matter of}} time before it was generally acknowledged that <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> were an integral part of that institution.|$|E

5|$|The last {{trial in}} the House of Lords was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for {{manslaughter}} (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> ignored it. The right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added {{an amendment to the}} Criminal Justice Act 1948, which <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords. The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> – gained political influence. A consensus emerged {{that in order for}} a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} his {{appointment}} Granby resigned the leadership in <b>the</b> <b>Commons,</b> feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without a leader in <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> {{for the rest of}} the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and John Charles Herries—indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted him. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.|$|E
