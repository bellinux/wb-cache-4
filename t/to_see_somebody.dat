5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
500|$|Jim is different. He {{does his}} own dirty work. Jim {{is one of}} those people who are willing to say, [...] "I didn't like your movie." [...] Directness is disarming to people who are used to sugar-coating. It's tough for people who need {{approval}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> who doesn't. Myths and legends begin to surround that kind of person.|$|E

[...] "Then {{you shall}} {{take me for}} a drive to Fifth Avenue, or <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody's</b> tomb, and my woman shall make some real Russian tea for us in my sitting-room. Really, I think I'm doing very well for the first day. Is the spell beginning to work?" ...|$|R

500|$|Bernard Brook-Partridge, a Conservative {{member of}} the Greater London Council and {{chairman}} of the Arts committee from 1977, declared, [...] "Most of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death. The worst of the punk rock groups I suppose currently are the Sex Pistols. They are unbelievably nauseating. They are the antithesis of humankind. I would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> dig a very, very large, exceedingly deep hole and drop the whole bloody lot down it." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 3, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs {{said during}} his morning press briefing, [...] "I hope that {{baseball}} awards a perfect game to that pitcher", joking that the White House was [...] "going {{to work on}} an executive order" [...] to that effect. He elaborated, [...] "To watch an umpire take responsibility and to watch a pitcher do what he did, the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there—I think that gives a lot of heart (...) I think it's tremendously heartening <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> understand that {{they made a mistake}} and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake. I think that's a good lesson in baseball." [...] Michigan state Governor Jennifer Granholm also issued a gubernatorial proclamation stating, in part, [...] "I, Jennifer M. Granholm, {{governor of the state of}} Michigan, do hereby declare Armando Galarraga to have pitched a perfect game." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his {{interview}} with AfterBuzz TV following the Top 5 elimination show, Caleb Johnson made offensive remarks about his fans who tweet him song suggestions. [...] " [...] gives access {{to a bunch of}} retards to talk to me," [...] Caleb said. [...] "I don't really enjoy having <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> telling me what song I have to sing. I think at this point of the competition, I can pick and choose my own songs and represent me. I don't need 10,000 people saying, 'You should sing this, you should sing that. Listen to me!' Fortunately, guys, I'm going to listen to myself, {{whether you like it or}} not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you let {{the boys}} who are going up know we've been there?" [...] he said. [...] "It might {{encourage}} them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>somebody</b> has come out alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{mother is}} much better and doesn't want me, I ought <b>to</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> I promised <b>to</b> take a parcel to--I feel I ought. And yet, as you have just come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me--I suppose you don't approve of my going out while you are here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain’t a bad sort o’ face, now I come {{to look at}} it," [...] {{said the}} baffled mate, {{regarding}} it closely. [...] "Seems <b>to</b> me I’ve <b>seen</b> <b>somebody</b> very much like it—a girl, I think—but I can’t say where." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bill Wrenn {{suddenly}} {{popped into}} being and demanded: [...] "Look here, you; I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> in authority. I {{want to know}} what I can ship as." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who's in {{the next}} room?--who? [...] I seemed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Somebody</b> in the dawning passing through, [...] Unknown to me." [...] "Nay: you saw nought. He passed invisibly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Randy Portney!" [...] It was Fred Dobson's voice, but so {{thin and}} hollow Randy {{scarcely}} recognized it. [...] "Oh, how glad I am <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> I know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{four o'clock}} this {{afternoon}} {{a man came}} to the house for Arthur <b>to</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> that was sick among his church bunch. Old lady Gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch, so that left me pretty much alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the first}} hour of that night I did not sleep a wink, my mind was so troubled. I felt as though I were not really Bernard's wife, but {{some sort of a}} {{guardian}} angel who was watching over him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>somebody</b> else made him happy. After I had thus been in the depths of grief for a long while, I became angry.|$|R
5000|$|Thunderstorms {{may make}} at least the home-made långfil go thin. Placing it in a {{refrigerator}} was said to help against this due to it acting as a Faraday cage. After a thunderstorm, it was common to send children to the neighbors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>somebody</b> had some långfil that was still good {{and ask for a}} spoonful in order to restart the own culture, which often sat in the pantry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Jim, get {{her under}} shelter {{as quick as}} you can. Leave the team at Wheatland. I'll come after it {{in a day or}} two. I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> in town, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|By this time, {{all sitting}} at the table were on a broad grin. As a matter of fact, the sour-looking man was not liked in that locality, and the {{boarders}} were glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> [...] "take him down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope you'll get it. Blackburn's won't have a chance, anyhow, and I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> get {{it away from}} the School House. They've had it much too long. They're {{beginning}} to look on it as their right. But who are your men?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't expect. I {{just wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, or <b>somebody,</b> and I {{thought of the}} Navajos. Couldn't I live with them? Why can't we stay here or in a canyon across the Colorado where there's plenty of game?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed? Then I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him shoot--at <b>somebody</b> else," [...] {{answered}} Acour, for {{in those days}} such skill was of interest to all soldiers. [...] "Kill Hugh de Cressi if you will, friend, but spare Grey Dick; he might be useful." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....The {{first time}} I saw {{the album was}} in the [...] "Albanija" [...] record store in Belgrade. I got in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>somebody</b> would buy my album. And there were these two girls looking for an album, but the saleswoman {{did not know the}} song. [...] "...something like: my friend, and a woman, and my friend again..." [...] I {{realized}} that it was my album, [...] "Le Femme De Mon Ami", from Enrico Macias. The saleswoman said that they didn't have the album. I was a bit disdainful, since the album was mine, and I knew that they did in fact have it: [...] "Up there, there it is," [...] I said. The saleswoman put it on so they could listen to it. The girls were delighted. One of them commented, while holding and looking at the album cover: [...] "It's true, he sings fine, but he is nasty!" [...] I got out as quickly as I could, so they wouldn't recognize me...|$|R
60|$|Dick hurried {{his steps}} and called Tom, {{and then went}} back to the other hallway, unwilling to leave it {{unguarded}} even for a few minutes. He was just in time <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> disappearing down a broad flight of stairs to the floor below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear old Max," [...] said Grace, {{her brown}} eyes shining {{with pride and}} pleasure. [...] "That is so like him. He is such a dear brother and I haven't seen him for four years. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> who knows him so well is {{next best thing to}} seeing himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cer'nly am glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody!</b> I been 'most {{scared to}} death. Been here alone two weeks now. Got a shotgun, but if anybody come, I guess they'd {{take it away}} from me. I was brought up nice, no rough-house or---- Say, did you folks come to see the gold-mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> very {{superior}} <b>to</b> any one I have <b>seen</b> yet, <b>to</b> be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) {{is out of}} the question: and I do {{not wish}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any such person. I would rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{only way}} {{people will have}} the trust to give their all to their job is if they feel like their {{contribution}} is recognized and valued. And if they <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> else higher above them just because of a good résumé, or they <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> else promoted who they don’t think deserves it, you’re done.|$|R
6000|$|The rapidity {{with which}} the sick man got off the poop must have {{astonished}} the boatswain. But Powell, {{at the moment he}} opened the door leading into the saloon from the quarter-deck, had managed to control his agitation. He entered swiftly but without noise and found himself in the dark part of the saloon, the strong sheen of the lamp {{on the other side of}} the curtains visible only above the rod on which they ran. The door of Mr Smith's cabin was in that dark part. He passed by it assuring himself by a quick side glance that it was imperfectly closed. [...] "Yes," [...] he said to me. [...] "The old man must have been watching through the crack. Of that I am certain; but it was not for me that he was watching and listening. Horrible! Surely he must have been startled <b>to</b> hear and <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> he did not expect. He could not possibly guess why I was coming in, but I suppose he must have been concerned." [...] Concerned indeed! He must have been thunderstruck, appalled.|$|R
60|$|Miriam, who {{for a week}} or more {{had been}} beset by the very unusual desire that she would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>{{somebody}}</b> and speak to somebody who did not live at Cobhurst, willingly agreed to assist in escorting the strangers, and Cicely having joined the group, they all walked toward the barn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} rather strangled {{you with my}} own hands," [...] said Almayer, in an expressionless voice which was such a {{contrast}} to the desperate bitterness of his feelings that it surprised even himself. He asked himself who spoke, and, after looking slowly round as if expecting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody,</b> turned again his eyes towards the sea.|$|E
60|$|In a moment, {{the whole}} company {{were on their}} feet. That {{somebody}} was assassinated by somebody vindicating {{a difference of opinion}} was the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> fall, but only saw {{a man and a woman}} standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English.|$|E
5000|$|Advertising is {{what you}} do when you can't go <b>see</b> <b>somebody.</b> That's all it is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let ’em wonder," [...] {{said the}} embarrassed Mr. Barrett. [...] "I shall {{go and see}} all my old friends in their turn; casual-like. You might let ’em hear that I’ve been <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you before seeing them, and then, if they’re {{thinking}} any nonsense, it’ll be a hint. I’m stopping in town while the house is being decorated; next time I come down I’ll call and <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{dare say}} this pretty thing has got over it--how much {{character}} she has got!--and I suppose she'll <b>see</b> <b>somebody</b> else." ...|$|R
