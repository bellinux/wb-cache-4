40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that behavioral variability can come under control of discriminative stimuli. The present experiment further examined discriminative control of variability in a novel way by using the discrimination-reversal paradigm. Eight pigeons responded under a multiple schedule of Vary and Yoke components signaled by different-colored keylights. In <b>the</b> <b>Vary</b> component, 4 -response sequences that differed from the previous 10 produced food, while in the Yoke component, any 4 -response sequence had a fixed probability of producing food, yoked to <b>the</b> prior <b>Vary</b> component. Following stability in this procedure, the key colors signaling <b>the</b> <b>Vary</b> and Yoke components were reversed across four successive conditions. Across the experiment, variability of keypeck sequences was higher in <b>the</b> <b>Vary</b> than in <b>the</b> Yoke component. Across successive reversals, the level of variability in <b>the</b> <b>Vary</b> component adapted more rapidly to the reversed contingencies, while the rate of adaptation in the Yoke component did not change systematically. These results are interpreted in terms of the different contingencies in <b>the</b> <b>Vary</b> and Yoke components. In addition, the improvement in the rate of adaptation across successive reversals in <b>the</b> <b>Vary</b> component appears consistent with a proactive interference account of discrimination-reversal performance. These results join others in suggesting that variability may be an operant dimension of behavior...|$|R

5|$|In the 14th {{century the}} kings {{continued}} to build vesara or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style gopuras {{to meet their}} ritualistic needs.

5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{prior to}} modern DNA analysis developed remarkably prescient theories. The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948. In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for <b>the</b> <b>varied</b> expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} <b>the</b> <b>varied</b> origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
