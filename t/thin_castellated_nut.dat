5000|$|A <b>castellated</b> <b>nut,</b> {{also called}} a castle nut or slotted nut, is a nut with slots (notches) cut into one end. [...] The {{name comes from}} the nutâ€™s {{resemblance}} to the crenellated parapet of a medieval castle.|$|R
5000|$|Split pins are {{frequently}} used to secure other fasteners, e.g. clevis pins, {{as well as}} being used in combination with hardboard discs as a traditional joining technique for teddy bears. A common application of this is when used to secure a <b>castellated</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: lock washers, jam nuts, specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} <b>castellated</b> <b>nuts,</b> nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|R
50|$|A Palnut is a {{locking device}} for nuts made of stamped sheet metal, {{and is a}} {{registered}} trademark. The palnut is screwed on the bolt {{on top of an}} ordinary nut, and has a series of protruding barbs that locks the nut in place when the nut is tightened. The Palnut itself is reusable. A Palnut should not be used as a substitute for a positive locking device such as a <b>castellated</b> <b>nut</b> or nuts with safety wire.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam <b>nuts,</b> thread-locking fluid, <b>castellated</b> <b>nuts</b> and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
50|$|Steel-framework can {{be easily}} {{constructed}} of electrical conduit. One flattens {{the end of a}} strut and drills bolt holes at the needed length. A single bolt secures a vertex of struts. The nuts are usually set with removable locking compound, or if the dome is portable, have a <b>castellated</b> <b>nut</b> with a cotter pin. This is the standard way to construct domes for jungle gyms.|$|R
5000|$|Trevenson Chapel {{was built}} in 1806-09 as a Church of England chapel-of-ease in the parish of Illogan. The chapel has a <b>thin</b> <b>castellated</b> west tower; the pointed windows are of granite with cast iron tracery. This tracery has been {{replaced}} with modern replicas.|$|R
50|$|The RC30 front {{suspension}} {{was made}} by Showa and had wheel and brake pads that had quick-release mountings. The rear wheel carried a brake disc to the inside and a chain sprocket {{to the outside of}} a single-sided swingarm (originally patented by ELF of France), and attached with a single <b>castellated</b> <b>nut</b> and cotter pin. It was also equipped with fully adjustable Showa suspension which, as it only had a single seat thus focusing suspension performance, gave superior ride and handling characteristics. The engine and low storage position of the fuel in the fuel tank combined to give a low centre of gravity which aided its handling prowess. Further statements of its hand-built quality were shown in a full stainless steel 4-2-1 exhaust system, alloy fuel tank and hand laid fibreglass bodywork.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, Australia, {{and around}} the world, baling wire was used in {{mechanical}} hay balers pulled behind a tractor. The automated balers used a wire twister that first cut then twisted {{the ends of the}} wire such that the bale kept its shape after the baler had pressed the hay into a tight rectangular bale. These hay balers were in common use up until the late 1980s. When the hay was fed to livestock the wire was cut and often hung in bundles or stored in barrels or metal drums around the farm. Farmers used the soft wire for temporary repairs of almost everything you could think of on the farm, from fences, old leather horse harnesses, head stalls and bridles, to pins to keep <b>castellated</b> <b>nuts</b> in place on the tractor. Even tiny screwdrivers were made by cutting a short length of wire and looping one end for grip. The other end was then flattened and shaped to make a screwdriver for specialized tasks like replacing the tiny screws in reading glasses.|$|R
