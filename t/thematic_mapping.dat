40|$|Abstract: <b>Thematic</b> <b>maps</b> in {{the context}} of {{information}} retrieval are tools that graphically present documents and characterising terms. We investigated the usefulness of <b>thematic</b> <b>maps</b> in a laboratory experiment comparing a <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> with a command language interface. Six subjects solved eight search tasks producing ten hours of logged and tape-recorded data. The experiment revealed no improvement in the quality of the documents retrieved when using a <b>thematic</b> <b>map.</b> A majority of the subjects considered the <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> pleasant to use and thought that useful information was found on the map. However, searching took longer time using the <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> compared with the boolean interface. Several subjects occasionally misinterpreted the structure and content of the map. The common expectation that <b>thematic</b> <b>maps</b> improve information retrieval lacks empirical underpinning and is in the present study only weakly confirmed...|$|R

40|$|In <b>thematic</b> <b>maps</b> {{information}} is traditionally represented in a one-polygon-one class method which assumes each polygon in the map {{can be assigned}} unambiguously to a single class. Additionally, <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> classes {{are assumed to be}} exhaustive and mutually exclusive. The introduction of fuzzy classifications overcomes the traditional limitations on the mutually exclusive nature of map classes assigning varying levels of class membership for individual map polygons. As a consequence, fuzzy set theory expands the conventional assumptions regarding the total areal extent of <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> classes. Considering that a map polygon may simultaneously belong to more than one <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> class, the total areal extent of all classes in a <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> need not be equal to the geographical extent of the study area. Although this apparent paradox has already been noted in previous papers, as far as we know, an analytical formulation of the influence of fuzzy classifications on the areal extent of <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> classes has never been provided. This Letter offers an analytical solution to evaluate the total areal extent of <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> classes as a function of fuzzy class membership levels...|$|R

5000|$|Although <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping</b> first {{arose in}} the late 17th century, Borden Dent felt that “the significant, {{formative}} years {{in the development of}} portrayal techniques in thematic cartography were the first six decades of the nineteenth century.” [...] During this golden age of <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping,</b> the great majority of techniques used to depict thematic data were developed. These included “proportional point symbols, the line of equal value (isoline), the choropleth and shading, the dot method, class intervals, and flow lines.” [...] As the main cartographic tools for depicting thematic data had already been developed, much of Dent’s career was spent researching and examining ways in which the cartographer could better communicate with the map reader.|$|E

40|$|In {{the remote}} sensing literature, {{a number of}} {{fuzziness}} indices have been proposed for quantifying the uncertainty in categorical labelling of <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> locations. However, despite its vast potential applicability, none seems to be generally preferred. A more complete summary of fuzziness at the pixel level is possible if, instead of one single index, one uses a parametric index family whose members have varying sensitivities {{to the presence of}} rare and abundant <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> classes. While traditional indices supply point descriptions of fuzziness, according to a parametric fuzziness family H., there is a continuum of possible fuzziness measures that differ in their sensitivity to the presence of dominant and rare <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> classes within the fuzzy partition {{as a function of the}} parameter alpha. Therefore, changing alpha allows for vector description of the uncertainty in categorical labelling of <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> locations. The purpose of this letter is thus to introduce a parametric generalization of Shannon's entropy to quantify the fuzziness of <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> cells. Comparing <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> cells by fuzziness profiles may be considered a very useful feature of parametric fuzziness indices, for example, to evaluate how the presence of dominant, subdominant or rare classes within the fuzzy partition influence uncertainty as data are transformed within a geographical information system...|$|R

50|$|Like {{other forms}} of <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping,</b> the dasymetric method was created and {{historically}} used {{because of the need}} for accurate visualization methods of population data. Dasymetric maps are not widely used because of the limited options for producing them with automated tools such as geographic information systems. Although fields such as public health still rely on choropleth maps, dasymetric maps are becoming more prevalent in developing fields, such as conservation and sustainable development. Researchers in various fields of science are pushing the way for use of so-called critical GIS and to make dasymetric mapping techniques more easily applicable with modern technology.|$|E
