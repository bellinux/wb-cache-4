We focus on two equilibria: a currency competition equilibrium, {{in which the}} 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 currency (dollars) is spent first and the 2 ̆ 7 bad 2 ̆ 7 (risky home) currency is kept for later purchases, and a Gresham 2 ̆ 7 s Law equilibrium in which agents do the reverse. We prove that for the Gresham 2 ̆ 7 s Law equilibrium to prevail, trading frictions and the home currency risk must be small. Otherwise, extensive currency substitution occurs and the currency competition equilibrium prevails. Interestingly, because <b>transaction</b> <b>velocity</b> is endogenous, we demonstrate that as the home currency risk rises, currency substitution causes {{a decline in the}} <b>transaction</b> <b>velocity</b> of the bad currency while increasing it for the good currency...|$|E

40|$|I extend {{and discuss}} the model of asset {{liquidity}} by Lester, Postlewaite, and Wright (2007, 2008). I consider a model with decentralized trades in which claims on a real and divisible asset serve as means of payment. A recognizability problem is introduced by assuming that the claims on the asset can be counterfeited at a positive cost. This formalization nests the models by Lagos and Rocheteau (2008) and Geromichalos, Licari, and Suarez-Lledo (2007) {{in which there is}} no recognizability problem, and Lester, Postlewaite, and Wright (2007), in which counterfeits can be produced at no cost. Even though no counterfeiting occurs in equilibrium, the recognizability problem affects the composition of trades: buyers consume less and spend a lower fraction of their asset holdings in matches where sellers are uninformed. Both the asset price and its liquidity (as measured by its <b>transaction</b> <b>velocity)</b> depend on the recognizability of the asset. The asset is more liquid and its return is lower if either the sellers’ ability to recognize counterfeits or the cost of producing counterfeits increases.

40|$|Readers of this Review are doubtlessly {{familiar}} with the famous equation of exchange, MV=PQ, frequently employed to analyze the price level effects of monetary shocks. One might think the algebraic formulation of the equation is {{an outgrowth of the}} 20 th century tendency toward mathematical modeling and statistical testing. Indeed, textbooks typically associate the <b>transaction</b> <b>velocity</b> version of the equation with Irving Fisher and the alternative Cambridge cash balance version with A. C. Pigou, two early 20 th century proponents of the application of mathematics to economic analysis. The equation, however, is considerably older, as Thomas M. Humphrey demonstrates in “Algebraic Quantity Equations Before Fisher and Pigou. ” Humphrey traces the origins and prehistory of the equation in both its variants, showing that Fisher and Pigou were the inheritors of a long tradition. In fact, by 1900 the equation of exchange was over 120 years old and at least nineteen writers in five countries had presented versions of the equation. Certain versions were even more intricate than the equations of Fisher and Pigou. As early as 1771, writers had produced formulas showing that excessive growth of the money stock causes inflation.

40|$|A rich body of queuing {{research}} has focused on how consumers are affected by waiting lines, {{as well as on the}} development and optimization of efficient strategies to enhance consumers’ feelings while standing in line. In times when many service industries are affected by waiting lines, such insights hold major importance. While much of this {{research has}} focused on queues from a waiting perspective, it has more or less neglected to investigate what may happen once a consumer reaches the head of the queue and starts using the service. Thus, the question arises of whether (and how) consumers feel influenced by other people waiting behind them once it is their turn, and if so, what effect queue length has on their service experience. In this regard, much research has referred to the universal concept of crowding to explain the impact of the presence of other customers in a store on an individual. However, the question remains whether more situation-specific factors/feelings exist that take account of the peculiarity in the current queuing context, namely that the progress of the customers waiting in line is solely dependent on the <b>transaction</b> <b>velocity</b> of the customer who is currently using the service. Having raised these issues, this dissertation investigates the impact of queues on consumers who are currently using a service, as well as two means to control for it. For this purpose, a conceptual framework primarily based on social impact theory, social norms, and social pressure is developed and examined through a series of four studies. In particular, this framework postulates that the service experience/evaluation of a customer currently using a service will decrease as the waiting line at his/her back increases and that this effect is mediated by perceptions of social pressure to finish the transaction quickly. Furthermore, providing a social cue making the consumer feel that it is appropriate to use the service as intensely as desired, as well as organizing people waiting at the current consumer’s back in a take-a-number wait system rather than a traditional waiting line will bolster – at least under specific circumstances – the current consumer’s service experience against the adverse effect of queue length. By demonstrating that queue length has adverse effects even on consumers at the head of the queue and, by suggesting possibilities to bolster consumers against this effect, these findings make important contributions to theory and practice...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{reported}} for many countries, including the UK, that income velocity has been highly variable around a declining trend in recent years. This paper advances {{the hypothesis that}} this {{is connected to the}} behaviour of <b>transactions</b> <b>velocity</b> which has been more stable. The connection lies with endogeneity of broad money. Briefly, we argue that the demand for credit and hence the broad money stock, is influenced by total spending in the economy, rather than spending only on newly produced goods and services. Since total spending in the economy has generally increased relative to GDP (mainly because of asset transactions) credit and money have expanded more rapidly than GDP, with the resulting fall in income velocity. Using quarterly data from 1975 to 2008, we estimate a vector error correction with income velocity as the dependent variable and the ratio of total to GDP transactions as an explanatory variable. The results show substantial support for the hypothesis. Authors...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{intractable}} problems {{in the area of}} monetary economics is the measurement of cash payments. Whereas the stock of currency in circulation [C] is well defined and readily measured, the <b>transactions</b> <b>velocity</b> of currency [Vc] (the average number of times currency turns over in any given period) is difficult to measure. This paper examines alternative methods for estimating the average velocity of currency and the denomination specific velocity of cash employing data for the Netherlands. Estimates of the volume of cash payments are necessary to meaningfully measure the volume of total payments [MV] in an economy and hence, the total volume of transactions [PT]. Once the volume of cash payments is known, it is possible to employ Fisher’s equation of exchange [MV=PT] as a more general conceptual and empirical alternative to Keynes’ more limited income-expenditure [Y= C+I+G] identity.

40|$|The Lax-Hopf formula {{simplifies}} the value function of an intertemporal optimization (infinite dimensional) problem {{associated with a}} convex transaction-cost function which depends only on the <b>transactions</b> (<b>velocities)</b> of a commodity evolution: it states that the value function {{is equal to the}} marginal fonction of a finite dimensional problem with respect to durations and average ransactions, much simpler to solve. The average velocity of the value function on a investment temporal window is regarded as an enrichment, proportional to the profit and inversely proportional to the investment duration. At optimum, the Lax-Hopf formula implies that the enrichment is equal to the cost of the average transaction on the investment temporal window. In this study, we generalize the Lax-Hopf formula when the transaction-cost function depends also on time and commodity, for reducing the infinite dimensional problem to a finite dimensional problem. For that purpose, we introduce the moderated ansaction-cost function which depends only on the duration and on a commodity. Here again, the generalized Lax-Hopf formula reduces the computation of the value function to the marginal fonction of an optimization problem on durations and commodities involving the moderated transaction cost function. At optimum, the enrichment of the value function is still equal to the moderated transition cost-function of average transaction...|$|R

40|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Japanese economy {{following}} the banking crisis of the late 1990 s is the drastic decline in the velocity of money and the consequent decline in the price level. Based on the inventory model of money demand a la Alvarez, Atkeson, and Edmond (2009), we explore how macroeconomic shocks affect the velocity. Households in the model are subject to a multiple-period cash-in-advance constraint in which {{the portion of the}} payment in cash, which we call the liquidity requirement, varies according to the credit service supply in the economy. Extracting various shocks underlying the velocity variations from 1990 to 2010, we find that an increase in the liquidity requirement is the key driver of the decline in velocity. Particularly important is the channel stemming from householdsf expectations about the future liquidity requirement. During the Japanese banking crisis and the global financial crisis, credit service is disrupted and households expect the disruption to last long. Since they demand additional money for a higher liquidity requirement for current and future <b>transactions,</b> the <b>velocity</b> and the price level decrease, even though the growth rate of money stock then exceeds that of consumption.

However, it differs based on product and its popularity, the offer type (packaged game, virtual currency to a game or subscription service), storefront and geography. Existing fraud policies and models make decisions independently for each transaction based on <b>transaction</b> attributes, payment <b>velocities,</b> user characteristics, and other relevant information. However, suspicious transactions may still evade detection and hence we propose a broad learning approach leveraging a graph based perspective to uncover relationships among suspicious transactions, i. e., inter-transaction dependency. Our focus is to detect suspicious transactions by capturing common fraudulent behaviors {{that would not be}} considered suspicious when being considered in isolation. In this paper, we present HitFraud that leverages heterogeneous information networks for collective fraud detection by exploring correlated and fast evolving fraudulent behaviors. First, a heterogeneous information network is designed to link entities of interest in the transaction database via different semantics. Then, graph based features are efficiently discovered from the network exploiting the concept of meta-paths, and decisions on frauds are made collectively on test instances. Experiments on real-world payment transaction data from Electronic Arts demonstrate that the prediction performance is effectively boosted by HitFraud with fast convergence where the computation of meta-path based features is largely optimized.
