40|$|We {{consider}} {{the use of}} localized Marangoni forcing to produce a thermocapillary "microfluidic valve" {{that allows us to}} control the downstream flow of a thin film of viscous fluid. To this end, we analyze the influence of this localized forcing on a flow driven by a combination of uniform Marangoni stresses and gravity in a one-dimensional model. Long-time solutions approach states that can be categorized in two classes, where the film thickness downstream of the forcing is: (1) determined by the upstream thickness, or (11) controlled by the forcing amplitude. The type 11 solutions are stable stationary hydraulic jumps for thin films. We give careful attention to the relation between the forcing and the downstream film flow for the resulting bi-stable solutions.

40|$|A new Petrov-Galerkin {{method for}} {{computations}} of fully enclosed flows is developed. It {{makes use of}} divergence-free basis functions which also satisfy the boundary conditions for the velocity field. This allows {{the elimination of the}} unknown pressure, and subsequently decreases the computational cost substantially when the problem is formulated in primitive variables. The computational procedure reduces to the solution of a system of non-linear first order ordinary differential equations for the spectral expansion coefficients, or, in the steady case, to the solution of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The paper illustrates the effectiveness of the method by solving the problem of the two-dimensional thermoconvective flow in a rectangular cavity at high Rayleigh numbers. The results compare favorably with ones obtained using finite-difference and pseudo-spectral schemes in terms of accuracy, and memory and computational time requirements.

40|$|Abstract: Feedback {{flow control}} of a {{three-dimensional}} wake behind a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of Re = 100 was investigated. A combination of numerical simulations, exper-iments, and control theory was used to understand the flow field {{and to develop a}} sensor configuration, a flow state estimator, and a controller. The flow field was analysed by using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in two dimensions, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional sensor placements were investigated. The controller input was computed from the POD time coefficients, and actuation was performed by using rigid cylinder motion nor-mal to the free stream. In the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computations,</b> feedback was shown to effectively reduce the drag and the fluctuating lift force.

In two dimensions, the curvature of the tip scales like t 3, where t is time, and the peak undergoes an overshoot in acceleration which evolves like t− 5. In three dimensions, the jet evolves towards an axisymmetric shape, and the curvature and the overshoot in acceleration obey asymptotic laws in t 2 and t− 4, respectively.

40|$|An {{inviscid}} {{model for}} complete axial flow turbomachinery is adopted, which replaces the blades with throughflow surfaces. The {{main effects of}} the real blades on the flow are modelled by blade forces. The inverse method predicts the axisymmetric flow field and throughflow surface geometry for a specified distribution of azimuthal inviscid force. This quantity drives the meridional distribution of rotor shaft power. Euler equations are solved by an implicit upwind finite-volume scheme. The time-marching computation includes an evolutionary equation for each throughflow surface, which is solved by implicit finite differences. Standard optimisation algorithms are used to find distributions of azimuthal force that minimise some sample cost functions. The optimal blade shapes are given by the corresponding geometrical solutions of the inverse problem.

Experimental results from a wind tunnel test show that a slot blowing with high momentum coefficient will increase the lift of the airfoil (compared to no blowing) and delay flow separation.
