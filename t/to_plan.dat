5|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> and strategize, {{much like}} {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen}} in the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the ability <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> activities around these events, and <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
