5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing <b>the</b> <b>daring</b> escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E

50|$|They were {{designed}} to ship three twin 40 mm /60 Bofors mounts STAAG Mark II, but the midships one was later replaced by the lighter and more reliable twin Mount Mark V. This meant that <b>the</b> <b>Darings</b> could engage two targets at long range and two at close range under fully automatic radar directed-control, an enormous improvement over their predecessors. Two of <b>the</b> Australian <b>Darings</b> were instead fitted with two twin and two single Bofors mounts. Radar Type 293 was carried on the foremast for target indication.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> first Australian <b>Daring</b> {{was laid}} down in 1949. By 1950, it was already {{apparent}} that <b>the</b> Australian <b>Darings</b> would not be completed on time, as the Australian dockyards were experiencing difficulty in {{keeping up with the}} construction schedule. To compensate for this, the RAN unsuccessfully attempted to purchase two of <b>the</b> <b>Darings</b> under construction in the United Kingdom, and considered acquiring ships from the United States Navy despite the logistical difficulties in supplying and maintaining American vessels in a predominately British-designed fleet. Only three ships were completed; , , and [...] were commissioned between 1957 and 1959. By the time they were commissioned, the cost of each ship had increased from A£2.6 million to A£7 million.|$|R

25|$|To many Confederates, <b>the</b> <b>daring</b> {{expedition}} {{behind enemy}} lines became known as The Great Raid of 1863, and was initially hailed in the newspapers. However, along with Gettysburg and Vicksburg, it was another {{in a string of}} defeats for the Confederate army that summer. Some Northern newspapers derisively labeled Morgan's expedition as The Calico Raid, in reference to the raiders' propensity for procuring personal goods from local stores and houses.|$|E
25|$|What links them {{is their}} common {{connection}} to Emerson (a passage from whom Whitman {{printed on the}} second edition of Leaves of Grass), and <b>the</b> <b>daring</b> originality of their visions.

25|$|Other Jacobite {{recruits}} {{could be}} described as adventurers– desperate men who saw the cause as a solution to their (usually financial) problems.

25|$|Partially {{because of}} the {{population}} pressures, property crime became a business both for the criminals and those who fed off of the criminals. Major crime lords like Jonathan Wild invented new schemes for stealing, and newspapers were eager to report crime. Biographies of <b>the</b> <b>daring</b> criminals became popular, which spawned fictional biographies of fictional criminals. Cautionary tales of country women abused by sophisticated rakes (such as Anne Bond) and libertines in the city were popular fare, and they prompted fictional accounts of exemplary women abused (or narrowly escaping abuse).|$|E
