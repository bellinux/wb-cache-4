30|$|Turning to {{value-added}} estimates on {{a gender}} <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap in numeracy (panel B, Fig. 1), males outperform females over virtually the whole distribution {{and in all}} grades. Additionally, the gender numeracy <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap is more pronounced at {{the upper end of}} the distribution. A widening gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap in numeracy is also observed as students advance through school. Furthermore, the steeper slope of the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap line at the higher end of the distribution (more visible for grades 5 and 7) suggests that the observed widening gender numeracy <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap favouring male students may have been driven by top performing students.

30|$|This {{paper has}} {{documented}} {{that differences in}} pre-school cognitive skills considerably help explain the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gaps observed during primary and early secondary school years. While these findings cannot be interpreted as causal, given the descriptive nature of the paper, they contribute to understanding gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gaps, with results useful in informing the direction of future interventions aimed at reducing the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap. Many questions remain unanswered, with {{a large part of}} the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap remaining unexplained, and no increased understanding in why the <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap favouring males is largely due to differences in returns, indicating more research on the relationship between gender and educational achievement is warranted.|$|R

40|$|John J. Cannell's late 1980 's “Lake Wobegon ” reports {{suggested}} widespread deliberate educator {{manipulation of}} norm-referenced standardized test (NRT) administrations and results, resulting in artificial <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains. The Cannell {{studies have been}} referenced in education research since, but as evidence that high stakes (and not cheating or lax security) cause <b>test</b> <b>score</b> inflation. This article examines that research and Cannell's data for evidence that high stakes cause <b>test</b> <b>score</b> inflation. No such evidence is found. Indeed, the evidence indicates that, if anything, the absence of high stakes is associated with artificial <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains. The variable most highly correlated with <b>test</b> <b>score</b> inflation is general performance on achievement tests, with traditionally low-performing states exhibiting more <b>test</b> <b>score</b> inflation—on low-stakes norm-referenced tests—than traditionally high-performing states, {{regardless of whether or}} not a state also maintains a high-stakes testing program. The unsupported high-stakes-cause-test-score-inflation hypothesis seems to derive from the surreptitious substitution of an antiquated definition of the term “high stakes ” and a few studies afflicted with left-out-variable bias. The source of test-score inflation is lax test security, regardless the stakes of the assessment...|$|R
30|$|From {{a policy}} perspective, it is {{important}} to understand the patterns as well as the factors contributing to the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap, not only at the mean but along the distribution of the <b>test</b> <b>score.</b> One of the results from this study is the finding that pre-school cognitive skills play a significant role in explaining the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap observed up to seventh grade. This result suggests that policies aiming at reducing the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap should be implemented even prior to students enrolling at school. This policy implication is in line with that from the skill development literature, which usually shows early intervention is more beneficial than late intervention (Heckman 2000). Another finding of the heterogeneity of the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap across the distribution indicates that such policies should be targeted at some particular student groups.|$|R

30|$|The {{ordinary}} {{least squares}} (OLS) method is first applied to estimate the mean gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap using the three specifications described above. Unreported statistics from our data show that {{for both males and}} females the mean <b>test</b> <b>score</b> is usually not the same as the median, suggesting that the <b>test</b> <b>score</b> distribution is skewed and contains extreme values. This distributional characteristic suggests the need for examining the determinants of academic achievement not only at the mean but also along the whole distribution (Koenker and Bassett 1978; Firpo et al. 2009). The unconditional quantile regression (UQR) technique is employed to investigate the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap along the entire distribution.|$|R

30|$|Drawing on {{the recent}} and nationally {{representative}} panel of Australian children, the patterns and factors contributing to the gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap in academic achievements over the first 7  years of schooling have been examined. Regression results reveal that males excel at numeracy across all grades, whether at means or along the distribution. While mean regression results indicate a male advantage in grade 3 reading, quantile regression results show this gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap is generally driven by those in the middle or top of the distribution. In addition, while mean regressions do not show noticeable gender differences in grade 7 reading, quantile regression results suggest females do outperform males {{at the lower end}} of the <b>test</b> <b>score</b> distribution. The regression results herein also reveal a widening gender <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gap in numeracy as students advance in their schooling.

PerlThis {{exploratory}} correlational study {{seeks to}} answer the question of whether a relationship exists between student average <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains on state exams and teachers’ rating of values on the Schwartz Values Survey. Eighty-seven randomly selected Kansas teachers of math and/or reading, grades four through eight, participated. Student <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains were paired with teachers and averaged. The results of these backward stepwise entries of multiple regressions using SPSS software are reported. Significant relationships with large effect sizes are reported for teacher values and student <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains in reading and math. Models of teacher values are found that account for thirty-two percent of the average student <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains in reading and for forty-three percent of the average student <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains in mathematics. The significant model of values with the greatest adjusted relationship with reading <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains is described as the Relational Teacher Value Type. The valuing of True Friendship (close supportive friends) and the valuing of Sense of Belonging (feeling that others care about me) proved to be the most powerful indicators of student reading score gains within this type. The significant model of values with the greatest adjusted relationship with mathematics <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains is described as the Well-Being Teacher Value Type. The valuing of Healthy (not being sick physically or mentally), the valuing of Reciprocation of Favors (avoidance of indebtedness), and Self Respect (belief in one’s own worth) proved to be the most powerful indicators of student mathematics <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains within this type. The significant value items within each of the above types’ models are discussed regarding possible reasons for their relationships to student <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains. A value that is found significant for both reading and mathematics teachers in accounting for student <b>test</b> <b>score</b> gains is Moderate (avoiding extremes of feeling and action). Of the teachers in the study that taught mathematics and reading, their students’ mathematics score gains did not correlate in a statistically significant way with their students’ reading score gains, suggesting that a teacher’s ability to teach math {{has little to do with}} a teacher’s ability to teach reading...|$|R
