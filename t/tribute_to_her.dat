5|$|When Queen Beatrix succeeded {{her mother}} Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen {{decided to keep}} the holiday on 30 April as a <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother.

The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E
