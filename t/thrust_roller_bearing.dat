40|$|Abstract: The risk {{of fatigue}} failure of {{elements}} working in rolling contact conditions (such as railway wheels, rolling bearings, etc.) {{is a significant}} issue with respect to safety and economy. In this case the complex and non-proportional stress state with pulsating three dimensional compression occurs. Therefore, the analysis of fatigue life of structures working in rolling contact conditions can be performed using recently proposed multiaxial high-cycle fatigue criteria. However, there is no hypothesis that could be universally accepted for calculations of fatigue strength. Furthermore, not all criteria proposed in literature for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) analysis can predict it. In the paper, the most popular criteria based on different theories are investigated in the application to RCF problem. Moreover, modification of the popular Dang Van hypothesis is proposed. The problem of free and tractive rolling contact fatigue is analysed on {{the example of a}} cylindrical crane wheel and spherical <b>thrust</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing...</b>|$|E

The copper additive was in colloidal form, with an inner core of Cu 2 + atoms covered by surfactants to form stable reverse micelles that are completely dispersible {{in the base}} oil.

The tribological performance was investigated using atomic force microscopy, a microtribometer, a pin-on-disk tribometer in combination with continuous and high-resolution wear measurements with radionuclide technique, and high pressure stressing in a <b>thrust</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig.

40|$|Neutron {{scattering}} at {{extremes of}} pressure {{is a powerful}} tool for studying the response of structural and magnetic properties of materials on microscopic level to applied stresses. However, experimental neutron studies require a relatively large sample volume, which makes it necessary to use rather large presses. One of the most commonly used high-pressure devices in neutron diffraction experiments is the Paris-Edinburgh (P-E) press. This compact hydraulic press has been successfully used at various neutron facilities across the world for over 20 years. However, there are some limitations imposed by the design of the press and this project addressed two of them. The first objective of this research was {{to solve the problem of}} the spatial restriction on the scattered beam imposed by the tie-rods of the P-E press which results in the limited access to the reciprocal space of a single-crystalline sample. In order to overcome this challenge a rotating device has been designed and built to work with the existing P-E press mainframe. The purpose of the device is to rotate the anvils at a high load in a controlled fashion so that neutron diffraction data can be collected from the sample at particular angles. A number of technical challenges had to be overcome in the design process. One of the problems was caused by the significant friction in the commercially available <b>thrust</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> at loads above 25 tonnes. To resolve this issue a set of custom-designed hydraulic bearings has been developed. In these bearings a thin layer of oil separates the two parts that can rotate with respect to each other...|$|R

50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls.

Bearing failure appears as a run-out in some applications, which is a critical factor for precision. However, previous studies have only focused on failure mechanisms, such as spalling. In this study, two types of wear models were used to predict the thrust bearings run-out: Linear and non-linear mechanisms.

The length of the roller and {{the diameter of the}} wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|Rotating {{machines}} serves {{an important}} role in many different applications. Extensive research has been made, manly during the last century, in order to develop these systems and understand the dynamics. The theory of rotordynamics differs in many fundamental aspects from structural dynamics and is therefore usually treated as an own research area. In rotordynamical applications there exist several qualitatively different concepts. For example super- and subcritical machines supported on different types of bearings like ball-, roller- or journal bearings etc. At the early stage of the product development, the problem is often to find a general tool which can be used for dynamical evaluation of these concepts. Many concepts also contain significant nonlinearities which need to be studied separately. One such nonlinearity is a clearance which arises between a fixed support and an axially movable bearing assembly. Another nonlinear effect is the loss of contact which can occur in preloaded spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> The aim is hence to present a method to dynamically evaluate different rotordynamical concepts, describe nonlinear effects due to these contact problems and suggest suitable design parameters. For the concept evaluation a linear model which captured the gyroscopic effect is proposed, while the contact problems are handled with nonlinear models (usually piecewise linear). The governing equations of motion are solved analytically in the linear case but needs to be simulated in the nonlinear cases. However, in some special cases it is possible to find steady state solutions even for the contact problems. Simulations of design spaces, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, contact forces etc. have been used to study the systems. In order to evaluate different concept, design spaces spanned by a requirement variable and three design parameters are plotted. These are four dimensional plots where the variations of the requirement variables are visualised by colours. This is done both for the unbalance response and an impact in order to include both the homogenous and particular solution. In the clearance problem bifurcation diagrams and Poincaré maps indicates that multi-, quasi- or chaotic motions are possible which in many cases include impacts. When stabilising rods are applied the unstable areas (positive maximum Lyapunov exponent) are reduced. In the case with the spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> nonperiodic motions are found. The stability shows strong dependency on the amount of preload. A method to dynamically evaluate rotordynamical concepts is suggested. Some especially interesting ranges of the design parameters which give low vibrations are presented. It has further been shown that strong nonlinear dynamics which may lead to failure can be expected in systems with clearance between the stator and bearing assembly. One {{way to get rid of}} such unwanted vibrations is to apply stabilising rods. It is than important to choose the right parameters since otherwise worse conditions may occur. In systems supported by preloaded spherical <b>roller</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> it is important that the preloading is high enough. Otherwise jump phenomenon and nonperiodic motions can arise. An expression of the limit preload of going in or out of full contact has been derived which can be used to choose a suitable preloading.

This paper puts forward a vibration signal de-noising method based upon improved intrinsic timescale decomposition (ITD); fuzzy entropy is then extracted as the fault feature of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> Essentially the fault diagnosis of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{is a process of}} pattern recognition. Targeting the limitation of existing pattern recog-nition methods, a new pattern recognition method – variable predictive model-based class discriminate (VPMCD) – is introduced into <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault identification. In the original VPMCD classifier, however, only the regression model could be used to predict, which will reduce the prediction’s accuracy when the relation between features is complicated. Aimed at this defect, a kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate (KVPMCD) pattern recognition method is presented in this paper. The kriging model is composed of a regression model and a correlation model, of which the correlation model is a local deviation that is created {{on the basis of a}} global model, to make up for the shortcomings of the simple regression model in the original VPMCD.
