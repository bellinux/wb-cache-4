5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the pitcher.|$|E
5|$|The first {{verdict in}} the case was handed down on 29 August 2012 by Judge Jyotsna Yagnik. The special trial court convicted Maya Kodnani, the sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Naroda and former Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat, and Bajrang Dal {{politician}} Babu Bajrangi under Indian Penal Code Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder). It also convicted 30 other people of murder, criminal conspiracy and other criminal charges, and acquitted 29 accused, giving them the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> as there was lack of evidence against them. Kodnai was the first woman, MLA and minister to be convicted in the Gujarat riot case. Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado and accomplices were convicted of rape and murder along with accomplices.|$|E
5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> {{was given to the}} batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E

5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141. Soon after, Compton, the last of the specialist batsmen, nearly departed when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails.

40|$|Harry Frankfurt {{has argued}} that Descartes’s madness <b>doubt</b> in <b>the</b> First Meditation is {{importantly}} different from his dreaming <b>doubt.</b> <b>The</b> madness <b>doubt</b> {{does not provide a}} reason for <b>doubting</b> <b>the</b> senses since were the meditator to suppose he was mad his ability to successfully complete the philosophical investigation he sets for himself in the first few pages of the Meditations would be undermined. I argue that Frankfurt’s interpretation of Descartes’s madness doubt is mistaken and that it should be understood as playing the same role as his more famous dreaming doubt.

Method Cross-sectional study carried out in a reference hospital, between September and November 2012. The sample was composed of 50 individuals divided in two groups, of which 25 caregivers of children submitted to cheiloplasty, and 25 of children submitted to palatoplasty. <b>The</b> <b>doubts</b> were identified by an interview applied during the preoperative nursing consultation and were then categorized by similarity. Descriptive statistics was used for analysis of the outcomes. Results Concerning cheiloplasty, <b>the</b> <b>doubts</b> were related to feeding (36 %), hygiene and healing (24 % each), pain and infection (8 % each). With regard to palatoplasty, <b>the</b> <b>doubts</b> were related to feeding (48 %), hygiene (24 %), pain (16 %), bleeding (8 %) and infection (4 %).

25|$|Identity cards {{became the}} subject of {{paranoia}} as this form of identification allowed the reinvention of personal identity through illegal forging; during the genocide, “mistakes” were often made because of this flexibility in identity. In particular, because a Rwandan’s ethnic identity was solely traced through paternal lineage, there was considerable difficulty in establishing true paternity. Furthermore, inter-marriage particularly in the Southern region of the country furthered suspicion over Hutu or Tutsi paternity. Though forging was rare, <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> over ethnic identity served as proof that unlike the rhetoric of Rwandan government, and that of the preceding Belgian colonizers, ethnicity was not primordialist in nature. Instead, ethnicity was a socially-constructed, superimposed identity that could potentially be changed, regardless of identity card issuance.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, {{the great}} God Zurvan existed alone. Desiring {{offspring}} {{that would create}} “heaven and hell and everything in between”, Zurvan sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards {{the end of this}} period, androgyne Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and in the moment of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for <b>the</b> <b>doubt.</b> Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan’s decision, which He then communicated to His brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity (Zaehner, 1955:419-428).|$|E

25|$|A 'probable combatant' {{is someone}} killed at a {{location}} {{and at a time}} during which an armed confrontation was going on, who appears most likely – but not certain – to have been an active participant in the fighting. For example, in many cases where an incident has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties, the only information available is that an individual was killed when Israeli soldiers returned fire in response to shots fired from a particular location. While {{it is possible that the}} person killed had not been active in the fighting and just happened to be in the vicinity of people who were, it is reasonable to assume that the number of such coincidental deaths is not particularly high. Where the accounts of an incident appear to support such a coincidence, the individual casualty has been given the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt,</b> and assigned a non-combatant status.|$|E
25|$|Lèse-majesté {{complaints}} can {{be filed}} by any person against anyone else, {{and they must}} always be formally investigated. Details of the charges are rarely made public. A section 112 defendant always meets with obstructions {{from the beginning to}} the end of a case, especially when asking for a provisional release. There are months-long pretrial detentions, and those who are charged are routinely denied bail, remaining in prison for many months awaiting trial. In most cases, convictions result in harsh sentences. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined in August 2012 that the pretrial detention of an alleged lèse-majesté offender violated international human rights law. The courts seem not to recognise the principle of granting the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to defendants. Judges have said that accusers did not have to prove the factuality of the alleged lèse-majesté material, but only to claim it is defaming in any way. Pleading guilty is seen as a move to seek a royal pardon.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} and historians have strongly contested {{what has come}} to be referred to as the “Williams thesis” in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Economic historian Stanley Engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the Industrial Revolution. Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income. Historian Richard Pares, in an article written before Williams' book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation, not before.|$|E
