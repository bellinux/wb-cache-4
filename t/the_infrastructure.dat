5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure</b> must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance <b>the</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces a}} novel and dynamic mathematical modeling methodology of infrastructure interdependency {{which has been}} examined through two case studies. <b>The</b> urban <b>infrastructure</b> interdependency was illustrated with a case example of California electricity outage in 2001. The developed Petri-Net model captured the interdependencies among <b>the</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in <b>the</b> network of a power plant, oil refinery, natural gas plant, fuel transporting pipes and tanks, water supplying pipes, and telecom. Extended Petri-Net and Markov Chain have been applied to {{the part of the}} network to assess the safety of <b>the</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> <b>The</b> developed modeling tools have been used to demonstrate <b>the</b> floodplain <b>infrastructure</b> interdependency with a case study of Canyon Ferry reservoir area having <b>the</b> <b>infrastructures</b> network of a water storage multi-purpose concrete gravity dam, penstock, power plant, transformer substation, intake pipes and pumping station, irrigation systems, municipal water supplying systems, and telecom. Additionally, gravity dam vulnerability assessment with empirical and analytical fragility curves and flood frequency analysis have been integrated with the extended Petri-Net analysis. The obtained results are reasonable showing that <b>the</b> more interdependent <b>infrastructures</b> present in <b>the</b> network, the more vulnerable they are. Also, higher degree of interdependency results in intense coupling leading towards higher vulnerability. Overall, this research contributes to the emergency management planning for safety assessment of <b>the</b> critical <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R
