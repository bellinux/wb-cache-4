500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E
2500|$|Lurie {{said that}} Riordan had been {{approached}} about an imprint several years ago, but initially dismissed the idea {{because of his}} heavy workload. Later, he reported back {{that he had been}} [...] "toying with the idea", and was [...] "willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience." [...] She also said that the imprint is planned to launch with two as-yet undetermined books. [...] "The point of making this announcement now is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about what we’re looking for.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Malan was {{a crucial}} player in <b>the</b> move <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "British" [...] taken away from [...] "British Commonwealth". This change was taken as {{affirmation}} {{of the fact that}} all member countries were voluntary and equal members.|$|R
5000|$|... 1991: Having {{done so well}} at the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest, the Thomas Kemper Soda Company was formed.

5000|$|... "Arabian Knights" [...] was {{released}} on 24 July 1981 by record label Polydor. The single peaked at number 32 on the UK Singles Chart in 1981.

2500|$|A new group, the Committee for Civic Progress, {{was formed}} to help promote the bond levy. Its members {{included}} 150 business, labor, real estate leaders. The group asked the City Council to send personal letters to their constituents, asking them to support the proposal. [...] All but three council members agreed to do so. The Greater Cleveland Convention and Visitors Bureau also helped. It issued a study in which it claimed that the convention center would generate $24 {{million a year in}} new economic activity, and printed 300,000 leaflets <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about the study's conclusions. Local radio and television stations donated time to the Committee for Civic Progress so it could run advertisements supporting the proposal.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the {{executive}} director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes [...] "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes [...] "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." [...] Foye asked his spokesman <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out.</b> Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark. Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.|$|E

This is a rum start, and I can't name the voice: but it's some one skylarking--some one that's flesh and blood, {{and you may}} lay to that." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{week later}} {{there was an}} unusually large party at mess, the depôts were very strong, and some forty {{officers}} sat down; and it being a guest night, four or five civilians were present. Dinner went on without incident until one of the mess waiters asked Wilmington whether he would take sirloin of beef or goose. He replied, [...] "B-b-b-b-beef." [...] There {{happened to be a}} slight lull in the conversation at the moment, and Wilmington's effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> made him raise his voice so that it was generally heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're awfully articulate, mamma! Now, if Mr. Wetmore were to criticise {{that picture}} he'd draw a circle round {{it in the}} air, {{and look at it}} through that, and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other, and then look at you, as if you were a figure in it, and then {{collapse}} awhile, and moan a little and gasp, 'Isn't your young lady a little too-too--' and then he'd try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> of you, and groan and suffer some more; and you'd say, 'She is, rather,' and that would give him courage, and he'd say, 'I don't mean that she's so very--' 'Of course not.' 'You understand?' 'Perfectly. I see it myself, now.' 'Well, then'---and he'd take your pencil and begin to draw--'I should give her a little more--Ah?' 'Yes, I see the difference.'--'You see the difference?' And he'd go off to some one else, and you'd know that you'd been doing the wishy-washiest thing in the world, though he hadn't spoken a word of criticism, and couldn't. But he wouldn't have noticed the expression at all; he'd have shown you where your drawing was bad. He doesn't care for what he calls the literature of a thing; he says that {{will take care of itself}} if the drawing's good. He doesn't like my doing these chic things; but I'm going to keep it up, for I think it's the nearest way to illustrating." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bennett {{suffered}} from a stammer, which Somerset Maugham described as making it [...] "painful to watch the struggle he had sometimes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> out."

5000|$|In {{his last}} bit of {{resistance}} to accepting the overthrow, Cleveland managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> for <b>the</b> Turpie Resolution changed {{to refer to the}} [...] "people" [...] rather than the [...] "Provisional Government", although the net effect was still a complete renunciation of his hopes to restore Queen Liliuokalani to power.|$|R

5000|$|... "Finally, Mozilla had {{a product}} that could compete with Microsoft. The {{question}} now was how to publicize it. Open-source management seemed to work well {{when it came to}} developing software. But open-source marketing was an unexplored concept.

50|$|The Oaks {{have gained}} {{international}} attention through their original fusion of music performance and humanitarian aid.

5000|$|The company used an {{innovative}} guerilla marketing campaign <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> {{in the early}} days. Instead of distributing a flyer in the conventional way, the company hired magicians and sleight-of-hand experts to slip the flyers surreptitiously {{into the pockets of}} members of the public. The flyers depicted [...] "Billy Beenz", the fictional company mascot. Billy had a shock of red hair and a goofy expression.|$|E
5000|$|While {{serving as}} {{chairman}} of the county commission, Nuccio found a novel method of increasing his local name recognition. A strong proponent of neighborhood improvements, Nuccio managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Nick C.

For several subsequent decades, his name was visible on sidewalks, park benches, seawalls, and virtually every other piece of concrete laid by Hillsborough County during his long tenure.|$|R
5000|$|To Whitefield [...] "the gospel {{message was}} so {{critically}} important {{that he felt}} compelled to use all earthly means <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out." [...] Thanks to widespread dissemination of print media, perhaps half of all colonists eventually heard about, read about, or read something written by Whitefield. He employed print systematically, sending advance men to put up broadsides and distribute handbills announcing his sermons. He also arranged to have his sermons published.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{new method}} of word {{segmentation}} for document images is presented. The method uses the bounding box regions to enclose the letters (characters) of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and then <b>the</b> resulting letter spaces are progressively filled to merge the character bounding boxes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> bounding boxes. <b>The</b> method holds good for inclined and irregularly distributed <b>words.</b> <b>The</b> proposed method completely avoids the line segmentation process which normally precedes word segmentation in traditional methods...|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{fundraising}} campaigns, charities {{attempt to}} interview those {{who they are}} trying to help, in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general public. However, it is common for them to encounter ongoing refusal from those in desolated situations to take pictures or to publicly share their traumatic story. This further emphasises the concept that being in an uneasy, not to say miserable, situation is a shameful one, and poverty porn in media exposes those who do not necessarily have the desire to be exposed.|$|R
