5000|$|Within families, the {{expected}} {{duties of the}} brothers and sisters differ. Brothers are responsible to do any work that requires physical labor such as farming, mostly growing root crops, both for subsistence and commercial purposes,also fishing, and fighting in wars. Brothers are required to defer to <b>their</b> <b>sisters,</b> especially the oldest sister or fahu. Brothers also must speak respectfully about <b>their</b> <b>sisters</b> and the <b>sisters</b> of <b>their</b> father because brothers rank lower than sisters. [...] Additionally, brothers are expected to support <b>their</b> <b>sisters</b> and all descendants of <b>their</b> <b>sisters,</b> but this element of the fahu system is beginning to die out.|$|R

The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine's Fund, along with an apology in the Daily Express. The McCanns received £55,000 from The Sunday Times in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police.|$|E

LAN Argentina launched passenger and cargo services in June 2005 from its home base in Buenos Aires, while LAN Ecuador launched its services in April 2003 from its home base in Guayaquil. Both airlines officially joined <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> airlines and offer alliance's services and benefits on 1 April 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} ships, Viribus Unitis, Tegetthoff, and Prinz Eugen {{were joined by}} <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> in 1915, when they bombarded Italian {{installations}} at Ancona. The Tegetthoffs attempted to sortie through the Otranto Barrage {{with the support of}} lighter ships in 1918, but failed after Szent István was by chance sunk by a small motor torpedo-boat. In 1918, Viribus Unitis was transferred to Yugoslavia, and sunk early in the morning the next day by Italian frogmen. Tegetthoff and Prinz Eugen were surrendered to Italy and France, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Anacaona's {{high status}} was {{probably}} strengthened by elements of matrilineal descent in the Taíno society, {{as described by}} Peter Martyr d'Anghiera. Taíno caciques usually passed inheritance to the eldest children of <b>their</b> <b>sisters.</b> If <b>their</b> <b>sisters</b> had no children, then they chose among the children of their brothers, and when there were none, they fell back upon one of their own.|$|R

5|$|They were {{designed}} to be lighter in weight than <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> locomotives, the Merchant Navy class, to permit use on {{a wider variety of}} routes, including in the south-west of England and the Kent coast. They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently far below their capabilities. A total of 110locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|When Arthur Compton {{earned his}} PhD in 1916, he, Karl and Wilson {{became the first}} group of three {{brothers}} to earn PhDs from Princeton. Later, they would become the first such trio to simultaneously head American colleges. <b>Their</b> <b>sister</b> Mary married a missionary, C. Herbert Rice, who became the principal of Forman Christian College in Lahore. In June 1916, Compton married Betty Charity McCloskey, a Wooster classmate and fellow graduate. They had two sons, Arthur Alan and John Joseph Compton.|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E

5000|$|Much of the {{discussion}} relates {{to the evolution of}} eusociality in insects of the order Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system. This system means that females are more closely related to <b>their</b> <b>sisters</b> than to <b>their</b> own (potential) offspring. Thus, Hamilton reasoned, a [...] "costly action" [...] would be better spent in helping to raise <b>their</b> <b>sisters,</b> rather than reproducing themselves.|$|R

5|$|A later {{study by}} paleontologists Andrew B. Heckert and Spencer G. Lucas in 1999 {{expanded}} {{the number of}} synapomorphies that diagnose Aetosauria to 18. New synapomorphies included temporal fenestrae, or holes, that opened {{on the side of}} the skull rather than the top, lateral osteoderms articulating with the paramedians, and osteoderms covering the limbs. Aetosaurus was still found to be the most basal member, but the phylogeny of more derived aetosaurs differed in that Typothorax and Paratypothorax were split into two different clades with <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> taxa being Desmatosuchus and Longosuchus, respectively. More importantly, a new aetosaur called Coahomasuchus was included in the analysis. Coahomasuchus was found to be a basal aetosaur closely related to Stagonolepis, and also appeared early in the fossil record of aetosaurs. Previously, basal members were only known from later times, occurring after more advanced aetosaurs.|$|E

The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

5|$|Gielgud {{was born}} in South Kensington, London, the third of the four {{children}} and youngest of three sons of Frank Henry Gielgud (1860–1949) and his second wife, Kate Terry-Gielgud, née Terry-Lewis (1868–1958). The two elder boys were Lewis, who became a senior official of the Red Cross and UNESCO, and Val, later head of BBC radio drama; <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> Eleanor became John's secretary for many years. On his father's side, Gielgud was of Lithuanian and Polish descent. The surname derives from Gelgaudiškis, a village in Lithuania. The Counts Gielgud had owned the Gielgudziszki Castle on the River Niemen, but their estates were confiscated after they {{took part in a}} failed uprising against Russian rule in 1830–31. Jan Gielgud took refuge in England with his family; one of his grandchildren was Frank Gielgud, whose maternal grandmother was a famous Polish actress, Aniela Aszpergerowa.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to <b>their</b> <b>sister</b> Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E

Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G.
