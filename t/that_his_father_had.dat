His son Terry reported <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> undergone dialysis three times a week, four hours a day, {{for the last five}} years. He was interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant married Rosa Louise Wilbraham, who {{was also}} from Adelaide, on 23 May 1925. The two {{had known each other}} since they were teenagers. He made Rosa's wedding ring in the {{laboratory}} from a gold nugget (from the Coolgardie Goldfields) <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> given him.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E

5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was anxious to curtail the autonomy <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{later said}} his {{biological}} {{father had a}} history of hitting his mother. James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.|$|E
5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe every word of the Bible and catechism.|$|E

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|In 1004-5 al-Maʿarri learned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> died and, in reaction, {{wrote an}} elegy where he praised his father. Years {{later he would}} travel to Baghdad where he became well {{received}} in the literary salons of the time, {{though he was a}} controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, {{he married}} Amalia Marín in a {{ceremony}} {{that took place in}} Ponce Cathedral. Later that year, he traveled to Spain to learn about its political system. There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, president of the Fusion Party, was the better option to help in this task. While in Spain, Muñoz Rivera received notice <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> died, which heavily affected him. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he published an article about his father in La Democracia. He subsequently noticed that his travel had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party, which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera, with the two factions becoming known as Muñocistas and Barbosistas.|$|E

5|$|In The History of The Lord of the Rings series Christopher Tolkien {{recorded}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> not foreseen {{the emergence}} of Faramir during {{the writing of the}} book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in The Two Towers. J.R.R.Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela, {{was a local}} {{chief and}} {{councillor}} to the monarch; he {{was appointed to the}} position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House {{and a member of the}} amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 1954, Garcia {{pitched a}} one-hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics in a 6–0 Indians win. Garcia {{called it the}} finest game of his career. He was {{selected}} for his third and final All-Star Game when American League manager Casey Stengel added him, Lemon, and Doby to an American League roster that already featured Avila and top vote-getter Al Rosen. During a late July exhibition game, Garcia learned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> {{died at the age}} of 65; Garcia's son Michael was born the same day. He missed several games that year with a broken blood vessel in his throwing hand, but he managed 45 appearances on the season.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of Warrant Officer during his tenure as a {{prisoner}} of war, Brooks was informed upon his arrival <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> died in May of the previous year. He returned to Canada in June. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during the conflict, as well several other campaign and achievement medals such as the 1967 Canadian Centennial Medal and the silver Polish Cross of Merit with Swords. He was one of only five RCAF members to receive the Military Cross during World War II (as it is primarily granted to soldiers serving in Army units) and his citation was the longest.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> died on 10 March 1826, {{and that he}} had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> {{received}} from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent {{to that of the}} king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1896, Sorabji's {{father was}} back in Bombay, where he played a {{significant}} role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries, among other things. Although he provided his family with financial support, he spent much of his time abroad and on 17 June 1929 bigamously married Nobubai Visvonata Catcar, causing Sorabji and his mother a substantial loss of fortune. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 July 1932. In the same year, Sorabji travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate, but obtained nothing but money from a trust fund <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> established in 1914. Nevertheless, it saved him from having to earn a living, although his lifestyle was ascetic.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} son of HenryIII, Edward was {{involved}} {{early in the}} political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped {{after a few months}} and joined the fight against Simon de Montfort. Montfort was defeated at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and within two years the rebellion was extinguished. With England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. The crusade accomplished little, and Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster on 19August.|$|E
