40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Mathematical models were presented for both the traverse and elevation gun drive systems of a modern main battle tank. The models were based upon the generation of <b>torque,</b> through the <b>gun</b> drive gearboxes, arising from collision engagement of the mating gears, and included a full description of the non-linear effects of both backlash and friction.

5000|$|For a gun firing under free-recoil conditions, {{the force}} on the gun may not only force the gun backwards, but may also cause it to rotate about its center of mass or recoil mount. This is {{particularly}} true of older firearms, such as the classic Kentucky rifle, where the butt stock angles down {{significantly lower than the}} barrel, providing a pivot point about which the muzzle may rise during recoil. Modern firearms, such as the M16 rifle, employ stock designs that are in direct line with the barrel, in order to minimize any rotational effects. If there is an angle for the recoil parts to rotate about, the <b>torque</b> (...) on the <b>gun</b> is given by: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} the development and validation of a three dimensional thermomechanically coupled finite element model for gun drilling AISI 4150 quenched and tempered steel. The Lagrangian formulation proposed in the FE code DEFORM 3 DTM and the constitutive Johnson-Cook material model were utilized to simulate the chip formation and to predict the cutting reaction forces as well as the temperature in gun drilling process using carbide gun drills with two different diameters. During gun drilling simulation, modified gun drill cutting edge rounding and friction law are performed to investigate the effect of tool wear and lubrication on feed force and <b>torque</b> respectively. Experimental <b>gun</b> drilling tests were carried out in steel AISI 4150 for the validation of the developed 3 D FE model. The developed and validated 3 D FE model can be used for optimizing the cutting process in gun drilling (good surface finish and straightness) taking into account the complex gun drill geometry, cutting conditions, heat transfer and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the workpiece material...|$|R
