5|$|Terrestrials: Planets {{that are}} similar to Earth, with bodies largely {{composed}} of rock: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the smallest <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{low mass}} of the planet has led to {{suggestions}} {{that it may be}} a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet.</b> This type of massive <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants.|$|E

50|$|All <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> in the Solar System {{have the}} same basic type of structure, such as a central {{metallic}} core, mostly iron, with a surrounding silicate mantle. The Moon is similar, but has a much smaller iron core. Io and Europa are also satellites that have internal structures {{similar to that of}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets.</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> can have canyons, craters, mountains, volcanoes, and other surface structures, depending on the presence of water and tectonic activity. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> have secondary atmospheres, generated through volcanism or comet impacts, in contrast to the giant planets, whose atmospheres are primary, captured directly from the original solar nebula.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> may be {{detected}} using the gravitational microlensing technique. This was {{demonstrated in the}} high magnification event MACHO- 98 -BLG- 35. Observing strategies aimed at measuring the abundance of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> are discussed, using both existing telescopes and planned telescopes. 1...|$|R
5|$|Though not {{confirmed}} to be a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> and significantly more massive than Earth (at 6.98 Earth masses), the Super-Earth {{is the first}} exoplanet of terrestrial mass proposed to orbit within the habitable zone of its parent star.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we propose}} a Venus {{exploration}} {{program designed to}} explain the origin and divergent evolution of the interiors, surfaces, and atmospheres of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> in our solar system, and provide greater insight into the conditions that may affect the habitability of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> in other solar systems...|$|R
40|$|Four team {{incorporating}} {{scientists and}} engineers from more than 50 universities and 20 engineering f m have assessed techniques for detecting and characterizing <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> orbiting nearby stars. The primary conclusion from the effort {{of the past two}} years is that with suitable technology investment starting now, a mission to detect <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> around 150 nearby stars could be launched within a decade. Missions of smaller scale could carry out more modest programs capable of detecting and characterizing gas giant planets around tens of stars and of detecting <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> around the nearest stars...|$|R
500|$|The inner Solar System, {{the region}} of the Solar System inside 4AU, was too warm for {{volatile}} molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like iron, nickel, and aluminium) and rocky silicates. These rocky bodies would become the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> could not grow very large. The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 Earth masses (...) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> to grow to their present sizes (see <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> below).|$|R
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Planet</b> Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} unknown whether 55 Cancri e {{was a small}} gas giant like Neptune or a large rocky <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet.</b> In 2011, a transit of the planet was confirmed, allowing scientists to calculate its density. At first it was suspected to be a water planet. As initial observations showed no hydrogen in its Lyman-alpha signature during transit, Ehrenreich speculated that its volatile materials might be carbon dioxide instead of water or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and {{the only place where}} life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically {{different from those of the}} other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> in the Solar System.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} extrasolar planet {{searches}} {{has become the}} detection of habitable <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets.</b> Planetary mass and orbit have large and obvious effects on habitability. Since the chemical compositions of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> also {{play an important role}} in habitability, we propose the creation on the observed chemical abundances of stars...|$|R

5|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet known to support life, and its natural {{features}} {{are the subject of}} many fields of scientific research. Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> that {{consists}} of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|The orbital radius {{at which}} the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the {{emission}} matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages {{over a period of}} 20billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4AU. The presence of a large planet with a highly elliptical orbit in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.|$|E
25|$|These {{elements}} constituted only 0.6% of {{the material}} in the solar nebula. That is why the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> could not grow very large and could not exert large pull on hydrogen and helium gas. Also, the faster collisions among particles close to the Sun were more destructive on average. Even if the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> had had hydrogen and helium, the Sun would have heated the gases and caused them to escape. Hence, solar <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are dense small worlds composed mostly from 2% of heavier elements contained in the solar nebula.|$|R

25|$|<b>Terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> are {{substantially}} {{different from the}} giant planets, which might not have solid surfaces and are composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical states. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> have a compact, rocky surfaces, and Venus, Earth, and Mars each also have an atmosphere. Their size, radius, and density are all similar.|$|R
5|$|Simulations {{suggest that}} the inner part of the {{habitable}} zone of 47 Ursae Majoris could host a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> in a stable orbit, though the outer regions of the habitable zone would be disrupted by the gravitational influence of the planet 47 UMa b. However, {{the presence of a}} giant planet within 2.5 AU of the star may have disrupted planet formation in the inner system, and reduced the amount of water delivered to inner planets during accretion. This may mean any terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry. , there have been two METI messages sent to 47 Ursae Majoris. Both were transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar — 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The first message, the Teen Age Message, was sent on September 3, 2001, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in July 2047. The second message, Cosmic Call 2, was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in May 2049.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Mars {{has been an}} issue of {{scientific}} curiosity for centuries, in part because Mars is the only <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet</b> whose surface can be directly observed in detail from the Earth with help from a telescope.|$|E
50|$|The {{last few}} giant impacts during {{planetary}} formation {{tend to be}} the main determiner of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet's</b> rotation rate. During the giant impact stage, the thickness of a protoplanetary disk is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three dimensions. This results in the axial tilt of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both prograde and retrograde spins equally probable. Therefore, prograde spin with small axial tilt, common for the solar system's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> except for Venus, is not common for <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> in general.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} whether extrasolar <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> in general will also follow this trend.|$|R

25|$|The geology {{of solar}} {{terrestrial}} planets mainly {{deals with the}} geological aspects of the four terrestrial planets of the Solar System, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and one terrestrial dwarf planet, Ceres. Only one <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet,</b> Earth, {{is known to have}} an active hydrosphere.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Planet</b> Finder (TPF) was a {{proposed}} project by NASA {{to construct a}} system of space telescopes for detecting extrasolar terrestrial planets. TPF was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2011. There were actually two telescope systems under consideration, the TPF-I, which had several small telescopes, and TPF-C, which used one large telescope.|$|E
25|$|A robotic {{interstellar}} mission carrying some {{number of}} frozen early stage human embryos is another theoretical possibility. This method of space colonization requires, among other things, {{the development of}} an artificial uterus, the prior detection of a habitable <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planet,</b> and advances in the field of fully autonomous mobile robots and educational robots that would replace human parents.|$|E
50|$|A five-planet Nice {{model with}} a late {{instability}} has a low probability of reproducing the orbits of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets.</b> Jupiter's and Saturn's period ratio makes the required jump in {{a small fraction of}} simulations (7%-8.7%) and the eccentricities of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> can also be excited when Jupiter encounters the ice giant. In a study by Nathan Kaib and John Chambers this resulted in the orbits of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> being reproduced in a few percent of simulation with only 1% reproducing both the <b>terrestrial</b> and giant <b>planets</b> orbits. This led Kaib and Chambers to propose that the instability occurred early, before the formation of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets.</b> However, a jump in the ratio of the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn is still required to reproduce the asteroid belt, reducing the advantage of an early instability. A previous study by Ramon Brasser, Kevin Walsh, and David Nesvorny found a reasonable chance (greater than 20%) of reproducing the inner Solar System using a selected five-planet model. The shapes of the impact basins on Iapetus are also consistent with a late bombardment.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{results have}} shown {{that many of the}} known extrasolar {{planetary}} systems contain regions which are stable for both Earth-mass and Saturn-mass planets. Here we simulate the formation of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> in four planetary systems [...] 55 Cancri, HD 38529, HD 37124, and HD 74156 [...] under the assumption that these systems of giant planets are complete and that their orbits are well-determined. Assuming the giant planets formed and migrated quickly, then <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> may form from a second generation of planetesimals. In each case, Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos are placed in between the giant planets and evolved for 100 Myr. We find that planets form relatively easily in 55 Cnc, with masses up to 0. 6 Earth masses and in some cases substantial water contents and orbits in the habitable zone. HD 38529 is likely to support an asteroid belt but no <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> of significant mass. No <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> form in HD 37124 and HD 74156, although in some cases 1 - 2 lone embryos survive for 100 Myr. If migration occurred later, depleting the planetesimal disk, then massive <b>terrestrial</b> <b>planets</b> are unlikely to form in any of these systems.
