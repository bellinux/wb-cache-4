50|$|American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company - This case arose {{out of an}} {{insurance}} policy that The Upper Deck Corporation (“Upper Deck”), purchased from American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company (“AISLIC”). The policy insured a <b>tax</b> <b>strategy</b> that KPMG, an accounting firm, developed for Upper Deck. The IRS investigated the <b>tax</b> <b>strategy</b> and determined that it constituted an improper tax shelter. Upper Deck then settled with the IRS for $80 million in back taxes and interest, and with the California Franchise Tax Board for $17 million in back taxes and interest.|$|E

50|$|Labor {{budgetary}} policy separates aged care from other welfare expenditure. The budget saw synchronised changes across {{the public sector}} as the government decided to lift the pension age and also moved to lift the superannuation preservation age. Two reports which accompanied the budget, the Pension Review Report and the Henry review on <b>tax</b> <b>strategy,</b> argued {{the need for a}} single means test - more comprehensive than testing assets and income separately, standard practice since 1985 - to promote other forms of saving.|$|E
5000|$|Retaining such profits {{offshore}} may {{be regarded}} a <b>tax</b> <b>strategy.</b> Many corporations have accumulated substantial untaxed profits offshore, especially {{in countries with}} low corporate tax rates. In recent years {{it has been estimated}} that untaxed profits range from US$1.6 to $2.1 trillion. The Wall Street Journal noted that the [...] "untaxed foreign earnings are part of a contentious debate over U.S. fiscal policy and tax code." [...] The profits earned abroad and retained there are subject to a foreign exchange risk, besides other financial risks.|$|E
50|$|Seippel also {{is known}} for the 2004 IRS tax shelter {{controversy}} and subsequent case Seippel v. Jenkens & Gilchrist against the Sidley Austin Brown & Wood law firm.

Subsequently, Seippel prepared to file suit against the IRS for attempting to wrongfully impose excessive interest and penalties against him, but the IRS withdrew its action and the suit was never filed.|$|E

40|$|An “invention,” {{as used in}} the United States patent laws, {{refers to}} {{anything}} made by man that employs or harnesses a law of nature or a naturally occurring substance for human benefit. A watermill, for instance, harnesses the power of gravity to run machinery. But legal methods, such as <b>tax</b> <b>strategies,</b> are not inventions in this sense, because they employ “laws of man” — not laws of nature to produce a useful result...|$|R
50|$|In March 2017, when US {{federal agents}} raided Caterpillar's {{headquarters}} in Peoria Ill., {{it was already}} evident that the company engaged in aggressive measures to control tax costs. Since April 2014, the company's tax policies have been investigated by a senate subcommittee headed by Senator Carl Levin. Those investigations uncovered significant changes in Caterpillar's offshore <b>tax</b> <b>strategy,</b> culminating {{in the creation of}} the new Swiss subsidiary Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) in Geneva. In 1999, the former Caterpillar executive Daniel Schlicksup accused the company of funneling profits from replacement parts to Switzerland where it had no warehouses or factories. The Internal Revenue Service found the firm liable for a billion dollars of unpaid taxes for the years 2007 to 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The double Irish {{arrangement}} was a <b>tax</b> <b>strategy</b> that some multinational corporations used {{to lower their}} corporate tax liability. The strategy has ceased to be available since 1 January 2015, though those already engaging in the arrangement have until 2020 to find another arrangement. The strategy used payments between related entities in a corporate structure to move income from a higher-tax country to a lower or no tax jurisdiction. It relies {{on the fact that}} Irish tax law does not include transfer pricing rules as does the United States [...] and those of many other jurisdictions. Specifically, Ireland has territorial taxation, and does not levy taxes on income booked in subsidiaries of Irish companies that are outside the state.|$|E
5000|$|From 1985 to 1995, Troup was a tax {{partner at}} Simmons & Simmons. He joined the Treasury {{as a special}} adviser to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and {{returned}} to Simmons & Simmons as its head of <b>tax</b> <b>strategy</b> after the 1997 general election. Shortly afterwards, Troup wrote a series of Personal View commentaries for the Financial Times, including one titled [...] "Double trouble over tax" [...] on the problems caused because the UK has two separate tax authorities, the Inland Revenue and HM Customs & Excise, and the advantages of merging them. Another piece, Right result, wrong reasons, considering the reasons to abolishing tax credits on dividends. Why the chancellor is missing the point, on the flaws in the tax system {{and the importance of}} the rule of law in taxation, in which he expressed the opinion that [...] "tax avoidance is not a moral issue" [...] and described tax itself as [...] "legalised extortion". [...] Troup's article 15 July 1997 was criticized by Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Given {{the growing}} {{importance}} of intangible assets {{as a source}} of economic growth and tax revenue, as well as the fact that their non-physical nature makes it easier for taxpayers to engage in <b>tax</b> <b>strategies</b> such as income-shifting or transfer pricing, tax authorities and internation organizations have been designing ways to link intangible assets to the place where they were created, hence defining nexus. Intangibles for corporations are amortized over a 15 year period, equivalent to 180 months.|$|R
40|$|Optimal financiai {{strategies}} are criticai for long term survival in competitive international markets.

In the second forthcoming article, we analyze the effect of government restrictions on optimal pricing strategies...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the author}} of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) <b>tax</b> <b>strategy</b> {{implemented}} by Glasgow Rangers FC, which was (in April 2011) challenged by HMRC in a first tier tax tribunal. In November 2012, on a split decision, the Tribunal upheld the legality and tax effectiveness of the EBT strategy. HMRC appealed twice, first to the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Division) which upheld the finding, and then to the Scottish Court of Session which sided with HMRC, declaring that it was [...] "obvious" [...] that [...] "payments to the various trusts and the application of the monies so paid amounted to a mere redirection of earnings which did not remove the liability of employees to income tax". Rangers entered administration on 14 February 2012, and went into liquidation on 31 October 2012. The liquidators of Rangers have been granted leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Session to the UK Supreme Court. Lord Carloway, one of the Court of Sessions judges who ruled on the case, said: [...] "The Court is of the view that there is an arguable point in law of public interest which should allow the appeal to the UK Supreme Court to proceed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Approaching 30 {{years since}} the 1984 {{principals}} of the Worldwide Unitary Tax Working Group, it is questionable {{whether or not a}} competitive balance for U.S. multinationals, foreign multinationals, and purely domestic businesses has been attained. Bloomberg reporter Jesse Drucker demonstrates that separate accounting/arm's length pricing favors the multinationals in an October 2010 article titled [...] "Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Lost to Loopholes" [...] with tax strategies known as the [...] "Double Irish" [...] and the [...] "Dutch Sandwich." [...] In a New York Times October 2012 Dealbook column, Victor Fleischer wrote about [...] "Overseas Cash And The Tax Games Multinationals Play." [...] Although billions in corporate profits are reported to be on the books of foreign subsidiaries located in tax havens, a New York Times article by David Kocieniewski titled [...] "For U.S. Companies, Money Offshore Mean Manhattan" [...] dated May 2013, indicates that those corporate profits are being utilized in the U.S. [...] This is supported by a more recent report by Kitty Richards and John Craig at the Center for American Progress titled [...] "Offshore Corporate Profits - The Only Thing 'Trapped' is Tax Revenue" [...] An article by Floyd Norris in the May 23, 2013 New York Times, [...] "The Corrosive Effect of Apple's Tax Avoidance", points out how these tax avoidance strategies will most likely be followed by many other multinational corporations. [...] And, an article by David Gelles titled [...] "New Corporate Shelter: A Merger Abroad" [...] dated October 8, 2013 makes a case that the best <b>tax</b> <b>strategy</b> for a U.S. based corporation is to become a foreign based corporation.|$|E
5000|$|One by one Sikander kills all. As {{almost all}} {{were part of}} Ahmedabad underworld, the underworld is shaken to its {{foundations}} and the ruthless Sikander, whose main area was only Lal Darwaza, {{becomes more and more}} powerful as he becomes the monopolist of bootlegging in the city. Bootlegging makes Sikander, who was born in a slum in Surat, a rich man living in a luxury flat. Then one day he makes a mistake, he tells Rupali the story of Samson and Delilah, and also tells her that just like Samson's hair, his weak point is his [...]38 revolver, a gift from his guru, a ruthless gangster called Commander, who brought up and trained him. One day Rupali vanishes with the gun and all the money. Sikander almost goes mad. He was so attached to his [...]38 that without it he feels as weak and vulnerable as a baby. His enemies, mainly Chhota Dalvi who is actually behind all mischief Rupali is doing, take advantage of this situation and one by one Sikander starts losing his assets. The government is also trying to trap him just like they trapped Tony Montana in Scarface - by income <b>tax</b> <b>strategy.</b> But Sikander has a simple solution to that - blow up the Income Tax Officer with a bomb ! When the underworld hears that Sikander is planning to blow up an IAS, they strongly suggest him not to do that. A grand meeting is held where all big dons of Gujarat including Firangi, Tony Masalamix and Vijaysingh (based on character of Vijay Mallya) are present to talk to Sikander just like the five [...] "families" [...] do in end of The Godfather, but Sikander has nor level-headedness nor maturity of Don Corleone - he childishly threatens to kill them all by singing a song ...machinegun uthaaya sabko udaaya... as he loses his temper when they question him about the disappearance of one of his subordinates. This way Sikander signs his own death warrant. In the end his own, most trusted lieutenants kill him (under instruction and pressure of the syndicate's general consensus) [...]|$|E

40|$|We {{have already}} seen major {{amendments}} to Australia’s tax regime to tackle base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Several more significant measures were announced in the federal budget, most notably the diverted profits tax, aimed at multinationals which shift tax to a lower taxing jurisdiction. Yet to date, a very simple <b>tax</b> minimisation <b>strategy</b> has been largely ignored in the ongoing reforms and was ignored in the federal budget.
