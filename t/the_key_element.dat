5|$|The Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} the Department of Post-War Reconstruction's proposed principles to govern demobilisation on 12June 1944. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of these principles {{was that the}} order in which personnel would be demobilised was to be based on a points system, with service men and women being allocated points {{on the basis of their}} period of service, age, marital status and employment or training prospects. An extensive demobilisation plan was then developed by an inter-service committee following further consultation with trade unions, employers and returned servicemen. This plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6March 1945. The rate at which personnel were to be discharged was set at 3,000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the Pentropic {{organisation}} was the reorganisation of divisions {{into five}} combined arms battle groups. These battle groups consisted of an infantry battalion, field artillery regiment, engineer field squadron and other combat and logistic elements, including armoured, aviation and armoured personnel carrier units as required. These battle groups would be commanded by {{the commanding officer}} of their infantry battalion and report directly to {{the headquarters of the}} division as brigade headquarters were abolished as part of the reorganisation.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the paro was the {{stoppage}} {{of production}} at the state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which was effected by management's locking workers out of facilities, along with the shipping shutdown. Many low and mid-level employees ignored the strike and reported for work. Unlike the previous strikes, this oil strike included not only the PDVSA management but also substantial parts of its operational staff, including virtually all of its marine flotilla captains. Within days the company was paralyzed.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in operant {{conditioning}} {{and in most}} behavior change programs. It is {{the process by which}} behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior.|$|E
25|$|These new {{projects}} {{were designed to}} make Metro <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the new transport reform plan for the city, Transantiago. Along with the new extensions, exchange stations were designed {{to allow for a}} better interaction between the urban railways and other means of transport, mainly buses. The first exchange station would open in Quinta Normal after the Line 5 extension was finalised on 31 March 2004. However, the original plan to host a railway station would be discarded following the failure of the Melitrén construction.|$|E

25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} Egypt {{depends on a}} complex set of infrastructure along {{the entire length of the}} river. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of this infrastructure is the Aswan High Dam that forms Lake Nasser. The High Dam protects Egypt from floods, stores water for year-round irrigation and produces hydro power. With a live storage capacity of 90 billion cubic the dam stores more than one and a half the average annual flow of the Nile River, thus providing a high level of regulation in the river basin compared to other regulated rivers in the world.|$|E
25|$|Characterisation {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in demarcating {{the choice}} of law and {{jurisdiction}} issues.Once the forum court decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, it must characterise or classify the cause(s) of action. That {{is regarded as the}} most important and difficult problem in conflict of laws as trade and travel between states have become the norm and the effects of broken promises, defective goods, traffic accidents and marital squabbles are no longer confined to the sovereign territory of one particular state or nation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{significant}} that the main target of Tet was the GVN, the party tasked with pacification, the weak link {{in the defense of}} South Vietnam. Contrary to NLF dogma and expectations, the hoped for uprising of the masses never occurred. The South Vietnamese did not embrace the cause, and many ARVN units stood firm and fought back. Nevertheless, Tet demonstrates how Communist strategy was focused on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in a People's War- the population – whether to control it or demoralize it, while American strategy focused on kill ratios and attrition.|$|E

Traditionally, sheep grazing has been <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in agriculture on the Island, however in recent times, more diverse crops, such as potatoes and canola have been introduced. Cattle farming has grown as well, with good quality beef cattle being {{grown in the}} higher rainfall areas. Tourism and fishing also play significant roles, with the island experiencing over 186,000 visitors per annum, {{and some of the}} best southern rock lobster being sourced from the island's rugged south coast. Kangaroo Island has South Australia's only eucalyptus oil distillery with oil distilled from the endemic Kangaroo Island narrow leaf mallee.|$|E
25|$|In {{empirical}} formulas, these proportions {{begin with}} a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element.</b> For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of ethanol may be written C2H6O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is boron carbide, whose formula of CBn is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.|$|E
25|$|Chie Shinohara {{wrote the}} manga series Red River (also known as Anatolia Story), about a fifteen-year-old Japanese girl named Yuri Suzuki, who is magically transported to Hattusa, {{the capital of}} the Hittite Empire in Anatolia. She was summoned by Queen Nakia who means to use Yuri as a human sacrifice. Yuri's blood is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> needed in placing a curse upon the princes of the land so that they will perish, leaving Nakia's son as the sole heir to the throne. As the story progresses, however, Yuri not only {{repeatedly}} manages to escape Nakia's scheming, she also becomes revered as an incarnation of the goddess Ishtar and falls in love with prince Kail. Mursili II is portrayed as Prince Kail.|$|E

25|$|The carnyx's most {{prominent}} {{feature is the}} bell, which was constructed as an animal head, either {{as one of a}} serpent, a fish, a bird, a wolf, a horse, an ass or a wild boar. The earliest depiction shows the head of a dragon and was found on Aetolian victory coins from the 3rd century BC, which commemorate the expulsion of the Gallic warriors, who had marauded the Delphi sanctum. Behn (1912) interpreted the many bell types as distinguishing features of the various Celtic clans and chiefdoms. Others have suggested a mythological component, which is the most logical explanation, since the Deskford Carnyx in Scotland was a sacrificial offering, of which the possibly dismantled head could have been <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element.</b> Based on this independent development of the bell an attempt was made to derive the Etruscan lituus from the carnyx, but without success.|$|E
25|$|Pachelbel wrote {{more than}} one hundred fugues on free themes. These fall into two categories: some 30 free fugues and around 90 of the {{so-called}} Magnificat Fugues. His fugues are usually based on non-thematic material, and are shorter than the later model (of which those of J.S. Bach are a prime example). The contrapuntal devices of stretto, diminution and inversion are very rarely employed in any of them. Nevertheless, Pachelbel's fugues display a tendency towards a more unified, subject-dependent structure which was to become <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of late Baroque fugues. Given the number of fugues he composed and the extraordinary variety of subjects he used, Pachelbel is {{regarded as one of the}} key composers in the evolution of the form. He was also the first major composer to pair a fugue with a preludial movement (a toccata or a prelude)– this technique was adopted by later composers and was used extensively by J.S. Bach.|$|E
25|$|The Clippers, however, nearly {{moved to}} Anaheim {{permanently}} {{in time for}} the 1996–97 season, but according to a Los Angeles Times article published in June 1996, owner Donald Sterling turned down a deal that would have paid the team $95 million over 12 years. Odgen Corporation, who at the time managed the Pond, and the city of Anaheim offered the Clippers a multi-tiered deal that would have included upwards of $33 million paid to the team over the first six years of their Pond agreement, plus other monies allocated towards new locker rooms, team offices, and a practice facility. In another related Times article, Odgen and Sterling were in talks to have the management company take care of the Clippers' day-to-day operations for a $4 million a year fee. Also at the time, the Walt Disney Company, owners of the Ducks and Anaheim Angels baseball team during that period, were pursuing at least a partial ownership of the Clippers, with <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> being that its game telecasts would be part of a planned ESPN regional network for Southern California. However, as the planned ESPN West network never came to reality, all three teams had continued to maintain broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket.|$|E

500|$|Naughty Dog {{consciously}} avoided action game stereotypes, including super-powered {{heroes and}} overly sexualized female characters.

Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly think that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>element,</b> {{if you really want to}} boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|E
500|$|The Cat and the Canary is {{the product}} of early 20th century German expressionism. According to art {{historian}} Joan Weinstein, expressionism includes the art styles of Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter, cubism, futurism, and abstraction. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> that connects these styles is the concern for the expression of inner feelings over verisimilitude to nature. Film historian Richard Peterson notes that [...] "German cinema became famous for stories of psychological horror and for uncanny moods generated through lighting, set design and camera angles." [...] Such filmmaking techniques drew on expressionist themes. Influential examples of German expressionist film include Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) about a deranged doctor and Paul Leni's Waxworks (1925) about a wax figure display at a fair.|$|E
