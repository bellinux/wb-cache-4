She also explained that the theme of {{the song was}} freedom, saying that the song's lyric [...] "Remember who you really are" [...] was [...] "exactly everything you could assume it means". Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, [...] "That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to this thing and living <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And I do love it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer's self-titled debut album, {{also known}} as the Blue album, was {{released}} in May 1994 and became a commercial success; it was certified gold on December 1 and platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not sure this is <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, he listened to the operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E
500|$|Feller {{was born}} and raised with his sister, Marguerite, in Van Meter, Iowa. His father, William, ran the [...] family farm, and his mother, Lena (Forret), was a teacher and {{registered}} nurse. Feller played catch daily with his father. He had learned to throw a curveball {{by the time he was}} eight years old, and could throw a ball [...] when he was nine. To assist his son, Feller senior started growing wheat on his farm, a less labor-intensive crop than corn, to allow his son more time to play baseball. Originally the Fellers were Roman Catholics but converted to Methodism after Feller's father was reprimanded by their parish priest for letting him play on Sundays. Feller later suggested that his arm strength and ball speed during his major league career came from his childhood work milking cows, picking corn, and baling hay. He recalled his childhood fondly: [...] "What kid wouldn't enjoy <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> led in Iowa? Baseball and farming, and I had the best of both worlds." [...] The family's farm is on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

500|$|In April 1930 Gielgud {{finished}} the season playing Hamlet. Williams's production used the complete {{text of the}} play. This {{was regarded as a}} radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. Sybil Thorndike said, [...] "I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams... I've had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far more real than <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> live in, and moved, moved beyond words." [...] The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers. Demand was so great that the cast moved to the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened. The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence. Gielgud's Hamlet was richly praised by the critics. Ivor Brown called it [...] "a tremendous performance... the best Hamlet of [...] experience." [...] James Agate wrote, [...] "I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water-mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time." ...|$|E

I'm just triple beam, dreamin / niggaz be, schemin". Writing for The Michigan Daily, Andrew Kahn noted the [...] "old-school, pre-fame hunger" [...] present in [...] "Hustler's Ambition" [...] due {{to the use of the}} [...] "I Need You" [...] sample.

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{alleged that}} Jackson showed pornography to children at Neverland, including the accuser and his brother. [...] The raids on Neverland produced {{an accumulation of}} ten years' worth of heterosexual adult magazines such as Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler along with various heterosexual pornographic videos and websites on his computer. The prosecution alleged these were used for grooming young victims. [...] Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, two {{men who had been}} friends with Jackson since childhood, testified that they had not been [...] "aware that [...] possessed sexually explicit material" [...] until the trial. There were also a few books seized (from a library of thousands) that the prosecution suggested were evidence of homosexuality and/or pedophilia. [...] Boys Will Be Boys included pictures of boys, many naked, in various non-sexual activities such as climbing a tree or sitting on a bench. The book had an inscription reading, [...] "To Michael: From your fan. Love XXXOOO Rhonda – 1983, Chicago." [...] Wade Robson testified he considered Boys Will Be Boys [...] "not a pornographic book," [...] and said he would not be concerned about its owner being in the same bed with a 12-year-old. Another book, The Boy: A Photographic Essay, was inscribed, [...] "Look at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys' faces. This is the spirit of boyhood, a life I never had and will always dream of. This is <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> want for my children. MJ." [...] The book contained pictures of boys in various situations by different photographers, including pictures taken during the filming of the 1963 Lord of the Flies film and showed the boys on the set, usually clothed but sometimes nude, playing in the sand, reading comic books, and having pillow fights. The only book depicting male sex acts was a rare, out-of-print book called A Sexual Study of Man which featured many images of adult men engaged in all kinds of homosexual intercourse. [...] Robson said he would be concerned if the book's owner were to share his bed with a boy, but amended that he would not mind if he considered the total picture of all the material in question. [...] Robson testified that he believed Jackson had a [...] "sexual interest in women," [...] and that he had never seen [...] "anything that suggested pedophilia" [...] at Neverland. [...] Jackson's multiple residences were searched numerous times by various agencies over a period of days, without any child pornography ever being found. The FBI analyzed sixteen computers and found [...] "nothing notable" [...] contained in their files.|$|E
