5|$|Several {{organizations}} {{have attempted to}} measure Clinton's place on <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journals 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative. National Journals subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.|$|E

5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E

5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian. However, the different {{cultural and political}} views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous aspects of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E
5|$|The Almanac of American Politics rates congressional votes {{as liberal}} or {{conservative}} on <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Kennedy's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 91 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative, the social rating was 89 percent liberal and 5 percent conservative, {{and the foreign}} rating was 96 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative.|$|E
5|$|The term is controversial, and its precise {{meaning is}} hard to define. Some {{minority}} students are discouraged from achieving in school by the negative prejudices of ethnic peers; such a view has been expressed in articles in The New York Times, Time magazine, and The Wall Street Journal—and by public figures and academics across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E

5|$|Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did {{not share}} a united {{political}} view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral. This stance was adopted to ensure the magazine did not fall afoul of the colonial government's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government. However, writings falling under various parts <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> were published, including works by cultural nationalists, a sonnet dedicated to Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg, and notes on fascism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious {{for the number of}} its death sentences.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E

He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh.|$|E
5|$|Harriet Tubman, {{widely known}} and well-respected {{while she was}} alive, became an American icon {{in the years after}} she died.

5|$|In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi {{imposed a}} state of emergency.

In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held. The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> including the Socialist Party, the Congress (O) and the Bharatiya Lok Dal to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} an IRA assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was widely supported across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment {{as well as her}} monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E

5|$|While it {{received}} little {{attention from the}} mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-racist organization that especially covers anti-Semitism, publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games. They lobbied the Interactive Digital Software Association to encourage its members to adopt such policies.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
