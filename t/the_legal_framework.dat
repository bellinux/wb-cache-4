5|$|Prior to the 1938 season, the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the second-tier senior {{football}} {{competition in}} the state, made an ambitious break from tradition in what was ultimately a successful ploy to improve its popularity: it legalised throwing the ball in general play and made a few other rule changes to create a distinct and faster variation of Australian rules football, and ended <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> which required players to obtain a clearance when switching from the VFL to the VFA (or vice versa). On March 31, Nash caused a sensation when {{he became the first}} VFL player to defect under this schism, transferring from South Melbourne to Camberwell without a clearance. Nash was already one of the highest paid players in the VFL, but accepted an offer of £8/week to captain-coach the Camberwell Football Club, £3/week to captain-coach the sub-district Camberwell Cricket Club and a job as a Camberwell Council official.|$|E

40|$|Introduction This article {{questions}} {{the ability of}} current market frameworks to instigate large-scale, long-term systemic change to generation and network patterns in Australia. Systemic change will need {{to take account of}} <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> of <b>the</b> National Electricity Market (‘NEM’) – a market purposefully designed to deliver electricity to Australian households and industry in an economically efficient and reliable way. Not only is the current market framework in Australia perpetuating carbon-intensive patterns of electricity generation, its <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> are designed and embedded {{in a way that makes}} change cumbersome and difficult to achieve. This article will not only set out how <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> of <b>the</b> NEM can hinder systemic change, but will draw on a comparative case study example – the German electricity market reform experience – to flag the breadth and depth of market reform necessary for the transition to renewable energy...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the debt management problem in Zimbabwe. Like any other country Zimbabwe has a Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> that touches on debt management. The major issue at hand is why Zimbabwe is failing to sustain its external debt stock whilst it has a Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> that focuses on debt management. The study hypothesized that inadequacy of <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> has led to unsustainable debt. The research utilized purposive and snowball sampling in selecting the key respondents. Data was gathered through document study, questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires were administered to key respondents {{and in some cases}} interviews were concurrently held. Though <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> provide for <b>the</b> institutional set up to undertake debt management and provide for the legality of loan contraction, the research revealed that <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> are inadequate in other matters relating to debt management. Research findings demonstrated that <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> do not specify the loan contraction process, void on external borrowing ceiling and does not clearly provide for the circumstances under which borrowing is permissible and makes loan contraction exclusive. It is in light of these lacunas that the recommendations were premised on. The study promotes the strengthening of Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> relating to debt management...|$|R
