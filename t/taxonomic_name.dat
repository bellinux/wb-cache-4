Various other unofficial trivial names are common pike, great {{northern pike}}, Lakes pike, snot rocket, slough shark, snake, slimer, slough snake, northern, gator (due to a head similar in shape to that of an alligator), jack, jackfish, hammer handle, and other such names as long head and pointy nose.

25|$|Several {{important}} finds have propelled Ethiopia and {{the surrounding}} region to the forefront ofpalaeontology. The oldest hominid discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2 million year old Ardipithicus ramidus (Ardi) found by Tim D. White in 1994. The most well known hominid discovery is Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy). Known locally as Dinkinesh, the specimen {{was found in the}} Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Region in 1974 by Donald Johanson, {{and is one of the}} most complete and best preserved adult Australopithecine fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's <b>taxonomic</b> <b>name</b> refers to the region where the discovery was made. The hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} E. annectens predates both Edmontosaurus and annectens. The first good specimen, the former holotype (specimen {{on which a}} <b>taxonomic</b> <b>name</b> is based) of Anatosaurus copei (Anatotitan), was a {{complete}} skull and most of a skeleton collected in 1882 by Dr. J. L. Wortman and R. S. Hill for American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. This specimen, found in Hell Creek Formation rocks, came from northeast of the Black Hills of South Dakota and originally had extensive skin impressions. It was missing most of the pelvis {{and part of the}} torso due to a stream cutting through it. The bill had impressions of a horny sheath with a tooth-like series of interlocking points on the upper and lower jaws. When describing this specimen AMNH5730, Cope assigned it to the species Diclonius mirabilis. This species name was created by combining Diclonius, a hadrosaurid genus Cope had named earlier from teeth, with Trachodon mirabilis, an older name based on teeth and published by Joseph Leidy. Cope believed that Leidy had failed to properly characterize the genus Trachodon and later abandoned its use, so he assigned the old species to his newer genus. Leidy had come to recognize that his Trachodon was based on the remains of multiple kinds of dinosaurs, and though he had made some attempts to revise the genus, he had not yet made any formal declaration of his intentions.|$|E

500|$|The <b>taxonomic</b> <b>name</b> Strepsirrhini {{derives from}} the Greek στρεψίς (strepsis or [...] "a turning [...] )" [...] and ῥινός (rhinos or [...] "nose"), which refers to the {{appearance}} of the sinuous (comma-shaped) nostrils on the rhinarium or wet nose. The name was first used by French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1812 as a subordinal rank comparable to Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (Old World monkeys). In his description, he mentioned [...] "Les narines terminales et sinueuses" [...] ("Nostrils terminal and winding").|$|E
500|$|The taxon Dinosauria was {{formally}} named in 1842 by paleontologist Sir Richard Owen, who {{used it to}} refer to the [...] "distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles" [...] that were then being recognized in England and around the world.
