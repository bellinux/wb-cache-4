5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam {{and take them}} <b>to</b> <b>places</b> of safety. A captive named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for a male, and 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E

5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted <b>to</b> <b>places</b> {{where there is}} no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme is {{situated}} near the A34 Cheadle bypass, {{as well as}} international transport link Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the United Kingdom outside London. The A5419 and B5095 roads traverse Cheadle Hulme; there are many buses that operate {{on a daily basis}} throughout the area, with frequent services to and from Stockport bus station, passing through neighbouring towns and villages. There are also services to Manchester Piccadilly Gardens, as well as <b>to</b> <b>places</b> such as Woodford, Macclesfield, Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport.

5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given <b>to</b> <b>places</b> around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E

30|$|When {{applying}} GMM {{to objects}} of orthodontic interest, such as bone and soft tissue surfaces, palates, or teeth, we cannot study curves and surfaces directly {{but we need}} <b>to</b> <b>place</b> landmarks on them. Thus, the most challenging problems are how many landmarks <b>to</b> <b>place,</b> which criteria (anatomical? geometrical?) <b>to</b> use <b>to</b> <b>place</b> landmarks, how densely should we cover each surface, and finally how can we ascertain that landmarks are homologous from one object to the other.|$|R
5|$|During the war the LPO {{played in}} the capital and on continual tours of Britain, under Sargent and other conductors, {{bringing}} orchestral concerts <b>to</b> <b>places</b> where they had rarely if ever been given. Many of the players' instruments were lost when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941; an appeal was broadcast by the BBC, the response to which was enormous, with instruments donated by the public enabling the orchestra to continue.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber <b>to</b> <b>places</b> where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E

The Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium claws {{and begins to}} extract Logan's healing abilities, {{revealing}} himself to be Ichirō, who had faked his death. Ichirō regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichirō with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone claws and kills Ichirō. Logan collapses and has one final hallucination of Jean, in which he decides to finally let go of her. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan {{as he prepares to}} leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart <b>to</b> <b>places</b> unknown.|$|E

5|$|The church survived {{until the}} 11th century, {{when it was}} abandoned. Thereafter it was liberally plundered for sculptures and other {{architectural}} elements (spolia) by both the Byzantines and, after the sack {{of the city in}} 1204, by the Crusaders. Several pieces from St. Polyeuctus were reused in the Monastery of Christ Pantokrator (the modern Zeyrek Mosque), and various pieces such as capitals were spread <b>to</b> <b>places</b> as far as Venice, Barcelona and Vienna, including the so-called Pilastri Acritani ("Pillars of Acre") in St Mark's Basilica, Venice.|$|E

When the green and golden bell frog was found there, the tennis courts were built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced <b>to</b> <b>places</b> in Sydney in its natural habitat, without much success.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers <b>to</b> <b>places</b> where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling <b>to</b> <b>places</b> such as Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other Moorish {{remnants}} are still visible in Gibraltar today. A hamam or bath-house, similar to examples in Fez in Morocco, {{was built in the}} lower town; its remnants can still be seen today incorporated into the Gibraltar Museum. It was built using Roman and Visigothic capitals, perhaps salvaged from the nearby ruined city of Carteia. The bath-house may {{have been part of the}} Moorish governor's house. A mosque was built in the city centre and was later converted by the Spanish into a Catholic church (now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned). A small mosque was built near Europa Point at the southern tip of Gibraltar and was later converted into the Christian Shrine of Our Lady of Europe. A subterranean reservoir, now known as the Nun's Well, was also built at Europa Point for the supply of water to the city. An existing 12th-century wall along the sea shore was extended to Europa Point to block access <b>to</b> <b>places</b> where landings could be made by sea. Much of the remainder of Moorish Gibraltar was obliterated by the destruction caused by the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1779–83 and is now buried below the strengthened fortifications and rebuilding implemented by the British afterwards.|$|E

But with that growth have come greater complexity and diversity in thinking and mounting confusion about the ontological and epistemological assumptions underlying any spe-cific investigation. Beckley et al.

While our thinking has benefited from their contributions <b>to</b> <b>place</b> research, we see an increasing need to clarify the multiple and competing paths for place research easily obscured in the heap of similar-sounding place concepts. Our commentary cautions against philosophically unguided methodological experimen-tation and offers some critique of their conceptual approach <b>to</b> <b>place...</b>|$|R
