40|$|The gas {{evaporating}} {{from the}} Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), usually called Boil-off Gas (BOG), {{has previously been}} out of focus regarding its composition and corresponding heating value. A concentration of the BOG has been assumed to be identical to the loaded LNG, or has been given by another constant value, as the gas has been something to the carrier has &# 147;to get rid off&# 148;. However, these assumptions have seemed to give deviating results in reported fuel consumption for the vessel in some cases. This master thesis is therefore investigating the difference in concentration of the BOG evaporating from the transported LNG during voyage, and corresponding deviations in reported fuel consumption by assumed characteristics of the BOG. To do this, a dynamic model is developed to see the change in concentration of the BOG per day of the voyage by a given loaded LNG quality. By knowing the change in concentration of the BOG, the model calculates the corresponding change in Higher Heating Value (HHV), since the BOG is used as fuel for the vessel. Any changes in concentration of the LNG during the loading process is taken into account as well, as it will influence the initial concentration of the product at {{the first day of}} the voyage. To report the total fuel consumption for an LNG Carrier (LNG/C), a Fuel Oil Equivalent (FOE) is used <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>amount</b> LNG to tons of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This equivalent depends on the HHVs of both the BOG and the HFO, which is also calculated by the dynamic model. Since it has been a normal procedure for a ship owner to assume a value for this FOE, the last part of the master thesis looks into deviations in reported fuel consumption by different assumptions, and corresponding economical consequences. The results from the model showed a significant increase in fraction of nitrogen in the BOG by only a small increase of nitrogen in the transported LNG. Since nitrogen is highly volatile at the given cargo temperature of - 162 &# 176;C, the LNG tended to contain a lower fraction of nitrogen when finally loaded. The difference in concentration of the BOG during voyage caused a lower HHV compared to the LNG, as the fraction of nitrogen in the BOG was higher. This affected the calculated FOE of the BOG, and caused significant deviations in reported fuel consumption when utilizing common ways to assume the FOE. By having a HFO price of 600 USD/ton, this led to an unnecessary cost of 366, 000 USD for one voyage of 28 days, when transporting LNG with approximately 1 Mole% nitrogen. </p...|$|E

40|$|Extract: It is not {{uncommon}} to hear or read statements that suggest that people in some countries are living on just a couple dollars a day. 2 ̆ 2 How can they survive? 2 ̆ 2 we ask ourselves. The answer is that price levels are different between countries, and that is very much the case between wealthy industrialized nations and poorer developing countries. If one earns five local dollars a day and it costs only two to live, then survival at least is possible. The inconsistency lies in the use of money market exchange rates <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>amounts</b> of money <b>to</b> the same currency and thus compare incomes and the price of goods in one currency with those in another. Comparing national economies via measures such as gross domestic product (GDP) using exchange rates to bring amounts expressed in various local currencies to a common base currency produces a view of relative wealth that can be very much distorted by price-level differences between countries...|$|R

50|$|Most {{often of}} all, the {{reduction}} of iodine to iodide is the last step {{in a series of}} reactions where the initial reactions are used <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> an unknown <b>amount</b> of the solute (the substance being analyzed) to an equivalent amount of iodine, which may then be titrated. Sometimes other halogens (or haloalkanes) than iodine are used in the intermediate reactions because they are available in better measurable standard solutions and/or react more readily with the solute.

40|$|Campania {{region is}} {{undergoing}} a new and important land use change (LUC). Large areas under tobacco are experiencing a severe economic crisis and cereal areas, especially in the hill, are cultivated with increasing difficulty, with poor economic results (yield value of 2. 5 t/ha/year) and under the risk of erosion. No-food crops suitable in these contexts are the perennial and in this case, the land use change would certainly lead to {{a positive impact on}} reducing erosion, but also on the reduction of nutrient requirement, on fuel consumption and perhaps it would also lead to an increase in profitability. The aim of this work is to identify the areas in which the land use change could be realistic and ecologically compatible and to evaluate the main consequence of the LUC. The study area includes the entire Campania region. It has been assumed that the areas that will undergo the LUC will be the hilly, not-irrigated cereal crop, with altitudes between 400 and 750 m a. s. l., not included in natural parks, in the Site of Community Importance and in the Special Protection Areas. Through the climate model, inferred from the Ground Water Protection Plan, the area to be examined was classified as ‘cold Lauretum’, which is a good area for the Arundo donax crops up to 750 m a. l. s., with recoverable biomass yield of about 12. 6 t/year. The erosion has been estimated with RUSLE applied to the whole region. Using the ESRI ArcGis 10. 0 software, seven large areas, partially convertible, were identified. The area that is realistic <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> approximately 500 km 2. The value of the biomass production has been evaluated in the order of 25 million euro a year; actual wheat production would be 33 million euro a year but the production costs are far greater.

30|$|As stated above, {{the most}} {{accurate}} way of calculating emissions from freight transport operations is to record fuel consumption and to employ standard emission factors <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> the <b>amount</b> of combusted fuel into CO 2. When energy values are not available—for instance, when planning or evaluating future/alternative transport scenarios—fuel consumption models may be used, which estimate fuel consumption of transport operations based {{on a variety of}} vehicle-, environment-, and traffic-related parameters, such as vehicle speed, load factors, road gradients, and acceleration [3, 4, 34]. This research adopts the fuel consumption model ‘COPERT 4,’ as described by the European Environment Agency (EEA) [32]. COPERT has been chosen because it is a European-wide accepted methodology to calculate fuel consumption and GHG emissions from road freight transport. It integrates methods and results from other accepted scientific projects (e.g., ARTEMIS, COST 319, HBEFA, and MEET), and the methodology proposed by COPERT is used in other emission models [4, 8, 35]. Furthermore, COPERT has been widely used in different studies and proved its adequacy in research on green road freight transportation [4, 35].|$|R

Biofuel cells {{are a subset}} of fuel cells that employ biocatalysts such as a microbe, enzyme or even organelle interacting with an electrode surface [34, 35].

Microbial fuel cells employ living cells to catalyze the oxidation of the fuel, whereas enzymatic fuel cells use enzymes for this purpose [36]. These types of catalysts offer great benefits in catalytic activity, specificity and cost. However, development and full evaluation of these dynamic and often sensitive bioelectrochemical systems require a diverse range of expertise [33]. Biofuel cells like other ones require porous anode and cathode structures that support fuel transport to the catalyst reaction sites [36]. Either a polymer electrolyte membrane or a salt bridge can separate the electrodes. The two main application areas that are being considered for enzymatic biofuel cells are in vivo, implantable power supplies for sensors and pacemakers and ex-vivo power supplies for small portable power devices (wireless sensor networks, portable electronics, etc.) [33].|$|R

To evaluate the contribution of N 2 fixation to the nitrogen (N) economy in this alder stand, we also measured the phenology of the alder, the litterfall, the decomposition rate of the leaf litter, and N accumulation in the soil. The acetylene reduction activity per unit nodule mass (ARA) under field conditions appeared after bud break, peaked the maximum in midsummer after full expansion of the leaves, and disappeared after all leaves had fallen. There was no consistent correlation between ARA and tree size (dbh).
