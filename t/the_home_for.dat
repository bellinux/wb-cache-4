According to the predictions 30 % of the population in Slovenia will be older than 65 years by the year 2060. This raises the questions of how to define the lifestyle of the elderly, and how can the latter influence be influenced. The decision of some elderly people to spend their old age in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly can be contributed to a multitude of reasons. The paper presents the results of the research on the lifestyle of <b>the</b> elderly in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly.

George Washington occupied the house as his headquarters, beginning July 16, 1775. It served as his base of operations during the Siege of Boston, until he moved out on April 4, 1776. Andrew Craigie, Washington's Apothecary General, was the next person to own <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> a significant period of time. After purchasing the house in 1791, he instigated the home's only major addition. Craigie's financial situation at the time of his death in 1819 forced his widow Elizabeth Craigie to take in boarders. It was as a boarder that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow came into the home. He became its owner in 1843, when his father-in-law Nathan Appleton purchased it as a wedding gift. He lived in the home until his death in 1882.|$|E

40|$|A {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is "Leisure activities in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly {{in the city}} compared with the village". A theoretical part of the bachelor thesis {{is divided into three}} circuits, in the first one there are explained conceptions of an old age, ageing process and changes associated with it. The second circuit is devoted to a leisure time of the elderly and an introduction of possible activities. Last, but not least, there is mentioned a social work with seniors. A practical part is focused on achieving the defined objectives. The fist goal was to compare leisure activities in chosen <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in cities and villages {{with the help of a}} secondary data analysis. Activity plans and their websites underwent the secondary data analysis in <b>the</b> chosen <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly. The second goal was to find out seniors´ satisfaction with provided leisure time activities. The satisfaction was measured through a questionnaire. The research showed that the seniors are satisfied with the leisure activities in all <b>the</b> chosen <b>homes</b> both in <b>the</b> cities and in the villages. Following hypotheses were established before an implementation of the research: Hypothesis No. 1 : Leisure activities in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in cities are comparable with leisure activities in <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in the villages. This hypothesis was confirmed by the research. In all selected <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly there is an emphasis on leisure activities, all <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly hold similar (comparable) leisure activities for their clients. Hypothesis No. 2 : There are no differences between an organization of leisure activities in <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in cities and villages, was not confirmed. The secondary analysis revealed that <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in the cities have more employees engaged in the leisure activities. Therefore they can devote more attention to immobile clients. Additionally there still come volunteers to those homes, who individually attend to the single clients of <b>the</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>The</b> thesis can be used by both by professionals and the general public to obtain information about leisure activities in <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in the cities and villages and a possibility to assess any differences in an offer of the leisure time activities...|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} six {{official}} residences of Indiana's governors since Indiana became a state, but only five were actually inhabited {{by the first}} family. There were four other unofficial residences that governors also lived in while no other accommodations were available. The first residence of a state governor was in Corydon on a small hill overlooking the first statehouse; Governor Jonathan Jennings and his wife Anne lived in it from 1816 until 1822. The home was visited by United States Presidents Andrew Jackson and James Monroe. The building is no longer standing but a new home has been built upon its original foundation and uses its cellar as a basement. Governor William Hendricks also lived in Corydon at Governor Hendricks Headquarters, an unofficial residence purchased by Hendricks from Davis Floyd and located on the same block as Jennings' home. Floyd had built <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> himself, but lost it after the Panic of 1819. Hendricks lived there during his term as governor, from 18221825, and later sold it.|$|E
