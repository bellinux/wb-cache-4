40|$|Interface {{engineering}} {{is an important}} aspect {{for the improvement of}} perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The hole transport layer with good interface contact, transport capability, and matched energy level is indispensable and critical for high-performance photovoltaic devices. Herein, anode interface engineering with an excellent compatible bilayer of poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfo-nate) /poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS/PEDOT) doped with grafted sulfonated-acetone-formaldehyde lignin (PEDOT:GSL) via a low-temperature and water-soluble process is presented. As a water-processable interface material, PEDOT:GSL exhibits higher conductivity, as well as better structural and electronic homogeneities compared with PEDTO:PSS. Consequently, the PEDOT:PSS/PEDOT:GSL bilayer with <b>tuned</b> <b>energy</b> level, optical properties, and the combination of the trap passivation of GSL at the anode/perovskite interface can greatly improve charge extraction ability and reduce the interface recombination. Simultaneously, the homogeneous perovskite film is fabricated through optimizing the annealing process. The device with the power conversion efficiency up to 17. 80 % is achieved, with 32. 6 % improvement compared to PEDOT:PSS-only device (13. 42 %). Our success to achieve high-performance inverted PVSCs provides new understanding of PEDOT:PSS, and also new guidelines for anode interface engineering to further advancement of PVSCs. This promising approach paves the way to realize solution processable highly efficient PVSCs for potential practical applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} multiwavelength temporal and spectral {{analysis of the}} `fast rise exponential decay' GRB 070419 A. The early-time emission in the γ-ray and X-ray bands {{can be explained by}} a central engine active for at least 250 s, while at late times the X-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. In contrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 102 up to 106 s). We investigate the light-curve behaviour {{in the context of the}} standard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical light curve at ~ 450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a Lorenz factor Γ ~ 350 at this time. In contrast, the shallow optical decay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shock component whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peak time for it to be explained within the standard model. This predicts an increasing flux density for the forward shock component until t ~ 4 × 106 s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emission from t ~ 104 s. A highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due to unrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light-curve behaviour that is not observed. We conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely <b>tuned</b> <b>energy</b> injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required to create the observed light curves, consistent with the same conditions that are invoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical X-ray light curves of γ-ray bursts...|$|E

40|$|Recently, halide {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} have {{attracted much attention}} due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost. Their efficiency has been sharply improved from 3. 8 % to 22. 1 % {{in the last six}} years, making them as the promising next generation solar cells. However, the halide perovskite solar cells are facing several serious problems, such as request of further improvement efficiency and the lead pollution. These problems hinder the future commercialization of halide perovskite solar cells. How to solve these problems is still a challenge. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells is strongly affected by the quality of perovskite films, such as the crystallization and coverage, while the lead pollution is attributed to the halide perovskite absorbing materials. Therefore, this thesis mainly focuses on the morphology control of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to fabricate high-quality perovskite films with good crystallization and full coverage to improve the efficiency. We also design and synthesize new lead-free absorbing materials to avoid the lead pollution. In Chapter 1, the background of solar energy and photovoltaic technologies has been introduced. Furthermore, the recent challenges for the halide perovskite solar cells and the purpose of this thesis have been described. In Chapter 2, the experimental procedures, including general preparation and characterization of perovskite materials and electrodes, as well as devices used in this thesis have been summarized. In Chapter 3, a new method of concentration gradient controlled growth has been developed to prepare high-quality CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite films under ambient conditions. The two-step reactions were used with the concentration gradient of CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) solutions, yielding the perovskite films with different crystallization and surface morphologies. In details, the first-step reaction between a low concentration MAI solution and the PbI 2 films resulted in the formation of large-scale perovskite grains, and in the second-step reaction with a high concentration MAI solution we achieved a full coverage of the perovskite films. The large grain sizes of ca. 1. 5 μm in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite films were obtained using the concentration gradient method, which means that the grain boundaries can be reduced. Meanwhile, spectral absorption in the short- wavelength region was enhanced in the concentration-gradient controlled perovskite films due to light scattering, which is considered to benefit the power conversion of solar cells. The perovskite solar cells fabricated using the concentration gradient controlled method showed higher photovoltaic performance than that by the traditional single solution method. In Chapter 4, the Pb-free composites of bismuth triiodide (BiI 3) and layered perovskite (CH 3 NH 3) 3 Bi 2 I 9 (MBI) have been prepared by a simple solution method for thin film solar cells. It was found that the introduction of MBI significantly enhanced the crystallization and coverage of BiI 3, meanwhile there was a multi-absorption phenomenon in the composite films. In addition, the band bending occurred at the BiI 3 -MBI interfaces, accompanying with the <b>tuned</b> <b>energy</b> levels in the composite films. The band bending was considered to benefit the efficient injection of excited electrons from absorbing layers into the electron transport layers. When 10 - 20 % of MBI were used, the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) were improved in the composite solar cells. An enhancement of 65 % of the PCE was achieved in the (BiI 3) 0. 8 (MBI) 0. 2 solar cells due to the multi-effects of the composite active layers. In Chapter 5, the Pb-free double perovskites La 2 NiMnO 6 have been studied for potential application on solar cells. The rhombohedral and the monoclinic La 2 NiMnO 6 were respectively formed under different conditions. The monoclinic La 2 NiMnO 6 had an experimental bandgap (Eg) of 1. 4 eV and valence band (VB) of - 5. 8 eV. Whereas, the rhombohedral La 2 NiMnO 6 had an experimental Eg of 1. 2 eV and VB of - 5. 7 eV. Both of them are suitable as visible light absorbers. Furthermore, the density function theory calculation confirmed that the theoretical bandgap of the monoclinic La 2 NiMnO 6 was larger than that of the rhombohedral La 2 NiMnO 6, which was mainly attributed to the B-site distortion. Simultaneously, the top of the VB of La 2 NiMnO 6 mainly come from the interaction of Ni 3 d orbitals and O 2 p orbitals, whereas the bottom of the conduction band primarily come from the hybridization between Mn 3 d and O 2 p orbitals. The results of experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the monoclinic double perovskite La 2 NiMnO 6 is a better candidate as absorbing material than the rhombohedral La 2 NiMnO 6 for solar cells. Finally, general conclusions and future prospects have been presented. The investigations of Pb-based perovskites and Pb-free perovskites solar cells are still facing big challenges. The further studies including architectures designing of devices, recycling of Pb-based perovskites and development of new Pb-free perovskites with high performance are needed. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 281 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the energy levels on the power conversion efficiency of a P 3 HT:PCBM and a MEH-PPV:PV bulk heterojunction cell. We calculate the upper-limit for the efficiency, and make realistic assumptions to predict efficiencies obtainable in the near future. The ideal position of the energy levels of donor and acceptor are obtained from these calculations, giving an idea how the ideal organic solar cell should look like. Also the expected efficiency gain by <b>tuning</b> <b>energy</b> levels, bandgap or absorption window can be derived from the simulations. Our calculations show that, for a bulk heterojunction cell with P 3 HT as donor, reaching efficiencies of 10 % is only possible by adapting the LUMO-level of the electron acceptor. Further, lowering the bandgap of the donor would only increase the efficiency if also the absorption window increases. We also demonstrate that MEH-PPV is not a good donor for organic solar cells, because of the high bandgap. The results indicate that, by changing the energy levels, organic cells could have the potential for reaching higher efficiencies, which is a necessity for future commercial applications...|$|R
