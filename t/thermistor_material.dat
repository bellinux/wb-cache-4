Thermistors are generally a piece of semiconductor made from metal oxides such as those of manganese, nickel, cobalt, etc. These pieces may be made into a bead, disk, wafer, etc depending on the application. There are two types of thermistors – negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors. For NTCs, the resistance decreases with temperature, while for PTCs, the resistance increases with temperature. It is the NTCs that are generally used for temperature measurement. Why would we want to use thermistors for measuring temperature as opposed to other choices such as thermocouples? It is because thermistors have high sensitivity giving more accuracy, a fast response to temperature changes for accuracy and quicker measurements, and relatively high resistance for decreasing the errors caused by the resistance of lead wires themselves...|$|E

Disc shaped green pellets were prepared and effects of sintering on the disc pellets were studied as thermistor by sintering the samples at 1000 °C, 1100 °C and 1200 °C. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), impedance analysis and electrical measurement. The resistivity of the prepared samples varies predictably with temperature: this makes them promising material for temperature sensor. The experimental results prove that nano crystalline CaTiO 3 ceramic is one kind of thermistor with exponential negative temperature coefficient of resistance in the temperature range of 300 – 500 °C. The samples have the advantages of rapid response, high sensitivity and capability to withstand thermal surges over the temperature range of 300 – 500 °C. Resistance-temperature characteristics are described by thermistor equation with thermistor constant around 4003 K to 10795 K and thermal coefficient of resistance α around ∼ 1 %/°C to ∼ 13 %/°C.

The high thermal sensitivity of thermistors {{stems from the fact}} that there is a large change in resistance for a small change in temperature. The relationship between resistance and temperature is approximately of the form R = RO*efl(l’T-l’T~) where R, is the resistance at the reference tem-perature T, and t is the actual absolute tempera-ture (2)., 6 is a constant for the particular <b>thermistor</b> <b>materials</b> employed.

The NETD model is validated and benchmarked using published performance data of state-of-the-art uncooled infrared bolometer arrays. The calculational model is used to evaluate possible infrared sensor and system design tradeoffs that allow optimization for low-cost infrared systems with improved reliability and lifetime, while still achieving a NETD of about 150 mK, required for pedestrian injury mitigation systems.

40|$|Epitaxially grown SiGe(C) {{materials}} {{have a great}} importance for many device applications. In these applications, (strained or relaxed) SiGe(C) layers are grown either selectively on the active areas, or on the entire wafer. Epitaxy is a sensitive step in the device processing and choosing an appropriate thermal budget is crucial to avoid the dopant out–diffusion and strain relaxation. Strain is important for bandgap engineering in (SiGe/Si) heterostructures, and to increase the mobility of the carriers. An example for the latter application is implementing SiGe as the biaxially strained channel layer or in recessed source/drain (S/D) of pMOSFETs. For this case, SiGe is grown selectively in recessed S/D regions where the Si channel region experiences uniaxial strain. The main focus of this Ph. D. thesis is on developing the first empirical model for selective epitaxial growth of SiGe using SiH 2 Cl 2, GeH 4 and HCl precursors in a reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) reactor. The model describes the growth kinetics and considers the contribution of each gas precursor in the gas–phase and surface reactions. In this way, the growth rate and Ge content of the SiGe layers grown on the patterned substrates can be calculated. The gas flow and temperature distribution were simulated in the CVD reactor {{and the results were}} exerted as input parameters for the diffusion of gas molecules through gas boundaries. Fick‟s law and the Langmuir isotherm theory (in non–equilibrium case) have been applied to estimate the real flow of impinging molecules. For a patterned substrate, the interactions between the chips were calculated using an established interaction theory. Overall, a good agreement between this model and the experimental data has been presented. This work provides, for the first time, a guideline for chip manufacturers who are implementing SiGe layers in the devices. The other focus of this thesis is to implement SiGe layers or dots as a <b>thermistor</b> <b>material</b> to detect infrared radiation. The result provides a fundamental understanding of noise sources and thermal response of SiGe/Si multilayer structures. Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and noise voltage have been measured for different detector prototypes in terms of pixel size and multilayer designs. The performance of such structures was studied and optimized as a function of quantum well and Si barrier thickness (or dot size), number of periods in the SiGe/Si stack, Ge content and contact resistance. Both electrical and thermal responses of such detectors were sensitive {{to the quality of the}} epitaxial layers which was evaluated by the interfacial roughness and strain amount. The strain in SiGe material was carefully controlled in the meta–stable region by implementingivcarbon in multi quantum wells (MQWs) of SiGe(C) /Si(C). A state of the art <b>thermistor</b> <b>material</b> with TCR of 4. 5 %/K for 100 × 100 μm 2 pixel area and low noise constant (K 1 /f) value of 4. 4 × 10 - 15 is presented. The outstanding performance of these devices is due to Ni silicide contacts, smooth interfaces, and high quality of multi quantum wells (MQWs) containing high Ge content. The novel idea of generating local strain using Ge multi quantum dots structures has also been studied. Ge dots were deposited at different growth temperatures in order to tune the intermixing of Si into Ge. The structures demonstrated a noise constant of 2 × 10 - 9 and TCR of 3. 44 %/K for pixel area of 70 × 70 μm 2. These structures displayed an improvement in the TCR value compared to quantum well structures; however, strain relaxation and unevenness of the multi layer structures caused low signal–to–noise ratio. In this thesis, the physical importance of different design parameters of IR detectors has been quantified by using a statistical analysis. The factorial method has been applied to evaluate design parameters for IR detection improvements.

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2014. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 55 - 63. Plasmonics is {{touted as}} a milestone in optoelectronics as this technology can form a bridge between electronics and photonics, enabling the integration of electronics and photonic circuits at the nanoscale. Noble metals such as gold and silver have been extensively used for plasmonic applications due {{to their ability to}} support plasmons, yet they suffer from high intrinsic optical losses. Recently, there is an increased effort in the search for alternative plasmonic materials including Si, Ge, III-Nitrides and transparent conductive oxides. The main appeal of these materials, most of them semiconductors, is their lower optical losses, especially in the infrared (IR) regime, compared to noble metals owing to their lower number of free electrons. Other advantages can be listed as low-cost and control on plasma frequency thanks to the tunable electron concentration, i. e. effective doping level. This work focuses on atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown ZnO as a candidate material for plasmonic applications. Optical constants of ZnO are investigated along with figures of merit pertaining to plasmonic waveguides. It is shown that ZnO can alleviate the trade-off between propagation length and mode confinement width owing to tunable dielectric properties. In order to demonstrate plasmonic resonances, a grating structure is simulated using finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method and an ultra-wide-band (4 - 15 µm) infrared absorber is computationally demonstrated. Finally, an all ZnO microbolometer is proposed, where ALD grown ZnO is employed as both the thermistor and the absorber of the microbolometer which is an uncooled infrared imaging unit that relies on the resistance change of the active <b>material</b> (<b>thermistor)</b> as it heats up due to the absorption of incident electromagnetic radiation. The material complexity and process steps of microbolometers could be reduced if the thermistor layer and the absorber layer were consolidated in a single layer. Computational analysis of a basic microbolometer structure using FDTD method is conducted in order to calculate the absorptivity in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) region (8 - 12 µm). In addition, thermal simulations of the microbolometer structure are conducted using finite element method, and time constant and noise-equivalent-temperature-difference (NETD) values are extracted.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} {{characteristics of}} OA-mm-diameter glass rod thermistors, {{which are used}} fre-quently in fast-response CTD and microstructure instruments, have been determined over the speed range of 0. 08 - 3. 8 m/s. The spectral transfer function was obtained by liring the probes through a thin plume and then comparing the power spectrum of the shot data {{with that of a}} slow-speed map of the plume. The spectral transfer functions are described accurately by a two-pole lilter for frequencies less than 25 Hz, although a single-pole form is an equally good representation for less than 10 Hz, The fre-quency of the +-power (3 -dB) attenuation point scales as U’/‘. Although the spectral forms and velocity scaling of the responses of the different probes tested are the same, the levels show sign&ant differences due to irregularities in the glass coatings around the <b>thermistor</b> <b>material.</b> Because of their small size and great sensitivity to temper-ature, thermistors are one of the principal probes used in mea-suring centimeter scale thermal fluctuations in the ocean from moving platforms. However, knowledge of the actual spatial resolution achieved has been limited by the ditsculty of ob-taming accurate measurements of the dynamic response of these probes. The dynamic response function is needed to cor-rect microstructure spectra, to develop algorithms for dealing with ‘salinity spiking ’ in CTD measurements, and to choose optimum fall rata in new instruments. In previous work, estimates of response functions have been made at a few speeds. Fabula [19621 studied a OS-mm-diame-ter glass rod thermistor in a plume tank and concluded that the boundary layer formed in the water was so thin that it was of negligible importance for the dynamic response in relation to the glass coating. It followed that the response should not be a function of probe speed. Although a response function was not obtained, the change in amplitude of the thermistor response to a thin plume as a function of speed was similar to that expected for a single-pole lilter, that is, Ifml ’ = l I + (24) ’ with T- 2 lms...|$|E
