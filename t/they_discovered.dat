5|$|After Davis's death {{early in}} 1915, Lord Carnarvon {{acquired}} the concession to excavate the valley, and he employed Howard Carter to explore it. After a systematic search, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922.|$|E
5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E
50|$|However, {{they have}} greater problems- there are Nazis after them. After {{escaping}} three Nazi planes, <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> several Nazis {{and a dog}} are chasing them. They hide in a barn, and Annie gently strokes the dog, a German Shepherd named Fritz- which calms down and does not betray their location. <b>They</b> <b>discover</b> {{two members of the}} French Resistance-Gaston and Suzette, and share a meal with them. <b>They</b> <b>discover</b> that the couple's sons- Tom and Theo- were captured in Paris by the Nazis. The next day, June 5, 1944, <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> that D-Day is tomorrow and that they must complete their mission that day.|$|R
50|$|Arriving on {{the planet}} surface <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> the {{inhabitants}} are a race of beautiful {{women who want to}} celebrate their arrival. They are given drink which <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> is drugged as they begin to fall unconscious. When they awake, they find themselves in a weakened state brought about by rapid aging. <b>They</b> <b>discover</b> headbands locked around their foreheads which somehow transmit their life-force to the bodies of the women, who are growing in strength.|$|R

5|$|In the Mayflower settlers' first {{explorations of}} Cape Cod, they came across {{evidence}} that Europeans had previously spent extensive time there. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> {{remains of a}} European fort and uncovered a grave that contained the remains of both an adult European male and a Native American child.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was {{converted}} into a Sikh temple and renamed Moti Mandir during the period of the Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh's Sikh Confederacy. He later used the building for the state treasury. When the British took over Punjab in 1849, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> precious stones wrapped in bits of rags and placed in velvet purses scattered inside the mosque, along with other inventory.|$|E
5|$|Although supernovae are {{relatively}} rare events, occurring on average about once every 50 {{years in the}} Milky Way, observations of distant galaxies allowed supernovae to be discovered and examined more frequently. The first supernova detection patrol was begun by Zwicky in 1933. He was joined by Josef J. Johnson from Caltech in 1936. Using a 45-cm Schmidt telescope at Palomar observatory, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> twelve new supernovae within three years by comparing new photographic plates to reference images of extragalactic regions.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{psychological}} profile, the Garda broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme Crimeline with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to contact them. After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> that Dean Lyons had been talking about the killings. Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E
5|$|Bryant died on January 6, 1936, {{of a brain}} {{hemorrhage}} in Sèvres, in {{the suburbs}} of Paris, and is buried in Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles. In 1998, three volunteers from the Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission went to Paris to find the grave, which <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> was crumbling, undated, and scheduled for removal. Through the commission's efforts as well as donations, including some from relatives of Bryant and Bullitt, the grave was restored.|$|E

5|$|By 1998, Meredith's team {{realized}} that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel {{but rather that}} one was the parent of the other. In 2000 <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> that Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić (University of Zagreb) to be Dobričić, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta.|$|E
5|$|Caspar Bartholin, a 17th-century Danish anatomist, {{dismissed}} Colombo's and Falloppio's {{claims that}} <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> the clitoris, {{arguing that the}} clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the second century. Although 17th-century midwives recommended {{to men and women}} that women should aspire to achieve orgasms to help them get pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, notably in the work of Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that strategy is a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E
