Thus, the daily trajectory was defined as a string of 24 letters (POIs). If there was no record at a specific <b>hour,</b> <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> was assigned the semantic value of No Record.|$|R

It is haunted by {{stranger}} things than heron, snipe, or wild duck. Out of this lake, as from the white square stone in Ben Bulben, issues an unearthly troop. Once men began to drain it; suddenly one of them raised a cry that he saw his house in flames. They turned round, and every man there saw his own cottage burning. They hurried home to find it was but faery glamour. To <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> {{the border of the}} lake is shown a half-dug trench--the signet of their impiety.
