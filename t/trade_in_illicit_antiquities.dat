5000|$|The {{export of}} antiquities is now heavily {{controlled}} by law {{in almost all}} countries and by the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, but a large and increasing <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>Illicit</b> <b>antiquities</b> continues.

50|$|In {{addition}} to upstanding practices, a black market exists for great art, which is {{closely tied to}} art theft and art forgery. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security {{in many parts of}} the world is low, a thriving <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> <b>antiquities</b> acquired through looting also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of archeological sites, looted art paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent archaeological looting in Iraq.|$|E

Second, at the same time that most international trade law has moved toward a posture of liberalization, there has been a movement to strengthen the prohibition and punishment of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> transactions. Third, the mechanisms that have developed to regulate this prohibition constitute a significant development in the international legal order...|$|R
50|$|Records in Italian {{courts of}} an {{investigation}} indicate that the krater was looted from an Etruscan tomb in the Greppe Sant'Angelo near Cerveteri in December 1971. The krater was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Robert E. Hecht, an American antiquities dealer living in Rome, for US$1.2 million on November 10, 1972. Hecht, {{who was accused of}} trafficking <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> <b>antiquities,</b> claimed to have acquired the krater from Dikran Sarrafian, a Lebanese dealer, whose family had been in possession of the piece since 1920. Evidence suggests that Hecht may have purchased the krater in 1972 from Giacomo Medici, an Italian dealer who was convicted of selling stolen art in 2005. Hecht denied the charges.|$|R

[...] The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a Geneva, Switzerland warehouse, which contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer, Giacomo Medici, was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be [...] "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market". Medici was sentenced in 2004, by a court in Rome, to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million euros, [...] "the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy".|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely opined in discussions around a number of {{transnational}} criminal markets that where a global economic supply and demand relationship exists, demand reduction by way of consumer education and ‘awareness-raising’ may be an effective intervention <b>in</b> reducing <b>illicit</b> <b>trade.</b> It seems an obvious and sensible suggestion {{on the face of}} it, but just how amenable are consumers to being educated away from purchasing illicitly obtained and trafficked goods, and what are the barriers that {{stand in the way of}} that process of demand reduction through awareness-raising? This paper approaches these questions by asking what are the conditions for guilt-free consumption <b>in</b> the international <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> cultural objects. The paper identifies seven such conditions, and concludes that in this global market we are witnessing the playing out of a common social story in which a powerful group of market capitalists and end-consumers employs a range of sociologically developed linguistic and performative strategies to obfuscate or legitimise their exploitation of a group of less powerful victims. If that is the context for the so-called debate about <b>illicit</b> <b>antiquities,</b> crime-reduction strategies involving consumer education seem considerably more difficult to achieve than {{has been widely}} recognised in policy discussions on transnational crime...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} {{is the product}} of a collaborative venture between criminologists and archaeologists concerned with the international market <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> <b>antiquities.</b> It examines the state of regulation in the antiquities market, with a particular focus on the UK's position, but also with reference to the international context. Looting happens routinely and many countries have rich deposits of cultural material. Antiquities are highly collectable, and there are several prominent international centres for trade. As well as the legitimate face of the antiquities trade there therefore exists an international <b>illicit</b> market <b>in</b> which cultural objects are trafficked for profit in breach of national laws and international conventions. It is within such a complex international and local regulatory context that the essays presented here emerge, focusing upon three areas in particular: the demand for looted antiquities; the supply of cultural artefacts which originate in source countries; and regulation of the international market in antiquities. Criminology has long been interested in transnational crime and its regulation; archaeology in the destructive consequences of antiquities looting in erasing our knowledge of the past. In the papers presented here both disciplines present new data and analysis to forge a more coherent understanding of the nature and failings of the regulatory framework currently in place to combat the criminal market in antiquities...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} links between drug law {{enforcement}} initiatives designed to reduce the availability of illicit drugs, and the <b>illicit</b> drug problem <b>in</b> Australia. Of particular interest are supply-reduction initiatives designed to locate and eradicate the production of <b>illicit</b> drugs <b>in</b> ‘source’ countries; the interdiction of drugs at the border; and attempts to disrupt the distribution of drugs at the community or street level. The examples provided illustrate that rather than reducing or deterring the <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> drugs, many supply-reduction initiatives, when ‘successful’, create conditions that are favourable to the operation and expansion of the trade. This suggests that drug law enforcement is not the ‘solution’ to the drug problem, {{but part of the}} problem.

40|$|We empirically {{analyze the}} <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> {{cultural}} property and antiques, {{taking advantage of}} different reporting incentives between source and destination countries. We thus generate a measure of <b>illicit</b> trafficking <b>in</b> these goods based on the difference between imports recorded in United States' customs data and the (purportedly identical) trade as recorded by customs authorities in exporting countries. We find that this reporting gap is highly correlated with the corruption level of the exporting country as measured by commonly used survey-based indicies, and that this correlation is stronger for artifact-rich countries. As a placebo test, we do not observe any such pattern for U. S. imports of toys from these same exporters. We report similar results for four other Western country markets. Our analysis provides a useful framework for studying <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>illicit</b> goods. Further, our results provide empirical confirmation that survey-based corruption indicies are informative, as they are correlated with an objective measure of illicit activity. ...|$|R

With this thesis, the application of the current European Framework on illicit drugs is applied to three characteristics of the illicit drug trade on the dark net: the lack of borders, its dependency on conventional postal services and the level of anonymity. This study found that the consequences of these characteristics in the field of jurisdiction, controlled deliveries and privacy do not necessarily constitute problems for the application of the current EU Framework on the illicit drug trade on the dark net...|$|R
