5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> occur.|$|E

25|$|Most {{monetary}} flows between nations are not counted as aid. These include market-based flows such as foreign direct investments and portfolio investments, remittances from migrant workers {{to their families}} in their home countries, and military aid. In 2009, aid {{in the form of}} remittances by migrant workers in the United States to their international families was twice as large as that country's humanitarian aid. The World Bank reported that, worldwide, foreign workers sent $328 billion from richer to poorer countries in 2008, over twice as much as official aid flows from OECD members. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> count military aid in its foreign aid figures.|$|E
25|$|The United States and the People's Republic of China {{disagree}} on {{the legality of the}} overflights by U.S. naval aircraft of the area where the incident occurred. This part of the South China Sea comprises part of the PRC's exclusive economic zone based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Chinese claim that Paracel Island belongs to China (this and similar claims have been persistently contested by Vietnam, the Philippines, and international observers). The PRC interprets the Convention as allowing it to preclude other nations' military operations within this area, but <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> recognize China's claim over the Paracel Island and maintains that the Convention grants free navigation for all countries' aircraft and ships, including military aircraft and ships, within a country's exclusive economic zone.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have a {{dedicated}} national stadium like other national teams; instead, {{the team has}} played their home matches at 107 venues in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, located in the national capital of Washington, D.C., has hosted 24 matches, {{the most of any}} stadium. The state of California has hosted 109 matches, the most of any state, and the Los Angeles metropolitan area has hosted 73 matches at several venues in and around the city of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted 20 matches from 1965 to 2000, but fell out of use due to its age. The Rose Bowl, a 92,000-seat venue in Pasadena, has hosted 17 national team matches, as well as the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, and the 1984 Olympics Gold Medal Match.|$|E

25|$|Hanson {{is opposed}} to the Russian {{intervention}} in the Syrian civil war, which he argues {{is a part of}} a bid by Putin to construct an anti-American Russian-Syrian-Iranian-Iraqi alliance that will dominate the Middle East and intimidate the Gulf states. Hanson has made the claim that the primary responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War was not due to Adolf Hitler, but was rather due to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the French Premier Édouard Daladier who failed to maintain credible threats of deterrence. Hanson has argued Obama has likewise failed to maintain a credible threat of deterrence, and as such, the world {{is on the verge of}} another war comparable to the Second World War. Hanson has predicted that Putin will sometime in the near-future invade one or more of the Baltic states if <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> provide more deterrence to Russia.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the {{effectiveness}} of the trade act, specifically the regulations set in place by KPSC. Some critics argue that the KPCS was set in place to allow consumers to buy diamonds without guilt, as opposed to effectively regulating the diamond market. It is thought that the KPSC doesn’t actually address the illegal diamond trade as well as it should. Global Witness decided to leave the KPCS in 2011 due to their dissatisfaction with the ability of KPCS to deal with much of the trade in conflict diamonds. However, others argue that KPCS has made substantial gains in decreasing the illegal market trade. One issue associated with the Clean Diamond Trade Act is that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> inspect rough diamonds coming in or out of the country, so many traders have nothing to deter them from illicit trade. It is suggested that the United States implement more intensive reporting and inspection of rough diamonds to the ensure the success of the trade act.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in 1999 the UPLR was {{amended to}} permit metric-only {{labelling}} and automatically became law {{in those states}} that accept UPLR [...] "as is". [...] By 1 January 2009, 48 out of 50 states permit metric-only labelling, either through UPLR or through their own legislation. [...] the use of metric (and therefore SI) units in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> follow any pattern. Dual-unit labelling on consumer goods is mandatory. Some consumer goods such as soft drinks are sold in metric quantities, but milk is sold in customary units. The engineering industry is equally split. The automotive industry is largely metric, but aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were designed using customary units.|$|E

500|$|The United States is {{a nation}} founded by {{different}} ethnicities frequently described as coming together in a [...] "melting pot," [...] a term used to emphasize {{the degree to which}} constituent groups influence and are influenced by each other, or a [...] "salad bowl," [...] a term more recently coined in contrast to the [...] "melting pot" [...] metaphor and emphasizing those groups' retention of fundamentally distinct identities despite their proximity to each other and their influence on the overall culture that all of those groups inhabit. A controversial political issue {{in recent years has been}} the question of bilingualism. Many immigrants have come from Hispanic America, who are native Spanish speakers, in the past centuries and have become a significant minority and even a majority in many areas of the Southwest. In New Mexico the Spanish speaking population exceeds 40%. Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizeable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language. The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials and whether or not English is the official language. It has evolved into an ethnic conflict between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the official English movement. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have an official language, but English is the default national language, spoken by the overwhelming majority of the country's population.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> draw a {{distinction}} between lawyers as pleaders (barristers) and lawyers as agents (or solicitors). All lawyers who have passed a bar examination and have been admitted to practice may prosecute or defend in the courts of the state where they are admitted. Historically, {{a distinction}} was made, and a separate label for barristers (called [...] "counselors", hence the expression [...] "attorney and counselor at law") existed in certain states, though both professions have long since been fused into the all-purpose attorney. Attorneys specializing in court procedure, combining advocacy and case preparation, are called trial attorneys or litigators.|$|E
