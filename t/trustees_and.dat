5|$|Bath is twinned {{with four}} other cities in Europe. Twinning is the {{responsibility}} of the Charter <b>Trustees</b> <b>and</b> each twinning arrangement is managed by a Twinning Association.|$|E
5|$|Each of the townships has {{a trustee}} who administers rural fire {{protection}} and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> board members are elected to four-year terms.|$|E
5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

5|$|Cal Poly at Pomona {{is one of}} two polytechnics in the 23-member California State University system. The CSU {{system is}} governed by a 25-member board of trustees, {{including}} one faculty trustee, one alumni trustee, and two student <b>trustees,</b> <b>and</b> has authority over curricular development, campus planning, and fiscal management. The university system is currently governed by Chancellor Charles B. Reed, who assumed the office in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure {{that would have allowed}} collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{the more}} famous Stanley Cup, members of the winning teams are allowed time to {{celebrate}} with the trophy in their own fashion, often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada. The board of directors for the Canadian Football Hall of Fame act as the Grey Cup's <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> control its rental for events. The trophy {{is accompanied by a}} designated representative of the Hall of Fame at all times. Like the Stanley Cup, but unlike the Vince Lombardi Trophy, a new trophy is not made every year.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 35 {{individuals}} who have served as mayor. Joshua Bean, elected in 1850, was the first mayor of the city. Edwin M. Capps, who served as mayor in the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{is the only person}} who served two non-consecutive terms. From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a Board of <b>Trustees</b> <b>and</b> there was no elected mayor. However, the president of the board was called mayor as a courtesy.|$|E
5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold.|$|E

5|$|Because Bath is unparished, {{there is}} no longer a city council (or parish council) — Bath City Council having ended in 1996 with the {{abolition}} of the district of Bath. The City of Bath's ceremonial functions, including its formal status as a city, its twinning arrangements, the mayoralty of Bath– which can be traced back to 1230– and control of the city's coat of arms, are maintained by the charter trustees of the City of Bath. The councillors elected by the electoral wards that cover Bath (see below) are the <b>trustees,</b> <b>and</b> they elect one of their number as mayor.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping the Torah {{after it has}} been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of <b>trustees,</b> <b>and</b> in 1975, the congregation began calling women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, the {{organization}} joined {{with other groups}} including the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, National Coalition Against Censorship, the Heartland Institute, National Association of Scholars, Alliance Defense Fund Center for Academic Freedom, Feminists for Free Expression, American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, Accuracy in Academia, and the American Council of <b>Trustees</b> <b>and</b> Alumni {{to send a letter}} asking the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights to use the precedent of the 1999 Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education case to apply a definition of harassment for academic institutions (so as not to harm freedom of speech). In 2012, Buck Angel served on {{the organization}}'s Board of Directors of the organization, and sexologist Megan Andelloux served as an advisory board member. Lawrence G. Walters was the general counsel for Woodhull in 2012.|$|E

5|$|In the 1860s, {{the income}} from the {{navigation}} had dropped, {{as a result of}} attempts to compete against the railways, but economies were made, and capital works continued. The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee <b>trustees,</b> <b>and</b> after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue. Nor could they be closed, since they allowed surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames, without causing flooding.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu University (MU) is a {{non-governmental}} {{university that}} {{is governed by}} a Board of <b>Trustees</b> <b>and</b> a University Council. It {{is the brainchild of}} a number of professors from the Somali National University as well as other Somali intellectuals. Financed by the Islamic Development Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as well as other donor institutions, the university counts hundreds of graduates from its seven faculties, some of whom continue on to pursue Master's degrees abroad thanks to a scholarship programme. Mogadishu University has established partnerships with several other academic institutions, including the University of Aalborg in Denmark, three universities in Egypt, seven universities in Sudan, the University of Djibouti, and two universities in Yemen. , MU also has accreditation with the Board of the Intergovernmental Organization EDU.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E

5|$|UM {{is led by}} a {{board of}} trustees, which holds two {{meetings}} each year. The board has 48 elected members, 3 alumni representatives, 23 senior members, 4 national members, 6 ex officio members, 14 emeriti members and 1 student representative. Ex officio members, who serve {{by virtue of their}} positions in the university, include the president of the university; the president and immediate past president of the citizens board; and the president, president-elect and immediate past president of the alumni association. Since 1982, the board has eleven visiting committees, which include both <b>trustees</b> <b>and</b> outside experts, to help oversee the individual academic units.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. <b>Trustees</b> <b>and</b> the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
5|$|According to the statutes, the Foundation {{consists}} of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members, a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, {{all the members of}} the board have been chosen by the <b>trustees,</b> <b>and</b> the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.|$|E
