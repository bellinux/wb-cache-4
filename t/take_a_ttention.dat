Based on both the literature on family caregiving and on family violence, four factors are hypothesized to explain these two dimensions of violence: caregiving demands, interactional stressors, caregiver characteristics, and caregiving context. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data on 236 family caregivers to dementia victims revealed several characteristics that were predictive of violent feelings {{on the part of}} caregivers, including physical aggression by the care recipient, disruptive behaviors, and a shared living situation.

40|$|Co liac {{disease is}} an auto-immune disease, {{which means that}} the body {{produces}} antibodies that attack its own tissues. For people with coeliac disease this attack is triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. This gluten-intolerance causes an inflammatory response that damages the gut. When the gut lining is damaged, the body cannot absorb a 11 the n cessary nutrients from food. Because of this lack of nutrients, people with undiagnosed coeliac disease can have a wide range of symptoms and can suffer from nu tritional deficiencies. The symptoms are v ry individual but can include stomach and bowel symptoms, tiredness, anaemia, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, weight loss and vomiting, so it can take some hrne before an accu rate diagnosis is sought. Both adults and children can have this disease. There is evidence to suggest that the p revalence of coeliac disease is 1 in 200 - 300 people in The Czech republic.

40|$|Introduction. Streptococcal necrotizing {{fasciitis}} (NF) {{is a serious}} soft tissue infection with rapid progression of inflammatory process among superficial or deep fascia, systemic host response to infection leading to toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and multiple organ failure. Lethality is high. Case Outline. A 46 -year-old male without co-morbidities {{was admitted to the}} Emergency Department with redness, swelling and pain on his right lower leg. He became sick two day s ea rlier with m alaise, chills and shivering. On admission he was hypotensive, anuric, with erythematous rash on his face, neck and chest, with acute ren al failure and elevated creatine phosphokinase level. During the next several hours, the changes on his right lower leg rapidly spread to the whole leg, followed by skin destruction and subcutaneo us bleeding, indicating NF. Aggressive antimicrobial, supportive and symptom atic therapy was initiated immediately and on the same evening surgical intervention was performed. Despite these measures, a rapid development of severe TSS, with lethal outcome, occurred in less than 40 hours after the admission. Stre ptococcus pyogenes (group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus) was isolated from the throat, skin and tissue obtained duri ng the surgery. Conclusion.

The objectives of this project were to investigate th e modes of th e cello, to compare and contrast the modes of the cello to those of th e violin, and to suggest a system of nomenclature for th e vibrational modes observed in th e cello. This thesis discusses th e experiments, data, results and conclusions on a school-grade cello owned by th e author. To perform a modal analysis, the cello was driven into sinusoidal vibrations by three separate methods: 1) a mechanical bridge drive, 2) an internal oscillating sound pressure, and 3) an external sound field. To help find the resonance frequencies of the cello, sound spectra and accelerance spectra were recorded. Holographic interferometry images of th e cello, driven at its resonance frequencies, revealed how th e cello was moving at these frequencies from which a classification of th e modes of vibration of th e cello was made. The modes of vibration were determined by holographic interferometry using all three driving methods over a frequency range of 90 Hz to 400 Hz. Experiments were also performed to find th e cavity air modes. By damping out the vibrations of the cello body, th e vibrational modes of the air inside the cavity were determined. The modes found in the cello were compared to modes found in violins, and a system of mode nomenclature is suggested. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

40|$|This report re-assesses {{the open}} access (OA) {{availability}} of scholarly publications during the 2004 to 2011 period, for 22 fields of knowledge, {{as well as}} for the European Research Area countries, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the US. Using a strategy to increase the number of free articles retrieved (that is, which aims to increasing recall), led to close to a doubling of the proportion of OA estimated by teams led by Björk and by Harnad. The present report shows that the tipping point for OA (more than 50 % of th e papers available for free) has been reached in several countries, including Brazil, Switzerland, th e Netherlands, the US, as well as in biomedical research, biology, and mathematics and statistics. Between 2004 and 2011, the average annual rate of increase of OA availability was relatively limited, with a compound growth rate of 2 % per ye ar. In addition to having year-on-year growth, there is an upward translation of the whole av ailability curve over time. This is due to an increasing number of authors making their manu scripts available for the current year but also for previous years. There are also transient effects that have to be considered when measuring OA availability, including temporary promotional OA offered by publishers and vari ations in websites’ availability. All in all, more than 50 % of the papers could be found for free in November/December 2012 (pilot phase of this study) and in March/April 2013 (1 st full measurement stage) but somewhat less so at ei ther time period. This shows that measuring phenomena on the Internet requires particular <b>a</b> <b>ttention</b> to detail and constant questioning on the meaning of the results. Green OA appears to be moving slowly, whereas go ld and hybrid OA (such as pay-per-article for OA release) appear to be driving in the fast lane. This impression will require further investigation. Efforts should be made to characterise these changes, and to distinguish what percentage of growth comes from green self- archiving and what comes from other forms of hybrid OA. The fact that the open access tipping point has likely been reached is an important finding for the whole publishing industry. This industry is likely to be undergoing revolutionary change, and at a pace much faster than anticipated, in large part because previous measures of OA availability proved to be misleading. This means that aggressive publishers are likely to gain much in the redesigned landscape, whereas those attached to the old ways are likely to suffer and to lose market share. An important question is whether the switch to a more atomistic, fine-grained market with millions of researchers as buyers will reduce, augment or leave unchanged the negotiating power of publishers...|$|R
