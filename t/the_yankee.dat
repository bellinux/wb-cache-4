5|$|In 1941, WOR's {{official}} city of license {{was changed}} to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.|$|E

5|$|Edward Grant Barrow (May 10, 1868– December 15, 1953) was an American {{manager and}} front office {{executive}} in Major League Baseball. He {{served as the}} field manager of the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox. He served as business manager (de facto general manager) of the New York Yankees from 1921 to 1939 and as team president from 1939 to 1945, and is credited with building <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> dynasty. Barrow {{was elected to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> {{selected}} Mesa in the 24th {{round of}} the 2012 MLB draft. Mesa signed with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b> In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> assigned him to <b>the</b> Staten Island <b>Yankees</b> of <b>the</b> Class A-Advanced New York-Penn League.|$|R
50|$|On October 18, 2015 <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> fired their hitting coach, {{after just}} one season, Jeff Pentland.

5|$|Edwin H. Armstrong {{installed}} an FM-broadcasting {{station on}} the top of Mount Washington in 1937. The station included the original broadcast tower, <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Building, which housed the crew and transmitter equipment, and the first power house building. The station stopped operating in 1948, due to excessive maintenance costs. The original Armstrong tower still stands today. <b>The</b> <b>Yankee</b> Building also remains and continues to serve as a communications facility, housing equipment for numerous tenants including cellular telephone providers and public safety agencies. The only building no longer standing from Armstrong's original station is the original power house which was destroyed by fire in 2003 when a fire spread to it that had started in a neighboring building. In 1954 a TV tower and transmitters were installed for WMTW, Channel8, licensed to Poland Spring, Maine. The station continuously broadcast until 2002 {{from the top of the}} mountain, including local forecasts by (now retired) WMTW transmitter engineer Marty Engstrom.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth, who is {{now working}} for Tracy, learns that working for Tracy is more than he expected. Tracy orders Kenneth to {{complete}} several tasks, including going to <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium for nachos, and picking up an important package, {{which turns out to}} be an illegal fish that Tracy wants to put in his aquarium. Tracy then tells Kenneth to buy something for his wife, Angie Jordan (Sharon Wilkins), and to take her to a fancy restaurant, where he gives her Tracy's gift.|$|E
5|$|Nichols {{left the}} Atomic Energy Commission in 1955 {{and opened a}} {{consulting}} firm on K Street, specializing in commercial atomic energy research and development. His clients included Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Rowe Nuclear Power Station. Nichols was involved {{with the construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Rowe Nuclear Power Station, the first privately owned pressurized-water plant, and the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, which commenced operation in 1961 and 1968 respectively. They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in coal and oil prices. He was critical of over-regulation and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took almost twice as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|E
50|$|Holland's and ten other players' {{suspensions}} {{were reduced}} to anti-drug donations and community service, but Holland's career was nearly at an end.

Holland was released by <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> a third time after the season and his major league career was over.|$|R
50|$|Normally, Johnson {{would have}} had to pay <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> an {{indemnity}} for moving to Kansas City, and also {{would have had}} to reimburse <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> for <b>the</b> costs they incurred for moving the Blues to Denver {{to make way for the}} A's. Major-league rules of the time gave <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>the</b> major-league rights to Kansas City. However, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> waived these payments as soon as the purchase was approved. This, combined with the Yankees' thinly concealed support for the sale, led to rumors of collusion between Johnson and <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the season, Pettitte {{declined}} his 2008 option, {{becoming a}} free agent. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> offered Pettitte salary arbitration, and Pettite accepted <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> offer. He signed a one-year, $16million contract with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> on December 12.|$|R
5|$|Stengel {{also participated}} in Old-Timers' Day {{at a number of}} ballparks, including, regularly, Shea Stadium. In 1970, the Yankees invited him to Old-Timers' Day, at which his number, 37, was to be retired. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> {{ownership}} had changed, and the people responsible for his dismissal were no longer with the team. He accepted and attended, and Stengel became the fifth Yankee to have his number retired. He thereafter became a regular at the Yankees' Old-Timers' Day.|$|E
5|$|Whitey Ford, Ron Guidry, and Mel Stottlemyre {{hold the}} Yankees {{record for most}} Opening Day starts with seven.

Jimmy Key holds <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> record for best Opening Day record with a perfect 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E
50|$|From 2005 to 2009 Jackson rose up <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> {{organization}} {{and after a}} slow start, he became a top prospect for <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b> For <b>the</b> 2009 season he was <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> top prospect according to Baseball America.|$|R
50|$|Holmes {{signed with}} <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> on December 22, 1997. In 34 relief {{appearances}} with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> Holmes posted an 0-3 {{record and a}} 3.33 ERA. Despite not earning a win in the regular season, and picking up two saves, he appeared on <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> postseason roster and earned a World Series ring when <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> swept <b>the</b> Padres in 1998.|$|R
5|$|Ron Guidry {{started for}} <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> while Mike Torrez {{started for the}} Red Sox. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> fell behind 2–0, with a home run by Carl Yastrzemski and a run batted in single by Jim Rice. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> took <b>the</b> lead on a three run home run by Bucky Dent. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Red Sox 5–4, with Guidry getting the win, while Goose Gossage recorded a save. With <b>the</b> victory, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> clinched <b>the</b> AL East championship, en route to winning the 1978 World Series. , <b>the</b> '78 <b>Yankees</b> remain <b>the</b> last team to have won the World Series after playing a tiebreaker.|$|R
5|$|In {{taking control}} of the studio, General Tire {{restored}} RKO's links to broadcasting. General Tire had bought <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network, a New England regional radio network, in 1943. In 1950, it purchased the West Coast regional Don Lee Broadcasting System, and two years later, the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, owner of the WOR TV and radio stations in New York City. The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the Mutual Broadcasting System, one of America's leading radio networks. General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton {{region is}} also known for the many golf courses and clubs that it hosts. The Miami Valley Golf Club, Moraine Country Club, NCR Country Club, and the Pipestone Golf Course {{are some of the}} more notable courses. In addition, several PGA Championships have been held at area golf courses. The Miami Valley Golf Club hosted the 1957 PGA Championship, the Moraine Country Club hosted the 1945 PGA Championship, and the NCR Country club hosted the 1969 PGA Championship.Additionally, NCR CC hosted the 1986 U.S. Women's Open and the 2005 U.S. Senior Open. Other notable courses include <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Trace Golf Club, the Beavercreek Golf Club, Dayton Meadowbrook Country Club, Sycamore Creek Country Club, Heatherwoode Golf Club, Community Golf Course, and Kitty Hawk Golf Course.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1952, General Tire {{purchased}} the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations {{and the rights}} to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post). Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of Mutual. That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined. Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.|$|E
50|$|On July 6, 1914, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> sent Bill Holden {{and cash}} to Baltimore of the International League for Cree. He {{was sold to}} Baltimore after a mediocre 1913 season with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> wanted him back.|$|R
50|$|On November 8, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> re-signed {{free agent}} outfielder Chris Young to a 1-year, $2.5 million {{contract}} with incentives. On November 12, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> signed left-hander José de Paula to a 1-year major league contract worth $500,000. That same day, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> traded longtime backup catcher Francisco Cervelli to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for left-hander Justin Wilson.On December 3, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> signed reliever Esmil Rogers to a 1-year, $1.48 million contract. On December 5, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> acquired shortstop Didi Gregorius from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade involving the Detroit Tigers. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> sent Shane Greene to the Tigers {{as part of the}} trade. That same day, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> signed reliever Andrew Miller to a 4-year, $36 million deal. On December 15, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> re-signed free agent third baseman Chase Headley, to a 4-year deal worth $52 million. On December 16, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> re-signed left-hander Chris Capuano to a 1-year, $5 million deal. On December 19, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> traded utility infielder Martín Prado to the Miami Marlins, along with pitcher David Phelps, in exchange for pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, 1B/OF Garrett Jones, and pitching prospect Domingo German. Also on December 19, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> acquired relief pitcher Gonzalez Germen from the New York Mets, in exchange for cash considerations. He was later traded to the Texas Rangers on January 20, again in exchange for cash considerations. On December 29, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> traded reliever Shawn Kelley to the San Diego Padres, in exchange for minor league pitcher Johnny Barbato.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> claimed him off waivers from Florida on May 26, , {{where he}} played for the Columbus Clippers the Triple-A team for <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> at <b>the</b> time. He played there until <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> {{released}} him on August 6, 2004.|$|R
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|One of North America's major {{radio and}} {{television}} broadcasters from the 1950s through the late 1980s, RKO General traces its roots to the 1943 purchase of <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> Network by General Tire. In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together {{under the rubric of}} RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, GenCorp's) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, Muzak (dept. store and elevator piped-in) music, Video Independent Theatre (135 theatres strong) Circuit, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original Frontier Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Stengel {{had become}} {{famous for his}} humorous and {{sometimes}} disjointed way of speech while with the Yankees, and these skills of showmanship served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. Stengel retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events {{for the rest of}} his life. Although Stengel is sometimes described as one of the great managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was only a good manager when given good players. Stengel is remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> adopted uniform {{numbers in}} 1929, McCarthy never wore a number with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|March 19, 1974: Jerry Moses {{was traded}} by <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> to <b>the</b> Detroit Tigers {{as part of}} a 3-team trade. The Cleveland Indians sent Walt Williams and Rick Sawyer to <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> and <b>the</b> Tigers sent Ed Farmer to <b>the</b> <b>Yankees.</b> <b>The</b> Tigers sent Jim Perry to the Indians.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> took <b>the</b> Series {{in seven}} {{games for the}} 20th {{championship}} in team history. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> had won their first World Series in 1923; of the 40 Series played between 1923 and 1962, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> won half. After a long dominance of the World Series picture, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> would not win another World Series for another 15 years despite appearances in 1963, 1964 and 1976.|$|R
5|$|Stengel often rotated infielders between positions, {{with the}} Yankees having no real regular second baseman or shortstop between 1954 and 1958. Despite this, the Yankees {{had a strong}} {{defensive}} infield throughout. Stengel gave great attention to the double play, both defensively and in planning his lineup, and the Yankees responded by being first {{in the league in}} double plays as a defense six times in his twelve-year tenure, and the batters hit into the fewest double plays as a team eight times in that era. Having had few players he could rely upon while managing Brooklyn and Boston, Stengel treated his Yankee roster with little sentimentality, trading players quickly when their performance seemed to decline, regardless of past accomplishments. Assured of quality replacements secured by <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> front office, the technique worked well, but was not a success with the Mets, where no quality replacements were available, and the technique caused confusion and apathy among the players.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yankee</b> {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first when}} Matsui hit a two-run home run with Rodriguez on base after a walk. The Phillies {{responded with a}} triple by Ruiz, who scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Rollins {{in the top of}} the third inning. Matsui added to <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> lead with a bases-loaded single in the bottom of the inning, scoring Jeter and Damon. Martínez was relieved after four innings by Durbin, who allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who later scored on a Teixeira single. Durbin hit Rodriguez and was relieved by Happ after recording one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E

50|$|Cessa {{was named}} to the Yankees' Opening Day roster in 2016. He made his major league debut for <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> on April 8. He pitched two innings, {{allowing}} two hits, one home run, and two strikeouts as <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> were shut out by the Detroit Tigers, 0-4. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> optioned Cessa to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League on April 15, 2016, in exchange for Tyler Olson. On May 17, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> recalled Cessa for AAA Scranton/WB. On June 7, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> optioned him to AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. On June 26, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> recalled Cessa from AAA Scranton/WB. On June 29, Cessa earned his first Major League win, pitching 3 innings of 1-run relief.|$|R
50|$|After {{the season}} ended, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> signed Dave Winfield to a 10-year contract. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> fired Howser and {{replaced}} him with Gene Michael. Under Michael, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> led <b>the</b> AL East before a strike hit in June 1981. In {{the second half}} of <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> struggled under Bob Lemon, who replaced Michael. Thanks to the split-season playoff format, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> faced <b>the</b> second-half winner Milwaukee Brewers in the special 1981 American League Division Series. After narrowly defeating Milwaukee in five games, they breezed through Billy Martin and the Oakland Athletics in a three-game ALCS. In the World Series, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> got off to a hot start by winning the first two games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. But the Dodgers fought back and stunned <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> by winning <b>the</b> next four games to clinch their first World Series title since 1965.|$|R
