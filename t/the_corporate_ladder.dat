While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees.

25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder.</b> They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

Steven Grover was found to be trolling websites that have posted pro-CIW positions and opinions; under an assumed screen name, Grover posted several comments disparaging the ethics and honesty of the leadership of the group. Besides the trolling incident, Grover was tied to several terse, stridently worded e-mails sent from a possibly fictitious employee name at the BK global headquarters in Miami to supporters and media groups; the company labeled these communications as unsanctioned and not reflecting official corporate positions. Additionally, Burger King was found to have hired an outside security company, Pembroke Pines, Florida based Diplomatic Tactical Services, to infiltrate the CIW and its supporting groups and spy on their members. After these issues came to light, BK terminated Grover and company spokesman Keva Silversmith, as well as its relationship with Diplomatic Tactical Services. Critics of the personnel action, such as PR Watch editor Sheldon Rampton, noted that it appeared that the two terminated employees were being made scapegoats by the company. Rampton went on to note that Silversmith had been, up to {{a few weeks before the}} story came to light, employed by the PR firm Edelman, which had been contracted by company parent Burger King Brands to provide PR services; Edelman has employed tactics on the behalf of its other clients, Wal-Mart and Microsoft, which Rampton and his organization termed [...] "sleazy". [...] Sen. Sanders agreed with Rampton's claim of scapegoating, and called for hearings into the incidents to investigate the company's behaviors to see if other Burger King officers had instigated the attacks on the labor group as company policy.

5000|$|Adler (1975) {{proposed}} that the emancipation of women during the 1970s increased economic opportunities for women and allowed women to be as crime-prone as men. While [...] "women have demanded equal opportunity {{in the fields of}} legitimate endeavours, a similar number of determined women have forced their way into the world of major crime such as white-collar crime, murder, and robbery" [...] (Adler, 1975: 3). She suggested that as women were climbing up <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> business <b>ladder,</b> they were making use of their 'vocational liberation' to pursue careers in white-collar crime. However, feminism has made female crime more visible through increased reporting, policing and the sentencing of female offenders and, even then, the statistical base is small in comparison to men. Carlen (1985) argues that Adler's 'new female criminal' is cast as the 'biological female' who is essentially masculine. The 'new female' criminal {{turns out to be the}} 'old maladjusted masculine female' of traditional criminology, rejecting her proper feminine role such as institutionalising rather than incarcerating women who commit 'male' offences such as robbery, i.e. Adler's 'sisters in crime' appears to work within the frameworks of traditional criminology rather than a feminist one.

However, this study, based on an in-depth case study on Campina, the second largest dairy company in the Netherlands, has its primary focus not on direct financial implications of stakeholder management, but on the impact proactive stakeholder management has on the interaction between companies and public authorities.

She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of [...] "pure being." [...] Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness.

2500|$|Similar to {{the sticky}} floor, the frozen middle {{describes}} {{the phenomenon of}} women's progress up <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> slowing, if not halting, {{in the ranks of}} middle management. Originally the term referred to the resistance corporate upper management faced from middle management when issuing directives. Due to a lack of ability or lack of drive in the ranks of middle management these directives do not come into fruition and as a result the company's bottom line suffers.The term was popularized by a Harvard Business Review article titled [...] "Middle Management Excellence". Due to the growing proportion of women to men in the workforce, however, the term [...] "frozen middle" [...] has become more commonly ascribed to the aforementioned slowing of the careers of women in middle management. The 1996 study [...] "A Study of the Career Development and Aspirations of Women in Middle Management" [...] posits that social structures and networks within businesses that favor [...] "good old boys" [...] and norms of masculinity exist based on the experiences of women surveyed. According to the study, women who did not exhibit stereotypical masculine traits, (e.g. aggressiveness, thick skin, lack of emotional expression) and interpersonal communication tendencies are at an inherent disadvantage compared to their male peers. As the ratio of men to women increases in the upper levels of management, women's access to female mentors who could advise them on ways to navigate office politics is limited, further inhibiting upward mobility within a corporation or firm. Furthermore, the frozen middle affects female professionals in western and eastern countries such as the United States and Malaysia, respectively, as well as women in a variety of fields ranging from the aforementioned corporations to STEM fields.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} {{principal}} photography was completed, Ashby had his editor send {{what he had}} cut together so far. The director was shocked at the results and fired the editor. He was afraid {{that he would have}} to edit the film himself. Ayres recommended bringing in Robert C. Jones, one of the fastest editors in the business, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Jones put the film back into rushes and six weeks later had a first cut ready that ran four hours. Ashby was very impressed with his abilities and trusted him completely. Jones cut the film with Ashby at the filmmaker's home. The process took an unusually long time, as the director agonized over all the footage he had shot. Ashby would ignore phone calls from Columbia, and eventually executives higher and higher up <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> tried to contact him. Ashby was in London, England meeting with Peter Sellers about doing Being There when he received a phone call from Jones, who told him that Columbia was fed up with the time it was taking for the film to be assembled. The head of the studio's editing department called Jones to say that a representative was coming to take the film. Jones refused to give up the film, and Ashby called the studio and managed to calm down the officials. Towne occasionally visited Ashby's house to check in and did not like the pacing of the film. According to Towne, Ashby [...] "left his dramatizing to the editing room, and the effect was a thinning out of the script". During the editing process, Columbia hated the jump cuts Ashby employed. The studio was also concerned about the number of expletives. It needed a commercial hit as they were in major financial trouble. By August 1973, the final cut of The Last Detail was completed and submitted to the MPAA, which gave it an R rating.|$|E
40|$|Graphic {{design is}} one of the {{elements}} of today’s environment. It communicates meanings, identifies things, navigates people, and imparts knowledge in physical visible forms. We can see it everywhere: in the street signs, books, newspapers, packages, labels, clothes, billboards, etc. Since ideas and messages find their visual appearance in printed, published, or other visual forms, this means there are clients that order these design projects and designers that make them a reality. Since there are many examples of great and poor design, this means creative cooperation may be effective and clear or mutual understanding may be missed. In this context, relationships between the graphic designer and a client become the main topic of this research. This work aims to discover the reasons of spoiling of relations and offer practical guidelines that help graphic designers and their clients to improve their business cooperation. In order to reach the main goal, this study describes the idea of the graphic designer and a client. Graphic designer is a mediator of ideas between producer and consumer and creator of experiences that can change behavior of individuals. In this context, designer’s social responsibilities, inner culture, education, career opportunities, and professional growth stay in the focus of this research. Since design is a result of designer’s activity, designer is responsible for success or failure of the project. However, client acts as equal in rights participant of the design process. This research presents a client from <b>the</b> position on <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> and level of familiarization with design. The existing literature on the current topic describes disrespect, lack of responsibility, unethical behavior, stereotypes, and lack of clarity as the main reasons of spoiling of relationships between the graphic designer and a client. Two practical cases prove theoretical findings and outline possible solutions to improve these relations. Results provided by the cases become a basis for further research and conclusions. This study concludes with general guidelines that help graphic designers and their clients to speak clear language and provide effective design. Practical solutions suggest respect, ethical behavior, honesty, flexibility, overcoming stereotypes, individual approach to a client, and thinking several steps forward as core elements of profitable and fruitful cooperation. Also, they suggest concept of socially responsible design, payment strategies, and techniques to keep clients coming back and adapt to existing business conditions...|$|R
