40|$|AbstractThe binding {{properties}} of human Tamm-Horsfall Sd(a+) urinary glycoprotein (THGP) and asialo-THGP with Triticum vulgaris agglutinin(WGA) and three <b>toxic</b> <b>lectins</b> (abrin-a, ricin, and Mistletoe toxic lectin-I) were investigated by quantitative precipitin and precipitin inhibition assays. Both glycoproteins reacted strongly with abrin-a, precipitating over 80 % of the lectin nitrogen tested. THGP also bound well to mistletoe toxic lectin-I and precipitated 86 % of this lectin added, while the precipitability of its asialo product decreased by 28 %. The native glycoprotein completely precipitated the WGA added, but its reactivity was reduced dramatically after desialylation. On the contrary, the poor reactivity of THGP with ricin increased substantially after removal of sialic acid and completely precipitated the lectin added. The glycoprotein-lectin interactions were inhibited {{by one or}} several of the following haptens, p-NO 2 -phenylαGalNAc, p-NO 2 -phenylβGalNAc, Galβ 1 → 4 GlcNAc, Galβ 1 → 4 Glc, GlcNAcβ 1 → 4 GlcNAc, and/or GlcNAc.

Castor seeds also contain the proteins ricin and R. communis agglutinin (RCA), two <b>toxic</b> <b>lectins</b> that are hazardous to human health. Radial immunodiffusion (RID) and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are two antibody-based methods commonly used to quantify ricin and RCA; however, antibodies currently used in these methods cannot distinguish between ricin and RCA due to the high sequence homology of the respective proteins. In this study, a technique combining antibody-based affinity capture with liquid chromatography and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to quantify the amounts of ricin and RCA independently in extracts prepared from the seeds of eighteen representative cultivars of R. 20 communis which were propagated under identical conditions. Additionally, liquid chromatography and MRM-MS was used to determine rRNA N-glycosidase activity for each cultivar and the overall activity in these cultivars was compared to a purified ricin standard.

The ricin B-RNase A hybrid was tested for cell binding, cellular uptake, and intoxication in four kinds of cells, rat liver and testis Leydig cells （normal and primarily cultured cells）, and HeLa and BeWo cells （transformed cells）. The ricin B-RNase A hybrid inhibited cellular protein synthesis equally {{in all four}} cells, while incubation of each cell mentioned above with RNase A or ricin B chain alone neither gave effect on cellular protein synthesis nor cell viability.

The degree of internalization of the ricin B-RNase A hybrid into cells was almost equal in four types of cells, about 10 % of the bound hybrid.

40|$|The rapid {{detection}} of pathogenic organisms to ensure appropriate administration of treatment remains a global healthcare challenge. This {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult, as identification of the organism alone is no longer enough, {{with the rise of}} drug resistance amongst many pathogens it is becoming increasingly important that both the pathogen and drug resistance are identified. Currently, rapid identification can be achieved through a variety of techniques. However, many of these techniques are expensive, require extensive sample preparation, or highly trained personnel to run with results often not rapidly available. This leaves health care professionals to make point-of-care treatment decisions based on symptoms without any indication of drug resistance. The use of carbohydrate microarrays for pathogen detection has been identified as both a method for detection but also as a basis for identifying new drug targets. This exploits the initial protein-carbohydrate interaction that many pathogens utilise in the initial stages of infection. However, the use of microarrays is also challenging, as highly sensitive identification of pathogens often requires expensive or synthetically challenging oligosaccharides or coupling with a highly sensitive detection method thus limiting its point of care application. Herein we describe the coupling of a facile surface chemistry for glycan addition with a powerful statistical algorithm to improve the sensitivity of a cheap monosaccharide functionalised surface without using expensive detection methodologies. This technique was then applied to the detection and identification of <b>toxic</b> <b>lectins,</b> bacterial samples and finally the life-stage specific {{detection of}} Plasmodium falciparum (one of the parasites responsible for human malaria).

40|$|BACKGROUND Lectins are carbohydrate-binding {{proteins}} {{that are involved}} in fundamental intra- and extracellular biological processes. They occur ubiquitously in nature and are especially abundant in plants and fungi. It has been well established that certain higher fungi produce lectins in their fruiting bodies and/or sclerotia as a part of their natural resistance against free-living fungivorous nematodes and other pests. Despite relatively high diversity of the glycan structures in nature, many of the glycans targeted by fungal lectins are conserved among organisms of the same taxon and sometimes even among different taxa. Such conservation of glycans between free-living and parasitic nematodes is providing us with a useful tool for discovery of novel chemotherapeutic and vaccine targets. In our study, a subset of fungal lectins emanating from toxicity screens on Caenorhabditis elegans was tested for their potential to inhibit larval development of Haemonchus contortus. METHODS The effect of Coprinopsis cinerea lectins - CCL 2, CGL 2, CGL 3; Aleuria aurantia lectin - AAL; Marasmius oreades agglutinin - MOA; and Laccaria bicolor lectin - Lb-Tec 2, on cultivated Haemonchus contortus larval stages was investigated using a larval development test (LDT). To validate the results of the toxicity assay and determine lectin binding capacity to the nematode digestive tract, biotinylated versions of lectins were fed to pre-infective larval stages of H. contortus and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Lectin histochemistry on fixed adult worms was performed to investigate the presence and localisation of lectin binding sites in the disease-relevant developmental stage. RESULTS Using an improved larval development test we found that four of the six tested lectins: AAL, CCL 2, MOA and CGL 2, exhibited a dose-dependent toxicity in LDT, as measured by the number of larvae developing to the L 3 stage. In the case of AAL, CGL 2 and MOA lectin, doses as low as 5 μg/ml caused > 95 % inhibition of larval development while 40 μg/ml were needed to achieve the same inhibition by CCL 2 lectin. MOA was the only lectin tested that caused larval death while other <b>toxic</b> <b>lectins</b> had larvistatic effect manifesting as L 1 growth arrest. Using lectin histochemistry we demonstrate that of all lectins tested, only the four toxic ones displayed binding to the larvae's gut and likewise were found to interact with glycans localized to the gastrodermal tissue of adults. CONCLUSION The results of our study suggest a correlation between the presence of target glycans of lectins in the digestive tract and the lectin-mediated toxicity in Haemonchus contortus. We demonstrate that binding to the structurally conserved glycan structures found in H. contortus gastrodermal tissue by the set of fungal lectins has detrimental effect on larval development. Some of these glycan structures might represent antigens which are not exposed to the host immune system (hidden antigens) and thus have a potential for vaccine or drug development. Nematotoxic fungal lectins prove to be a useful tool to identify such targets in parasitic nematodes...|$|E

We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection, axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin</b> Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice, infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment.

The numerous microglial cells often formed a multilayered 'barrier' encircling the somata of the RCA-poisoned neurons which eventually became totally disorganised. It is postulated that in the course of neuronal degeneration induced by RCA, microglial cells serve to prevent the leakage or diffusion of the <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin</b> from the neuronal somata into the neighbouring neuropil.

After incubation for 26 h, cellular protein synthesis, as measured by incorporation of labeled leucine into acid-insoluble material, was completely inhibited. HeLa cells, which do not possess Fc receptors, were unaffected by the complex. The effect of the complex on protein synthesis of macrophages was prevented by soluble antigen- antibody complexes, but not by the presence of lactose which prevents attachment of the ricin B chain to the cell membrane. The [ricin- antiricin B] complex was attached to red cells, and the resulting complex was incubated with rat Kupffer cells. Cellular protein synthesis ceased after 6 h, and phase contrast microscopy studies showed that the complexes were taken up by the Kupffer cells.

To achieve a stable and robust sensing system the anchor chain length and the density of the assembled carbohydrates on the gold particle surface has been examined to determine the optimal coverage for maximal aggregation with both RCA 120 and Concanavalin A (Con A) lectins. Gold nanoparticles were stabilised with either a thiolated galactose derivative (9 -mercapto- 3, 6 -diaoxaoctyl-ß-D-galactoside) or a thiolated mannose derivative (9 -merapto- 3, 6 -dioxaoctyl-a-D-mannoside), for RCA 120 and Con A respectively, diluted in each instance with varying ratios of a thiolated triethylene glycol derivative. Aggregation was induced with the respective cognate lectin with the reaction monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The results obtained show that a particle surface with at least 7. 5 % galactose is required for aggregation with RCA 120 and 6 % mannose coverage is required for aggregation with Con A. For each lectin the sensitivity of the assay could be controlled by adjustment of the carbohydrate density on the gold nanoparticles, but with differing results. Maximal aggregation with Con A was achieved with a monolayer consisting of 100 % mannose, whereas for RCA 120 maximal aggregation occurred with 70 % coverage of galactose.

Thus, lanceolin and stenodactylin have all the properties of the toxic type 2 ribosomeinactivating proteins (RIPs). Further experiments were conducted in order to clarify the effects of these RIPs in cells. We investigated the cronological relationship between cytotoxic activity, indirectly evaluated as inhibition of protein synthesis, and loss of cell viability in NB 100 cell line. The induction of apoptosis was assessed by determining caspases 3 and 7 levels, which increase 8 - 16 hours earlier than the beginning of protein synthesis inhibition. This suggest that the arrest of protein synthesis is not a central event in the pathway of cell poisoning by RIPs. The high toxicity and the induction of cell death only by apoptosis and not by necrosis in two muscular cell lines (TE 671 and RD/ 18) suggest that lanceolin and stenodactylin may be potential candidates for experimental chemoablation in strabism and blepharospasm.

We further mutagenized AR 10 to isolate high-RA-resistant cell lines AR 100 - 6, AR 100 - 9, and AR 100 - 13, which were resistant to higher doses of RA and ricin (100 - to 1, 000 -fold) than CHO was. The binding of [125 I]ricin to AR 10, AR 100 - 6, AR 100 - 9, and AR 100 - 13 cells was decreased to about 30 % of that of CHO. The internalization of [125 I]ricin in AR 10 cells and in the high-RA-resistant clones was the same. Polyuridylate-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis, using S- 30 extracts from either AR 100 - 9 or AR 100 - 13, was about 100 -fold more resistant to the inhibitory action of RA than when CHO, AR 10, and AR 100 - 6 cells extracts were used.

The polyphenylalanine synthesis assay using the ribosomes constituted from the 60 S subunit of AR 100 - 9 and the 40 S subunit of CHO indicated that the resistant phenotype of AR 100 - 9 cells is due to an alteration of the 60 S ribosomal subunit...|$|R

The action of two RIPs, the catalytic A-chain from the heterodimeric <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin</b> ricin (RTA) and the single-chain RIP pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), which are known to be highly homologous in tertiary structure, was determined on native ribosomes or naked 23 S rRNA containing mutations designed to affect the structure of the GAGA tetraloop. One such mutant rRNA containing G 2663 C, which abolishes the potential tetraloop by disrupting the Watson-Crick base-pair involved in closing it; resulted in a loss of depurination by RTA, but not by PAP. A similar result was observed for mutant G 2661 A. The double mutant C 2658 G + G 2663 C, which restores the tetraloop-closing base-pair but in the reverse orientation, resulted in sensitivity to both PAP and RTA, as in the wild-type. Thus, the tetraloop structure is required for the action of RTA, but not of PAP, and unlike RTA, PAP does not require G at position 2661. RNA containing the G 2664 C mutation, which lies outside the tetraloop, served as a substrate for both PAP and RTA. The comparison of the recognition elements for PAP and RTA was made with naked (deproteinised) rRNA, because RTA does not act on E, coil ribosomes. However, PAP is active on E. coli ribosomes, and {{it was found that the}} action of PAP on ribosomes containing the above mutations paralleled exactly that on the corresponding naked rRNAs. It is concluded that the recognition elements for PAP and RTA differ and may account, at least in part, for the fact that PAP but not RTA catalyses the depurination of E. coli ribosomes.

40|$|Certain {{strains of}} rats infested with the {{nematode}} parasite Nippostrongulus brasiliensis mount vigorous, persistent immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses. In {{the absence of}} parasites, adjuvants such as Bordatella pertussis or Al(OH) 3 are needed to produce IgE responses to soluble antigens. These are short-lived, even in high IgE responder strains. In this study we have produced long-lived IgE responses in both low (Wistar) and high (Brown Norway) IgE responder strains of rats by repeated injections of ricin, a <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin</b> from castor beans, and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), a bee venom protein. Total IgE levels rose from 30 +/- 20 ng/ml to 39, 000 +/- 7500 ng/ml in the Wistar rats compared with an increase from 120 +/- 100 ng/ml to 47, 000 +/- 8000 ng/ml in the Brown Norway rats. An even greater (10 (4) -fold) increase was seen in PLA 2 -specific IgE antibody levels. total and PLA 2 -specific IgE started to fall 6 weeks after treatment was stopped in the Wistar and after 12 weeks in the Brown Norway rats. The duration of the response was 204 and 248 days, respectively. The IgE-enhancing properties of ricin were compared in low, mid (Hooded Lister) and high IgE responder rats. Total IgE and PLA 2 -specific IgE but not IgG antibody (Ab) responses were enhanced in all animals given ricin and PLA 2 but not in animals given ricin or PLA 2 alone. The increase was greater in Wistar rats (48 -fold) than in Brown Norway rats (eightfold) and by Day 24 the levels of both total and PLA 2 -specific IgE in three different strains were indistinguishable. PLA 2 -specific IgE antibody-secreting cells were detected in the spleen at a frequency of 1 : 5000. These results show: (i) that repeated immunization of rats with antigen and ricin produce a very large IgE response which was long-lived; (ii) that this response was indistinguishable in different IgE responder strains of rat; and (iii) that the IgE response declines earlier in low IgE responder strains of rats...|$|R
40|$|Two mouse L cell variant lines (CL 3 and CL 6) {{selected}} for {{resistance to the}} <b>toxic</b> plant <b>lectin</b> ricin were restricted {{in their ability to}} replicate the two alphaviruses Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus. CL 3 cells have been shown to exhibit increased CMP-sialic acid:glycoprotein sialyltransferase and GM 3 synthetase activities, whereas CL 6 cells have been shown to contain decreased UDPgalactose:glycoprotein galactosyltransferase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activities. The adsorption of Sindbis virus to CL 6 cells was considerably reduced, suggesting that the loss or inaccessibility of the receptors for Sindbis virus accounted for a major defect in virus production in these cells. In contrast, CL 3 synthesized Sindbis viral RNA and proteins but were unable to convert the precursor glycoprotein PE 2 to the structural protein E 2. The cleavage of PE 2 to E 2 was also blocked in both CL 3 and CL 6 cells infected with Semliki Forest virus...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} heterodimeric plant {{proteins}} {{consisting of a}} carbohydrate-binding B-chain and an enzymatic A-chain which act on ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis are amongst the most toxic substances known. The best known {{example of such a}} <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin</b> is ricin, produced by the seeds of the castor oil plant, Ricinnus communis. For ricin to reach its substrate in the cytosol, it must be endocytosed, transported through the endomembrane system to reach the compartment from which it is translocated into the cytosol, and there avoid degradation making it possible for a few molecules to inactivate {{a large proportion of the}} ribosomes and hence kill the cell. Cell entry by ricin involves the following steps: (i) binding to cell-surface glycolipids and glycoproteins bearing beta- 1, 4 -linked galactose residues through the lectin activity of the B-chain (RTB); (ii) uptake by endocytosis and entry into early endosomes, (iii) transfer by vesicular transport to the trans-Golgi network; (iv) retrograde vesicular transport through the Golgi complex and into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); (v) reduction of the disulfide bond connecting the A- and B-chains: (vi) a partial unfolding of the A-chain (RTA) to enable it to translocate across the ER membrane via the Sec 61 p translocon using the pathway normally followed by misfolded ER proteins for targeting to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery; (vi) refolding in the cytosol into a protease-resistant, enzymatically active structure; (vii) interaction with the sarcin-ricin domain (SRD) of the large ribosome subunit RNA followed by cleavage of a single N-glycosidic bond in the RNA to generate a depurinated, inactive ribosome. In addition to the highly specific action on ribosomes, ricin and related ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) have a less specific action in vitro on DNA and RNA substrates releasing multiple adenine, and in some instances, guanine residues. This polynucleotide: adeno sine glycosidase activity has been implicated in the general antiviral, and specifically, the anti HIV- 1 activity of several single-chain RIPs which are homologous to the A-chains of the heterodimeric lectins. However, in the absence of clear cause and effect evidence in vivo, such claims should be regarded with caution. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Intraperitoneal {{immunization}} of Hooded Lister rats with a {{soluble antigen}} such as bee venom phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), or ovalbumin (OVA) {{together with the}} <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin,</b> ricin, eliminates a population of early-activated CD 8 + T cells which regulate IgE production. These early-activated CD 8 + T cells are eliminated because they bear increased ricin-binding glycoproteins on their surface. This immunization regimen produces a vigorous and long-lived IgE response. The effect of this treatment on the capacity of splenic T cells to secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and to generate IL- 4 RNA message was assessed. IFN-gamma production by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) - or ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -stimulated splenocytes or purified splenic T cells from animals immunized with antigen and ricin was substantially reduced as compared with animals which were given saline or antigen alone (P < 0. 001 Student's t-test). At {{the height of the}} primary IgE response IFN-gamma production by PHA-stimulated splenocytes was positively correlated with the number of CD 8 + T cells (r = 0. 90, P < 0. 001) and inversely related to the level of serum IgE (r = - 0. 77, P < 0. 020); serum IgE was inversely related to the number of CD 8 + T cells (r = - 0. 92, P < 0. 001). The reduced capacity of spleen cells from ricin and antigen immunized rats to produce IFN-gamma was first seen 7 days after immunization. The fall in the ability of splenocytes to secrete IFN-gamma closely paralleled the rise in serum IgE. IL- 2 was assayed using an IL- 2 -dependent cell line which responded to rat IL- 2 but not IL- 4. Production of IL- 2 by splenocytes taken from rats immunized with ricin+antigen was not significantly different to that produced by comparable cells obtained from animals immunized with antigen alone or saline. However, the levels of IL- 4 mRNA, detected in ionomycin and PMA-stimulated splenocytes using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, were three- to fourfold higher in ricin and antigen immunized animals as compared with control animals. Following boosting with antigen and ricin the levels of IL- 4 message detected increased a further three- to fourfold. These data show that the potentiated IgE response produced by immunization with antigen+ricin is associated with a decreased ability of splenocytes to produce IFN-gamma and an increased capacity to make IL- 4...|$|R
40|$|Ricin, a <b>toxic</b> <b>lectin</b> from {{castor beans}} greatly enhances IgE {{responses}} to bee venom phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) in {{high and low}} IgE responder strains of rat. The increase in IgE {{is accompanied by a}} 60 % {{reduction in the number of}} CD 8 + but not CD 4 + T cells in the spleen. Optimal enhancement of IgE by ricin occurs when it is given at the same time as the antigen or 24 hr later, suggesting that it acts on cells which were activated as a consequence of immunization. Radio ligand-binding studies with 125 I ricin were used to compare the number of ricin binding sites on CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. No difference was seen in either the affinity or the number of receptors for ricin on the CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells of unimmunized rats. In contrast, CD 8 + T cells taken from rats which had been immunized with 10 micrograms of PLA 2 24 hr earlier demonstrated considerably more ricin receptors (3. 9 x 10 (7) +/- 2. 2 x 10 (6) binding sites/cell) than CD 4 + T cells (3. 19 x 10 (6) +/- 1. 08 x 10 (6) binding sites/cell). However the affinity of the receptors for ricin was unchanged. Cytofluorographic analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled ricin confirmed these observations and indicated that increased ricin binding occurred on a subpopulation of CD 8 + T cells. The effect of CD 8 + T cells on IgE regulation was investigated by adoptive transfer. 1 x 10 (8) highly purified (> 98 %) splenic CD 8 + T cells collected from Brown Norway rats 3 days after immunization with 10 micrograms of PLA 2 were adoptively transferred to naive, syngeneic recipients. The IgE antibody response to PLA 2 + A 1 (OH) 3 seen in these animals was reduced by 91 %. Adoptive transfer of CD 4 + T cells from the same donor animals did not induce suppression and nor did adoptive transfer of CD 8 + T cells from animals given both ricin and PLA 2. However, when recipients of CD 8 + T cells taken from rats immunized with PLA 2 were immunized with a different antigen [ovalbumin (OVA) ] and A 1 (OH) 3 the IgE antibody response was also suppressed, although to a lesser extent (66 %). These results show that co-administration of ricin and PLA 2 depletes a subpopulation of ricin-sensitive, early activated CD 8 + T cells and that these CD 8 + T cells are potent suppressors of the primary IgE response...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lectins are {{carbohydrate}} binding proteins {{present in}} most plants, especially seeds and tubers like cereals, potatoes and beans. It is now well established that many <b>lectins</b> are <b>toxic,</b> inflammatory, resistant to cooking and digestive enzymes and present {{in much of}} our food and sometimes cause "food poisoning. " The global pattern of varying prevalence of diseases such as coeliac disease, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, cardiovascular disease and insulin dependant diabetes mellitus, suggests that some dietary factor specific to plant foods could initiate these diseases. Of the food lectins, grain/cereal lectins, dairy lectins and legume lectins {{are the most common}} ones associated with aggravation of inflammatory and digestive diseases in the body and improvement of these diseases and/or symptoms when avoided. Recent research has suggested that these lectins may effectively serve as a vehicle allowing foreign proteins to invade our natural gut defenses and cause damage well beyond the gut, commonly in joints, brain, skin and various body glands. With continued exposure of the gut by these <b>toxic</b> food <b>lectins</b> a persistent stimulation of the body’s defense mechanism in a dysfunctional manner occurs, which manifests as an autoimmune disease. If the lectins in diet are causative in initiating all these diseases, {{it should be possible to}} identify the responsible constituents and modify or remove them so as to make the diet healthier. Here we present a brief account of lectin toxicity research and show how these proteins have become the focus of intense interest for biologists...|$|R
