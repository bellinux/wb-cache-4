5|$|The Prince {{begins his}} quest alone, but is later {{joined by two}} cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey {{at the same time}} as the Prince of Midenhall, they save the Princess of Moonbrooke from Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which is reduced to ruins. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship that allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, {{including}} Alefgard, which is where Dragon Quest took place. There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information. He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create <b>the</b> <b>Charm</b> <b>of</b> Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining <b>the</b> <b>Charm</b> <b>of</b> Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon's castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{music has}} been {{described}} as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.|$|E

25|$|Even {{his most}} hostile {{teachers}} were amazed by his combination of natural gifts.

25|$|Buildings, {{as in many}} of the {{so-called}} plate glass universities, were constructed in a functional modernist style using concrete, although such designs were later derided for lacking <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the Victorian red-brick universities or the ancient and medieval ones. In Bath, there is a particular contrast between the concrete campus and the Georgian style architecture of the World Heritage City of Bath.|$|E

25|$|Saved by the Bell: The New Class ran {{for seven}} seasons and 143 episodes, from 1993 to 2000. The cast was {{constantly}} revolving, with Haskins {{as the only}} constant throughout all seven seasons. By {{the end of the}} series, the show had run out of ideas. The show was not generally well-received, and some today believe that it failed to recapture <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the original series.|$|E
25|$|M. Daphne Kutzer of the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{argues in}} Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes {{lies in the}} {{illustrations}} rather than the text, and that the book (like other nursery rhyme collections) is not a sustained narrative {{but a series of}} short verses. Such collections are typically unified in style and design, but Appley Dapply lacks this unity because the illustrations range {{over a number of years}} in which Potter's style changed significantly.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole area}} is very mountainous, with steep cliffs, many glaciers, and countless waterfalls. It is {{renowned for its}} scenic beauty and <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the small Swiss villages that dot the area. As a result of this, tourism {{is one of the}} main sources of income in the Bernese Oberland. The region also has an {{extensive}} train network as well as many cable cars and funiculars, with the highest train station in Europe at the Jungfraujoch and the longest gondola cableway in the world from Grindelwald to the Männlichen.|$|E

25|$|Earthworm Jim 3D is a {{platform}} game, {{the third in}} the Earthworm Jim series. It is a sequel to Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2, and the first game in the series to not be developed by Shiny Entertainment, as the rights had been sold to Interplay Entertainment, who handed the franchise off to VIS Entertainment. The game suffered a difficult, prolonged development cycle that was repeatedly delayed until it was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows. The game was not received well, with critics claiming that <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the originals was lost, and that despite the long development period, the game still felt sloppy and lacked previously promoted features.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} when his third book was brought out he had retired {{for a short time}} to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, as he tells us, of his {{unprofitable}} attendance to the bigwigs of Rome. For a time he seems to have felt <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (iv. 25) he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos, brothels, market stalls, public houses, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.|$|E
25|$|Since ski trails {{were first}} cut in 1961, Breckenridge Ski Resort {{has made the}} town a popular {{destination}} for skiers. Summer in Breckenridge attracts outdoor enthusiasts with hiking trails, wildflowers, fly-fishing in the Blue River, mountain biking, nearby Lake Dillon for boating, white water rafting, alpine slides, and many shops and restaurants up and down Main Street. The historic buildings along Main Street with their clapboard and log exteriors add to <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the town. Since 1981, Breckenridge hosts the Breckenridge Festival of Film in September. In January {{each year in the}} 21st century there is a Backcountry Film Festival. That is held {{about the same time as}} the Ullr Fest, a week of celebrating snow and honoring the Norse god Ullr. There are many summer activities, including an annual Fourth of July parade.|$|E

25|$|From 1686 to 1689 Frankland {{had held}} his academy at Attercliffe, on the {{outskirts}} of Sheffield. On his return in July 1689 with the academy to Rathmell, Jollie started an independent academy at Attercliffe. The London Presbyterian fund sent him a few students, but none after 1696. By May 1700 he had sent out forty ministers, and had twenty-six in training. Not thirty names of his students are known, but the list includes Thomas Bradbury, Benjamin Grosvenor, D.D., William Harris, D.D. (1675?–1740), John Bowes (1690–1767), Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Thomas Secker (in 1708–9), archbishop of Canterbury, and Nicholas Saunderson, scientist and mathematician. Grosvenor commends the excellence of his discipline and <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> his eloquence, and thinks that his exemplary character compensated for shortcomings in his learning. It appears that mathematical studies were prohibited ‘as tending to scepticism and infidelity,’ but many of the students ‘by stealth made a considerable progress’ in this department. After Jollie's death the academy was continued by John Wadsworth till 1718, and perhaps later.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt proclaims The Winter's Tale as [...] "one of the best-acting of our author's plays", and recalls {{with delight}} {{some of his}} {{favourite}} actors who played the parts, including Sarah Siddons and John Kemble. He notes the incisive psychology of the unfolding of King Leontes's madness, the appealing roguery of Autolycus, and <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> Perdita's and Florizel's speeches, after wondering {{how it could be}} that Pope doubted the authenticity of the play as Shakespeare's.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the critics}} praised the game's [...] "adult humour", showcased through {{numerous}} one-liners and double entendres. Dillon praised <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> the various characters and their personalities built through conversations. Wood also praised the Revolution's [...] "trademark" [...] "light-hearted humour". Both Dillon and Wood, as well as Winstanley, highlighted Joey's witty remarks. Poole called the writing [...] "some of the funniest dialog ever" [...] and the characters [...] "warped" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
