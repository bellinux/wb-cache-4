5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> are a group {{consisting}} of approximately a thousand islands {{that serves as}} home to almost 600,000 people.

In 1976, <b>the</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> won the right to self-government from the British, and declared independence in 1978. The nation fell into a period of civil instability between then and 2003, when Australia led a military force to restore law and order in the country.|$|E

5|$|Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane {{started to}} issue special {{advisories}} {{to support the}} meteorological services of Vanuatu and <b>the</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a cyclone warning.

5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over {{the next few}} days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over {{the next few days}}, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through <b>the</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through <b>the</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands,</b> Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from <b>the</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in <b>the</b> <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islands</b> can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
