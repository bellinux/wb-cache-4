5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
25|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{made my way}} {{to where}} I could see them it was still unclear what was going on. The guardsmen {{themselves}} looked stunned. We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|I {{was told}} he was handing out a few theatre tickets and I didn't suspect {{anything}} because he always looked after the boys.

25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and I {{consider}} it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long.

25|$|In her 1973 book To Take Arms: My Life With the IRA Provisionals, former IRA member Maria McGuire {{described}} her sentiments following the Donegall Street bombing,"I admit at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> did not {{connect with the}} people who were killed or injured in such explosions.

25|$|I was 25 {{years old}} and {{pursuing}} my doctorate in economics when I was allowed to spend six months of post-graduate studies in Naples, Italy. I read the Western economic textbooks and also the more general work of people like Hayek. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> returned to Czechoslovakia, I had {{an understanding of the}} principles of the market. In 1968, I was glad at the political liberalism of the Dubcek Prague Spring, but was very critical of the Third Way they pursued in economics.|$|E
25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E

25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally {{have no reason to}} interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, {{and all of a sudden}} they're together.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
