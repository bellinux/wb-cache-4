40|$|<b>Thiocolchicoside</b> is used {{in humans}} as a myorelaxant drug with {{anti-inflammatory}} and analgesic activity. Recently we established the experimental conditions that allowed the identification of [H- 3]thiocolchicoside binding sites in synaptic membranes of rat spinal cord and cerebral cortex. The pharmacological characterization of these sites indicated that GABA and several of its agonists and antagonists, as well as strychnine, were able to interact with [H- 3]thiocolchicoside binding in a dose-dependent manner and with different affinities. In order to gain more insight into the nature and the anatomical distribution of the binding sites labeled by [H- 3]thiocolchicoside. {{in the present study}} we examined the localization of these sites on parasagittal and coronal sections of the rat brain and spinal cord, respectively, using receptor autoradiography. In the spinal cord an intense signal was observed in the gray matter, with the highest density occurring in the superficial layers of the dorsal horns. Strychnine completely displaced [H- 3] <b>thiocolchicoside</b> binding, whereas GABA only partially removed the radioligand from its binding sites. In the brain, specific binding occurred in several areas and was displaced by both GABA and strychnine. The distribution of [H- 3]thiocolchicoside binding sites in brain sections, however, did not match that found for [H- 3]muscimol. Furthermore, cold <b>thiocolchicoside</b> was not able to completely displace [H- 3]muscimol binding, and showed a different efficacy in the various areas labeled by the radioligand. We conclude that <b>thiocolchicoside</b> may interact with a subpopulation of GABA, receptors having low-affinity binding sites for GABA, Furthermore, the observed sensitivity to strychnine in the spinal cord indicates an interaction also with strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, suggesting that the pharmacological effects of <b>thiocolchicoside</b> {{may be the result of}} its interaction with different receptor populations...|$|E

We now show that the phasic and tonic GABA(A) R-mediated currents recorded from Purkinje cells and granule neurons, respectively, in parasagittal cerebellar slices from adult mate rats were inhibited by TCC in a concentration-dependent manner. The median inhibitory concentrations of TCC for these effects were similar to 0. 15 and similar to 0. 9 mu M, respectively. TCC did not potentiate GABA(B) R-mediated currents in hippocampal slices, suggesting that its muscle relaxant action is not mediated by GABA(B) Rs. Intraperitoneal injection of TCC in rats either alone or in combination with negative modulators of GABAergic transmission revealed convulsant and proconvulsant actions of this drug. Our data, consistent with clinical observations of the epileptogenic effect of this compound, suggest that TCC is a potent competitive antagonist of GABA(A) R functio...|$|E
40|$|A new simple, precise, {{accurate}} and selective RP-HPLC method {{has been developed}} and validated for simultaneous estimation of <b>Thiocolchicoside</b> (THC) and Etodolac (ETO) in tablet dosage form. The method was carried out on a Symmetry C 18 (150 X 4. 6, 5 µ) column with a mobile phase consisting of 0. 02 M KH 2 PO 4 and 0. 003 M K 2 HPO 4 PH adjust 3. 0 with dilute H 3 PO 4, Acetonitrile in the ratio (50 : 50) and flow rate of 1. 0 mL min- 1. The detection was carried out at 254 nm. The retention time for THC and ETO {{were found to be}} 2. 638 and 4. 275 min, respectively. The THC and ETO followed linearity in the concentration range of 1. 0 - 6. 0 μg mL- 1 and 100 - 600 μg mL- 1 with r 2 = 0. 999 and r 2 = 1. 0 respectively. The amounts of both drugs estimated by proposed method were found to be in good agreement with label claim. The developed method was validated for precision, accuracy, sensitivity, robustness and ruggedness. The developed method can be used for routine analysis of titled drugs in combination in tablet formulation...|$|E

A gradient elution of samples performed on Zorbax SB CN 250  mm ×  4. 6  mm, 5  μm column with buffered mobile phase consisting solvent A (5  mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 2. 5) and solvent B (methanol) delivered at flow rate 1. 0  mL/min. For dissolution study, the sink condition has been established from quantitative solubility of TH and DP API in different dissolution medium recommended by USP for immediate release formulation and the optimized dissolution condition was: pH 6. 8 deaerated potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffers, paddle rotation speed 50  rpm and vessel volume 900  mL. Discriminating release of TH and DP achieved more than 96 % of labeled amount over 45  min and drug dissolution was concluded after 60  min. The HPLC method and dissolution test condition were validated to meet requirement for regulatory filling and this validation inferred from specificity, precision, accuracy, linearity and robustness.

40|$|The {{muscle relaxant}} <b>thiocolchicoside</b> (TCC) is {{commonly}} used in clinical practice also for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Several previous studies have proposed that TCC as a competitive antagonist of GABAARs, and in vivo exerts a proconvulsant and convulsant activity in rats and humans. Preliminary data suggest that pre treatment of rats with concentration of lithium {{similar to those found}} in humans under clinical conditions, markedly enhances the convulsant effects of TCC. To better understand the nature of the interaction between lithium and TCC, we performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings of fEPSPs and evaluated the neuronal excitability in rat dentate gyrus (DG) slices. After 6 h of LiCl (1 mM) incubation the I/O responses of fEPSPs were markedly enhanced compared to control. Application of 1 M TCC potentiated fEPSPs with a greater efficacy in slices after LiCl incubation. Patch-clamp recordings in DG granule cells revealed that LiCl incubation enhanced the frequency of mEPSCs and reduced paired-pulse facilitation ratio suggesting an increased probability of glutamate release. Taken together these results indicate that treatment of slices with LiCl increases fEPSP recorded from DG granule cells, and markedly potentiates the effects of TCC. The strong increase of DG neuronal excitability induced by the association of lithium and TCC is consistent with the pharmacological observation of an enhanced convulsant activity in rats and suggests that particular attention should be taken when such drug combination is used in clinical practice...|$|E

Our previous electrophysiological {{studies have}} indicated that TCC is a competitive antagonist of GABAARs, an action that results in a proconvulsant and convulsant activity in rats and humans. Recent preliminary evidence has suggested that pre-treatment of rats with lithium, at concentrations found in humans treated with lithium under clinical conditions, markedly enhances the convulsant effects of TCC. We thus aimed at evaluating the effects of the interaction between lithium and TCC on neuronal excitability in the rat dentate gyrus (DG). Hippocampal slices were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mM LiCl for 6 h, and fEPSP were then recorded. LiCl incubation induced a significant increase of the I/O responses of fEPSPs compared to control conditions. Patch-clamp analysis in DG granule cells revealed that LiCl incubation enhanced the frequency of mEPSCs and reduced paired-pulse facilitation ratio suggesting that lithium increases the probability of glutamate release. Application of 1 uM TCC potentiated fEPSPs with a greater extent in slices incubated with LiCl compared with those with vehicle. These results indicate that treatment of slices with LiCl increases the excitatory postsynaptic responses in DG granule cells, and markedly potentiates the effects of TCC. The strong increase of DG neuronal excitability induced by the association of lithium and TCC is consistent with the pharmacological observation of an enhanced convulsant activity in rats and suggests that some caution should be taken when such drug combination is used in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic prostatitis/chronic {{pelvic pain}} {{syndrome}} (CP/CPPS) {{has been treated}} with several different interventions with limited success. This meta-analysis aims to review all trials reporting on therapeutic intervention for CP/CPPS using the National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the NIDDK website between 1947 and December 31, 2011 without language or study type restrictions. All RCTs for CP/CPPS lasting at least 6 weeks, {{with a minimum of}} 10 participants per arm, and using the NIH-CPSI score, the criterion standard for CP/CPPS, as an outcome measure were included. Data was extracted from each study by two independent reviewers. Gillbraith and I-squared plots were used for heterogeneity testing and Eggers and Peters methods for publication bias. Quality was assessed using a component approach and meta-regression was used to analyze sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Mepartricin, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), and triple therapy comprised of doxazosin + ibuprofen + <b>thiocolchicoside</b> (DIT) resulted in clinically and statistically significant reduction in NIH-CPSI total score. The same agents and aerobic exercise resulted in clinically and statistically significant NIH-CPSI pain domain score reduction. Acupuncture, DIT, and PTNS were found to produce statistically and clinically significant reductions in the NIH-CPSI voiding domain. A statistically significant placebo effect was found for all outcomes and time analysis showed that efficacy of all treatments increased over time. Alpha-blockers, antibiotics, and combinations of the two failed to show statistically or clinically significant NIH-CPSI reductions. CONCLUSION: Results from this meta-analysis reflect our current inability to effectively manage CP/CPPS. Clinicians and researchers must consider placebo effect and treatment efficacy over time and design studies creatively so we can more fully elucidate the etiology and role of therapeutic intervention in CP/CPPS...|$|E
40|$|In {{professional}} road cyclists, {{the majority}} of overuse injuries affect the lower limbs and are mostly represented by contractures or muscle shortening, characterized by an increase of tone and stiffness and a variation of elasticity. Treatment and prevention of these specific conditions may include physical, supplementary, and pharmacologic support. The aim of this real-life study was to determine: first, the alterations of tone, stiffness, elasticity, and soreness of rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) in top class cyclists engaged in 3 multistage races, and second, whether any variable {{in the management of}} the athletes may affect the prevention and/or reduction of such alterations. Twenty-three professional cyclists competing in 3 international, cycling stage races were assessed. Athletes could receive, upon the approval of the medical staff, physical, dietary, and/or pharmacological management which could include treatments with topical over-the-counter myorelaxants to prevent and/or reduce muscle contractures. MyotonPro was used to daily measure tone, stiffness, and elasticity in RF and BF in relaxed and contracted state after every stage. In parallel, BF and RF soreness was also assessed with a Likert scale. All athletes received the same general massage management; none of them received dietary supplements; some of the athletes were treated with a topical myorelaxant <b>thiocolchicoside</b> (TCC 0. 25 %) foam 3 times daily. TCC was identified as the only variable able to affect these muscle parameters in the cyclists. Tone, stiffness (regardless of the state), and soreness significantly increased over time either in BF or RF in all athletes. In the group of athletes that used TCC (n =  11; TCC+) the increase in tone, stiffness, and soreness was significantly lower than in the group not receiving TCC (n =  12; No-TCC). Elasticity varied coherently with tone and stiffness. A very intense and protracted sport activity increases muscular tone, stiffness, and soreness over time. Topical TCC foam significantly attenuates these alterations and might represent an efficient strategy both to prevent and manage contractures and their consequences in professional cyclists as well in athletes from other disciplines involving similar workloads...|$|E
