5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> Unknown and Astounding, {{there was a good}} deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E

5|$|Oslac's origins {{are unclear}} and no {{specific}} relationship with any previous known figure {{can be established}} from available sources. Oslac's name suggests to some historians {{that he was a}} Norseman. Dorothy Whitelock points out that the name Oslac is often an anglicisation of the Old Scandinavian name Áslákr, while <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> the Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain entry on Oslac comment that the name suggests an origin in the Danelaw, a suggestion supported by the fact that Thored, Oslac's son, held lands in Cambridgeshire.|$|E
5|$|Scholars cannot {{tell from}} records whether <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> the time, {{when using the}} term Tonto Apache, were {{referring}} to Yavapai or Apache, or those mixed bands. In addition, the Europeans often referred to the Wi:pukba and Guwevkabaya incorrectly as the Yavapai Apache or Yuma Apache. The Europeans referred to the Ɖo:lkabaya, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (who belonged to the Upland Yuma Peoples), as Yuma Apache or Mohave Apache.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), her boss; and the distractions <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> TGS face when writing sketches. This becomes evident when Liz's assistant, Cerie (Katrina Bowden), wears sexually suggestive clothing; and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) learns that working for Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the main star of TGS, is more than he expected.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be funny if the plant went on strike. <b>The</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> Saturday Night Live {{clashed with}} Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches. Henson felt {{they were trying to}} write for {{situational}} comedy rather than staying within his intended story. Frank Oz eventually agreed the partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they moved on to The Muppet Show.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{brief period}} when the episode had a {{different}} subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening {{had been told by}} a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. <b>The</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.|$|E

The chief character in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't, in fact, {{either of the}} magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and {{to add to the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Cast members Lisa Edelstein, Jesse Spencer and Hugh Laurie {{submitted}} the episode for Primetime Emmy Awards {{on their behalf}}. In the categories Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Edelstein), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (Spencer) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Laurie). Peter Blake, David Foster, Russel Friend, Garrett Lerner and Doris Egan, <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> the episode, {{submitted the}} episode on their behalf for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The episode was also given up for consideration in the category Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series on behalf of director Greg Yaitanes. Hugh Laurie and Greg Yaitanes' submissions both came through as nominations. Yaitanes won the award, but Laurie lost the award to Bryan Cranston for his performance in AMC's Breaking Bad.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Jack tells Liz and <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> TGS Tracy Jordan that {{he wants}} them to insert General Electric (GE) {{products}} into the show. The writers express their reluctance in doing product placements for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great Snapple's White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees on the condition that Jack appears in the sketch. The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that he repeatedly forgot his lines after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with the sketch, which he ultimately is able to shoot.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Newman is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Created and introduced by William J. Bell, {{he was born}} onscreen in 1988 as the second child of supercouple characters Victor and Nikki Newman. Portrayed {{by a set of}} twins and later two child actors for his first six-year period, <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> the series decided to rapidly age the character to a teenager in the summer of 1994. That June, Joshua Morrow began portraying Nick, and has remained in the role to present time. The character was reintroduced with the purpose of developing a relationship with another character, Sharon Collins, who was introduced around the same story arc. The pairing, which yielded three children, Cassie, Noah and Faith Newman, proved popular with viewers. They are regarded as a prominent supercouple by the soap opera media.|$|E
5|$|The area {{in which}} the Flanders family's beach house is located in is based on the Cape Cod peninsula. Many of <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> The Simpsons spent time on Cape Cod so they decided to model the new {{locations}} on it. The animators looked at Cape Cod photographs to get inspiration for the episode, and one of the show's background designers, Lance Wilder, grew up in that area. The beach house is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire, to which the writers had visited many times. They played several board games when they were there, which gave them the idea to have to the Simpson family play the Mystery Date board game in the episode. Silverman said that the episode was difficult to animate and direct because it had so many new and detailed backgrounds and completely different locations.|$|E
