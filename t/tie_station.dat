50|$|KSWO-TV {{presently}} broadcasts 26½ {{hours of}} locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours on weekdays and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); {{in regards to}} the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the Wichita Falls-Lawton market's broadcast television <b>stations,</b> <b>tied</b> with NBC affiliate KFDX-TV and beating KSWO's CBS-affiliated sister station KAUZ-TV's weekly news total by a half-hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{affiliation}} with UPN {{ushered in a}} new era for WUPA. With a stronger signal and the syndicated shows it had acquired from WGNX, the station became a factor in the Atlanta ratings for the first time ever. The station's viewership would surpass that of WATL and even WTBS. For most of UPN's run, WUPA was the network's fourth strongest <b>station</b> (<b>tied</b> with Charlotte, North Carolina's WJZY {{by the end of the}} network's run).|$|R
50|$|Because {{there was}} no local {{programming}} during on the networked shows and not enough local news on the breakfast and drivetime shows, Total Star Bath along with its sister stations in Warminster and Swindon (who were the owners of One Gold Radio Ltd) decided to break <b>ties</b> with sister <b>station</b> Total Star Gloucestershire from June 2011, which was under the ownership of Storm Radio Ltd. All Total Star stations in Wiltshire and Bath were re-branded as More Radio.|$|R

5000|$|The 1989 sale of WXRI to Win Communications severed CBN's <b>ties</b> to the <b>station</b> and {{prompted}} the station's callsign {{to change to}} WZCL. The Christian format initially moved to 96.1 WKSV, which received CBN's tape library, hired most of its former DJs and even considered changing its calls to WXRI. Meanwhile, on May 19, {{after a period of}} stunting everything from rock and roll to beautiful music, the new WZCL became [...] "Cool 105" [...] with an oldies format.

50|$|KWVA began {{broadcasting}} in 1993. But {{the start}} of student radio at the University of Oregon began long before. Students and faculty worked together {{in the operation of}} KWAX, which was operated out of the UO Department of Speech. It served as an academic laboratory providing daily services for the campus and community from studios in Villard Hall. In the 1970s, KWAX affiliated with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, hired a dedicated professional staff and affiliated with NPR. Two years later, the university cut its academic <b>ties</b> with the <b>station</b> and by the early 1980s there were no students involved at KWAX. KWAX moved off campus and turned into the classical music station that it continues to be today.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was closely}} <b>tied</b> with sister <b>station</b> CIHF-TV in Halifax. Both {{shared the same}} branding, MITV (Maritimes Independent Television), and their {{schedules}} were almost identical. However, the stations offered separate newscasts to their respective provinces and opportunities for advertisers to buy ad space on one or both stations. Furthermore, despite the New Brunswick station's rebroadcaster-like callsign, the stations were separately licensed by the CRTC. At the time, MITV was the only over-the-air independent television station in the area, with studios and main operation centre in Halifax, and all other functions in Saint John. As MITV shared owners with CHSJ-TV, a popular joke in the Maritimes was that MITV stood for [...] "More Irving Television".|$|R
5000|$|WHND {{picked up}} {{competition}} {{from a number}} of FM oldies stations during the late 1980s, including WKSG (102.7), CKLW-FM (93.9) and WOMC (104.3), with WOMC eventually coming to dominate in the format. As the station became a virtually invisible presence on the Detroit radio dial, the station dropped its local programming and switched to Satellite Music Network's [...] "Kool Gold" [...] format. On December 2, 1994, [...] "Honey Radio" [...] came to an end, as Greater Media began to broker time on the station to local Spanish-language broadcasters. On April 1, 1996, WHND changed its calls to WLLZ, picking up the calls dropped by Detroit's 98.7 FM after its change from Rock to Smooth Jazz as WVMV. The format remained brokered Spanish. Finally, in June 1997, Greater Media sold AM 560 to Crawford, who changed the format to Christian Talk as [...] "AM 560, The WMUZ Word Station" [...] (not IDing with the call letters, but with a positioner <b>tying</b> the <b>station</b> to Crawford's flagship contemporary Christian FM, WMUZ-FM 103.5). The WLLZ calls were changed to WRDT on August 11, 2003. The station remained AM Stereo even {{after the end of the}} oldies format.|$|R

The station's 5:00, 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts also placed first {{in their respective}} time slots; while its prime time newscast on KCWE placed second in the 9:00 p.m. time slot, slightly ahead of the KCTV-produced newscast on KSMO but well behind WDAF-TV, which has led the 9:00 p.m. hour since shortly after its switch to Fox and the related launch of its prime time newscast in September 1994.|$|R
40|$|A planned {{function}} of the Space Station is to refurbish and refuel an advanced space-based LO 2 /LH 2 orbit transfer vehicle. An alternative to propellant storage at the station {{is to use a}} remote facility <b>tied</b> to the <b>station</b> with a log tether. Preliminary design of such a facility is described with emphasis on fluid transfer and storage requirements. Using tether lengths of at least 300 ft, gravity gradient forces will dominate surface tension in such a system. Although gravity given transfer is difficult because of line pressure drops, fluid settling over the tank outlet greatly alleviates acquisition concerns and will facilitate vented tank fills. The major concern with a tethered orbital refueling facility is its considerable operational complexity including transport of the OTV to and from the facility...|$|R
50|$|Hrib pri Koprivniku was a Gottschee German village. It {{was first}} {{settled in the}} 14th century. In 1574 the village had six full farms divided into 12 half-farms with 24 landowners and 75 to 85 inhabitants. In 1770 there were 32 houses in the villages. Before the Second World War the village had 40 houses and a {{population}} of 152. The economy of the village was based on farming, selling beech firewood, charcoal burning, beekeeping, and transporting railway <b>ties</b> to the <b>station</b> in Črnomelj. Italian forces burned all 40 houses in the village {{in the summer of}} 1942. In mid-November 1944 the Partisan Fran Levstik Brigade and an assault battalion surrounded and annihilated a detachment of German and Home Guard troops in the village. Today the site of the former village is registered as cultural heritage.|$|R
40|$|The Keystone network {{developed}} {{around the}} Tokyo metropolitan area {{consists of four}} stations each of which deploys VLBI and SLR observation systems. The VLBI systems have been operational for three years, whereas the SLR systems are in the engineering test stage and have only produced {{a small amount of}} preliminary range data. Using the SLR data obtained between February and May, 1998, the station coordinates were firstly solved by our orbit analysis software, CONCERTO, and then compared with the VLBI results. The positions of four VLBI antennas were determined using the 34 m VLBI antenna at Kashima whose coordinates are listed in the ITRF 96. Those of four SLR stations were estimated by orbit analysis, fixing the coordinates of other global stations to the ITRF 96. After the correction of local <b>ties,</b> the global <b>station</b> coordinates from the two space geodetic techniques were compared; there were less than 15 mm difference in the vertical components and less than 50 mm difference in the horizontal components...|$|R

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} relative gravity measurements carried out in Kellyville and Kangerlussaq (Greenland) in July 2013. They were performed during the absolute gravity measurements with the FG 5 X- 216 from the University of Luxembourg in Kellyville. This station was established by NGS/NOAA in 1995. Absolute gravity measurements have been repeated several times but irregularly. René Forsberg kindly provided us with the gravity station descriptions from the National Gravity Net.

We are grateful to René Forsberg for his kind and friendly cooperation. 1. Vertical Gravity Gradient The Vertical gravity gradient was measured at the outdoor absolute gravity site in Kellyville. We measured the gravity differences between three different levels (0. 260 m, 0. 861 m and 1. 263 m) above the benchmark (Figure 1). We obtained a linear vertical gravity gradient of- 3. 316 ± 0. 012 microGal/cm...|$|R
40|$|The {{positions}} of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter were {{obtained in the}} VLBI radio reference frame by measuring {{the position of a}} satellite (natural or artificial) of each planet relative to an extragalactic source in the radio catalogue. From the results for Mars and Venus it is concluded that the offset in right ascension of the radio frame from the dynamical equinox defined in DE 200 is 0. 00 sec +/- 0. 04 sec. The observations for Jupiter imply a correction to its position from DE 200 of - 0. 18 sec +/- 0. 04 sec in right ascension and - 0. 06 +/- 0. 05 sec in declination on 1983 April 29. The right ascension of Jupiter relative to the inner planets has been measured independently using Doppler tracking data near Jupiter encounter from Pioneers 10 and 11 and from Voyagers 1 and 2 by <b>tying</b> the tracking <b>station</b> positions, through previous spacecraft missions, to the DE 200 ephemerides of the inner planets. This technique yielded a correction to Jupiter's right ascension of - 0. 22 +/- 0. 05 sec, in good agreement with the results from the direct radio measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The Doctor, Bill and {{an angry}} Nardole {{travel in the}} TARDIS to follow a {{distress}} call to a deep-space mining station. When the TARDIS is jettisoned by the station's computers, the trio are forced to wear [...] "smartsuits", robotic spacesuits capable of independent operation <b>tied</b> to the <b>station.</b> The suits are also {{the only source of}} oxygen, as the mining company does not provide an oxygen atmosphere inside the station, and every activity is measured in breaths. The surviving crew warn them that some suits have received instructions to [...] "deactivate" [...] their [...] "organic components", killing the wearer via an electrical discharge but remaining autonomous. This signal can be carried by touch, which has caused most of the crew to be turned into zombies, enslaved to the suits' programming. The Doctor and the others plan to walk outside the station to an uncompleted portion not updated in the computer systems to hide. Bill's suit malfunctions during depressurisation and forces her to remove her helmet. To save her, the Doctor gives her his helmet as they spacewalk. He survives the vacuum of space, but has gone blind from the ordeal.|$|R
40|$|In {{standard}} combination approaches (e. g., for the International Terrestrial Reference Frame), the space-geodetic {{techniques are}} connected by the Earth rotation parameters {{and by the}} station coordinates at co-located sites, using the so-called local ties. These local ties are usually derived from terrestrial measurements together with GNSS measurements for linking to a global reference system. The local ties often differ from the coordinate differences derived from space-geodetic observations. However, the sources for the discrepancies are not always clear, and a validation within the combination is difficult {{as long as the}} local ties are needed for the combination. We provide an alternative combination method by using the co-location of GNSS and SLR observations onboard GNSS satellites. As the local ties {{do not need to be}} applied in this approach, the resulting station coordinates are consistently estimated, but independent of the local ties. This allows us to evaluate the agreement of the terrestrial local ties and the space-geodetic coordinate differences derived from a 12 -years solution. The 61 colocations investigated in a multi-year solution show an agreement better than 1 cm in the horizontal and height components for 41 and 27 co-locations, respectively. Co-locations showing big discrepancies can be explained by the shortness of the data set included, or the rare distribution over the time span. Only the co-location site San Fernando shows unexplained differences of several centimeters. When using satellite co-locations, the counterpart of local <b>ties</b> at <b>stations</b> are space <b>ties</b> at satellites. The offsets of the microwave satellite antenna form one component of the space tie, with the offset of the laser retro-reflector array (LRA) forming the second part. We show that corrections to the space ties can be estimated from combined GNSS-SLR solutions. The corrections to the LRA offsets are only 5 – 6 mm, whereas the corrections estimated for the microwave antennas can exceed 1 dm, with a mean correction of - 86. 1 mm and - 110. 4 mm for GPS and GLONASS, respectively...|$|R
