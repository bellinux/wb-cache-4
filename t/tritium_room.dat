40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system to}} provide tertiary containment at Mound has been upgraded {{to support a}} new multi-room tritium handling facility. This system is used to remove <b>tritium</b> from <b>room</b> air {{in the event of}} primary (process) and secondary (glovebox) containment failure. The upgraded system includes a faster response time, piping and valves that are more leaktight, and a new control panel that better indicates the system status and operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|When a {{radioactive}} material gas is accidentally released with a room, the present of the hazardous gas will directly affect the people safety inside. In this study, the flow field and gas dispersion in a ventilated <b>tritium</b> storage <b>room</b> at Los Alamos National Laboratory was simulated using CFX- 5. 5, a commercially available CFD package using a finite volume methodology. CFD models provide a simultaneously numerical solution of continuity, Navier-Stokes, and energy equations for a flow field geometry with specified boundary conditions. CFX- 5 uses a coupled solver, which solves the hydrodynamic equations (for u, v, w, p) {{as a single}} system. This reduces the number of iterations required for convergence to a steady state, and to a transient analysis solution for each time step in time-dependant gas dispersion as well...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring the {{breathing}} air in <b>tritium</b> facility <b>rooms</b> for airborne <b>tritium</b> is a radiological safety requirement and a best practice for personnel safety. Besides audible alarms for room evacuation, these monitors often send signals for process shutdown, ventilation isolation, and cleanup system actuation to mitigate releases and prevent tritium {{spread to the}} environment. Therefore, these monitors are important not only to personnel safety but also to public safety and environmental protection. This paper presents an operating experience review of tritium monitor performance on demand during small (1 mCi to 1 Ci) operational releases, and intentional airborne inroom tritium release tests. The tritium tests provide monitor operation data to allow calculation of a statistical estimate for the reliability of monitors annunciating in actual tritium gas airborne release situations. The data show a failure to operate rate of 3. 5 E- 06 /monitor-hr with an upper bound of 4. 7 E- 06, a failure to alarm on demand rate of 1. 4 E- 02 /demand with an upper bound of 4. 4 E- 02, and a spurious alarm rate of 0. 1 to 0. 2 /monitor-yr...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of the recently developed b-ray-induced x-ray spectrometry (BIXS) for nondestructive measurements of tritium captured in matrix was investigated using zirconium as a model sample. Two distinct spectra from characteristic and bremsstrahlung x-rays were clearly observed for the Zr sample exposed to <b>tritium</b> gas at <b>room</b> temperature. The former x-rays showed a sharp intense peak, while the latter x-rays formed a broad continuous spectrum. The intensity of both peaks decreased sharply with vacuum heating. At the same time, {{the top of the}} bremsstrahlung x-ray peak shifted to the higher energy side. These results indicate that the absorbed tritium diffused into the bulk by heating in vacuo. The changes were analyzed by computer simulation. The computer simulation could reproduce the observed spectra quite well. BIXS is therefore thought to be a highly promising technique for nondestructive determination of tritium inventories and depth profiles in materials...|$|R
40|$|Tritium {{retention}} in boron-coated graphite (B/Graphite) irradiated with <b>tritium</b> ions at <b>room</b> {{temperature and}} at high temperatures was examined by beta-ray-induced X-ray spectrometry (BIXS). The {{results of analyses}} by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for an unirradiated sample suggested that boron coated on the graphite surface formed an amorphous structure and that it contained impurities such as oxygen and carbon. Both a sharp intense peak and a broad weak peak induced by beta-rays appeared in the observed X-ray spectra. It was seen from the X-ray spectra that most of tritium implanted into the B/Graphite at room temperature was retained {{on the surface and}} in subsurface layers. In addition, it was seen that the implanted tritium can be easily removed at a relatively low temperature and that the retention amount decreased to 1 / 3 by heating at 300 ゜C for 30 min. However, a considerable increase in tritium retention was observed when the irradiation temperature was increased to more than 300 C, indicating adsorption of tritium on the bare surface graphite...|$|R
40|$|Retention {{behavior}} of tritium by stainless steel exposed to plasmas in the Large Helical Device (LHD) {{has been studied}} by �-ray-induced X-ray spectrometry (BIXS) and an imaging plate (IP) technique. Plasma-exposed stainless steel samples were prepared by exposing the small plates {{at the location of}} 6. 5 L in LHD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also applied to analyze deposition layers on the surface of a sample. XPS analyses showed that the deposition layers contain B, C, O and Ti as well as constituent elements of stainless steel. Chemical form of metallic elements was mainly oxides, but a part was metallic state. The plasma-exposed sample was exposed to tritium gas along with a bare stainless steel plate for comparison. The BIXS and IP measurements showed that the tritium retention largely increased by plasma exposure and it strongly depended on sample temperatures during vacuum heating and tritium exposure. In addition, it was seen from the IP images that non-uniform tritium distribution on the surface was formed even <b>tritium</b> exposure at <b>room</b> temperature...|$|R
40|$|An {{emergency}} tritium removing system, using {{a precious}} metal/alumina catalyst, {{was designed and}} constructed in order to decontaminate tritium leaked accidentally into laboratory rooms. The performance of thee system was examined using a balloon for helium recovery or an aluminum vessel as a substitute of a laboratory <b>room.</b> <b>Tritium</b> gas containing about 10 % tritiated methane (CH 3 T) as an impurity was introduced into the experimental room and then removed with an air flow rate of 72 m 3 /h. Tritium gas (T 2) was removed satisfactorily, i. e. the reaction probability was unity, due to a Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (Nippon Jun Suiso Co. Ltd) at 200 ℃, while the tritiated methane could not be removed with a sufficient amount of efficiency: its reaction probability was below unity. It {{was found that the}} reaction probability of the tritiated methane became unity above 300 ℃ for this catalyst. On the basis of these results, it is estimated that the accidental leakage of tritium of 5 Ci (which is the maximum permissible amount used in a day in this laboratory) into a laboratory room can be removed within an 18 h period...|$|R
40|$|To {{close the}} JET tritium {{material}} balance a comprehensive programme {{to determine the}} tritium inventory in a selected poloidal set of JET tiles was initiated. First results strongly suggest that a significant fraction of the tritium remaining in the machine is immobilised in flakes accumulated in the sub-divertor region. Measurements performed with tiles and flakes retrieved from JET after the DTE 1 campaign revealed a chronic <b>tritium</b> release at <b>room</b> temperature, possibly caused by, a radiation-induced mechanism. Deposited films {{of the order of}} 5 mum thick are found at the vertical surfaces of the inner divertor. Recent analysis of the distribution of beryllium across the divertor shows factors of approximate to 10 higher beryllium concentrations (relative to carbon) in these deposits than found in the main camber walls. Very little beryllium is found on the outer divertor. Also no beryllium is detectable in the thick deposits accumulated in the shadowed regions of the inner divertor. These results suggest that in ITER migration of beryllium from the main chamber to the divertor surfaces could substantially reduce the chemical erosion and consequently the retention of tritium.

40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} amount of {{adsorption}} and/or adsorption states of tritium in various materials is of great importance to the development of safety handling systems free from the serious contamination of tritium gas. The amount of tritium adsorbed on materials has been usually measured by an apparatus isolated from the tritium gas exposure system. Therefore, the amount of tritium observed deviates from the original value because of desorption into the ambient atmosphere and its reaction with atmospheric components. From this viewpoint, we developed a measuring system equipped with a small detector attached directly to the tritium exposure system, and examined performance if the system. The detector employed in the present counting device was a hemispherical G-M tube covered with a tungsten mesh in place of a thin mica window. The efficiency of the present counting device was remarkably affected by absorption of β-rays in the working gas (mixture of helium and 1 % isobutane) and its geometrical configuration. These effects on the observed counting rate were checked by using a polymer source labeled with tritium. As a result, the efficiency significantly decreased with the absorption ofβ-rays in the working gas rather than {{as a result of its}} geometrical configuration. From the absorption curve, it was determined that the absorption coefficient of β-rays was 2. 16 cm- 1 for the ambient gas. From these results, the overall efficiency (F) was shown as F=exp(- 2. 46 h), where h is the distance from the sample surface to the detector. The practical examination was carried out by using small nickel and iron plates exposed to <b>tritium</b> gas at <b>room</b> temperature. A great difference in the amount of adsorbed tritium between both metal samples was clearly recognized irrespective of the small surface areas less than 1 cm 2. In addition, the results showed that the present counting device could measure the coverage less than 10 - 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the current status of the {{development}} of the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) Facility at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Designated a National User Facility by the US DOE, the primary mission of STAR is to provide laboratory infrastructure to study tritium science and technology issues associated with the development of safe and environmentally friendly fusion energy. Both tritium and non-tritium fusion safety research is pursued along three key thrust areas: (1) plasma-material interactions of plasma-facing component (PFC) materials exposed to energetic tritium and deuterium ions, (2) fusion safety concerns related to PFC material chemical reactivity and dust/debris generation, activation product mobilization, and tritium behavior in fusion systems, and (3) molten salts and fusion liquids for tritium breeder and coolant applications. STAR comprises a multi-room complex with operations segregated to permit both tritium and non-tritium activities in separately ventilated <b>rooms.</b> <b>Tritium</b> inventory in STAR is limited to 15, 000 Ci to maintain its classification as a Radiological Facility. Experiments with tritium are typically conducted in glovebox environments. Key components of the tritium infrastructure have been installed and tested. This includes the following subsystems: (1) a tritium Storage and Assay System (SAS) that uses two 50 -g depleted uranium beds for tritium storage and PVT/beta-scintillation analyses for tritium accountability measurements, (2) a Tritium Cleanup System (TCS) that uses catalytic oxidation and molecular sieve water absorption to remove tritiated species from glovebox atmosphere gases and gaseous effluents from experiment and process systems, and (3) tritium monitoring instrumentation for room air, glovebox atmosphere and stack effluent tritium concentration measurements. Integration of the tritium infrastructure subsystems with the experimental and laboratory process systems is planned for early in 2004. Following an operational readiness review, tritium operations will be initiated in the summer of 2004. Summary results of the performance testing of the tritium infrastructure subsystems and their integration into the laboratory operations will be presented at this conference. Current research activity includes plasma-material interaction studies with the Tritium Plasma Experiment (TPE) and tritium/chemistry interactions in the molten salt designated as Flibe (2 ·LiF-BeF 2). The implementation of these capabilities in STAR will be described...|$|R
