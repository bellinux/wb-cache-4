2500|$|The {{graphics}} chip, VIC-II, features 16 colors, eight hardware sprites per scanline (enabling up to 112 sprites per PAL screen), scrolling capabilities, and two bitmap graphics modes. The standard <b>text</b> <b>mode</b> features 40 columns, {{like most}} Commodore PET models; the built in character encoding is not standard ASCII but PETSCII, an extended form of ASCII-1963. The kernel ROM sets the VIC-II {{to a dark}} blue background on power up with a light blue text and border. Unlike the PET and VIC-20, the C64 uses [...] "fat" [...] double-width text as some early VIC-IIs had poor video quality {{that resulted in a}} fuzzy picture. Most screenshots show borders around the screen, which is a feature of the VIC-II chip. By utilizing interrupts to reset various hardware registers on precise timings it was possible to place graphics within the borders and thus use the full screen.|$|E

2500|$|Most Windows {{text files}} use [...] "ANSI", [...] "OEM", [...] "Unicode" [...] or [...] "UTF-8" [...] encoding. What Windows {{terminology}} calls [...] "ANSI encodings" [...] are usually single-byte ISO/IEC 8859 encodings (i.e. ANSI in the Microsoft Notepad menus is really [...] "System Code Page", non-Unicode, legacy encoding), except for in locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean that require double-byte character sets. ANSI encodings were traditionally used as default system locales within Windows, before {{the transition to}} Unicode. By contrast, OEM encodings, also known as DOS code pages, were defined by IBM [...] {{for use in the}} original IBM PC <b>text</b> <b>mode</b> display system. They typically include graphical and line-drawing characters common in DOS applications. [...] "Unicode"-encoded Windows text files contain text in UTF-16 Unicode Transformation Format. Such files normally begin with Byte Order Mark (BOM), which communicates the endianness of the file content. Although UTF-8 does not suffer from endianness problems, many Windows programs (i.e. Notepad) prepend the contents of UTF-8-encoded files with BOM, to differentiate UTF-8 encoding from other 8-bit encodings.|$|E
2500|$|The C64 uses an 8-bit MOS Technology 6510 microprocessor. This {{is a close}} {{derivative}} of the 6502 with an added 6-bit internal I/O port that in the C64 is used for two purposes: to bank-switch the machine's read-only memory (ROM) {{in and out of}} the processor's address space, and to operate the datasette tape recorder. The C64 has [...] of RAM, of which 1024× ½ bytes are color RAM for <b>text</b> <b>mode</b> and [...] are available to built-in Commodore BASIC 2.0 on startup. There is [...] of ROM, made up of the BASIC interpreter, the kernel, and the character ROM. As the processor could only address [...] at a time, the ROM was mapped into memory and only [...] of RAM (plus 4KB between ROMs) were available at startup. Most [...] "breadbox" [...] Commodore 64s used 4164 DRAM, with eight chips to total up 64k of system RAM. Late breadbox models and all C64Cs used 41464 DRAM (64kx4) chips which stored 32KB per chip, so only two were required. Since 4164 DRAMs are 64kx1, eight chips are needed to make an entire byte and the computer will not function without all of them present. Thus the first chip contains Bit 0 for the entire memory space, the second chip contains Bit 1, and so forth. This also makes detecting faulty RAM easy as a bad chip will display random characters on the screen and the character displayed can be used to determine the faulty RAM.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} interesting, {{if it were}} feasible, {{to point out the}} epoch at which the <b>text</b> <b>mode</b> of arguing in polemic {{controversy}} became predominant; I mean by single texts without any modification by the context. I suspect that it commenced, or rather that it first became the fashion, under the Dort or systematic theologians, and during the so called Quinquarticular Controversy. This quotation from St. Paul is a striking instance:--for St. Paul is speaking of the holy spirit of which true spiritual Christians are partakers, and by which or in which those Christians are enabled to search all things, even the deep things of God. No person is here spoken of, but reference is made to the philosophic principle, that can only act immediately, that is, interpenetratively, as two globules of quicksilver, and co-adunatively. Now, perceiving and knowing were considered as immediate acts relatively to the objects perceived and known:--'ergo', the 'principium sciendi' must be one (that is, homogeneous or consubstantial) with the 'principium essendi quoad objectum cognitum'. In order therefore for a man to understand, or even to know of, God, he must have a god-like spirit communicated to him, wherewith, as with an inward eye, which is both eye and light, he sees the spiritual truths. Now I have no objection to his calling this spirit a 'person,' if only the term 'person' be so understood as to permit of its being partaken of by all spiritual creatures, as light and the power of vision are partaken of by all seeing ones. But it is too evident that Sherlock supposes the Father, as Father, to possess a spirit, that is, an intellective faculty, by which he knows the Spirit, that is, the third co-equal Person; and that this Spirit, the Person, has a spirit, that is, an intellective faculty, by which he knows the Father; and the 'Logos' in like manner relatively to both. So too, the Father has a 'logos' with which he distinguishes the 'Logos';--and the 'Logos' has a 'logos', and so on: that is to say, there are three several though not severed triune Gods, each being the same position three times 'realiter positum', as three guineas from the same mint, supposing them to differ no more than they appear to us to differ;--but whether a difference wholly and exclusively numerical is a conceivable notion, except under the predicament of space and time; whether it be not absurd to affirm it, where interspace and interval cannot be affirmed without absurdity--this is the question; or rather it is no question.|$|E

50|$|On Linux and DOS {{systems with}} so named SVGA cards, {{a program called}} SVGATextMode is used to set up better looking <b>text</b> <b>modes</b> than EGA and VGA {{standard}} ones. This is particularly useful for large (≥ 17") monitors, where the normal 80&times;25 VGA <b>text</b> <b>mode's</b> 720&times;400 pixel resolution is far lower than a typical graphics mode would be. SVGATextMode allows setting of the pixel clock and higher refresh rate, larger font size, cursor size, etc., and allows a better use of the potential of a video card and monitor. In non-Windows systems, the use of SVGATextMode (or alternative options such as the Linux framebuffer) to obtain a sharp text is critical for LCD monitors of 1280×1024 (or higher resolution) because none of so named standard <b>text</b> <b>modes</b> fits to this matrix size. SVGATextMode also allows a fine tuning of video signal timings.|$|R

5000|$|... 80&times;25 {{characters}} {{in up to}} 16 colors. Each character is again an 8&times;8 dot pattern (the same character set is used as for 40&times;25), in a pixel aspect ratio of 1:2.4. The effective screen resolution of this mode is 640&times;200 pixels. Again, the pixels cannot be individually addressed. Since there are twice as many characters on the screen in this mode, the card has enough video RAM for just four different <b>text</b> pages.
