He is also collaborating with other researchers to develop a device to deliver antiepileptic drugs directly to the brain to treat seizures.|$|E
50|$|Abbott did {{initially}} {{embrace the}} drug enthusiastically after its U.S. launch in 1998, and provided further clinical studies {{with the goal}} of gaining FDA approval for monotherapy in epilepsy.

50|$|To {{minimize}} epileptic seizures {{in these}} people, {{it is important}} to find an anti-convulsant medication that does not disrupt a person's sleeping structure. The anti-convulsant medications that were tested to meet this criteria are: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, ethosuximide, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, vigabatrin, <b>tiagabine,</b> levetiracetam, zonisamide, and oxcarbazepine. Oxcarbazepine is shown to have the least amount of adverse effects on sleep. Another study shows that it enhances slow wave-sleep and sleep continuity in patients with epilepsy.|$|E
5000|$|Lacosamide is an {{anticonvulsant}} compound {{approved for}} the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures and neuropathic pain. Clinical trials are currently underway {{for the use}} of lacosamide as monotherapy for partial onset seizures. [...] There is no evidence that lacosamide provides additional value over current AEDs for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, but it may offer a safety advantage. [...] Newer AEDs, including lacosamide, vigabatrin, felbamate, gabapentin, <b>tiagabine,</b> and rufinamide {{have been found to be}} more tolerable and safer than older drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate.|$|E
50|$|Valproic acid is {{the first}} line drug choice for {{reducing}} generalised seizures and myoclonus. Levetiracetam is also effective for both generalised seizures and myoclonus. Clonazepam and high-dose piracetam can alleviate myoclonus. Phenytoin can worsen seizures and may speed up neurodegeneration; carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, <b>tiagabine,</b> vigabatrin, gabapentin and pregabalin may worsen myoclonus and myoclonic seizures. Other common medications to treat ULD include topiramate and zonisamide. If an individual with Unverricht-Lundborg disease is particularly sensitive to {{a certain type of}} stimulus, it is also beneficial to reduce the patient's exposure to that stimulus {{in order to reduce the}} likelihood of seizures. Since ULD is progressive and may not get better over time, depression has been documented in many cases, so providing a strong support group of friends, family, and even other individuals with ULD is very beneficial.|$|E
50|$|Based on anecdotal evidence, {{the drugs}} of choice are those {{used for other}} {{idiopathic}} generalized epilepsies. Valproate alone, or most probably in combination with clonazepam, levetiracetam, lamotrigine or ethosuximide, {{appears to be the}} most effective regimen. The choice of the second drug depends on the main seizure type. Clonazepam is highly efficacious in eyelid myoclonia and myoclonic jerks. Of the newer antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam may be the most effective, because of its anti myoclonic and anti photosensitive properties. Lamotrigine is very effective in absence seizures but may exaggerate myoclonic jerks. Contra-indicated drugs are: Carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, pregabalin, <b>tiagabine</b> and vigabatrin. Lifestyle and avoidance of seizure precipitants are important. Non-pharmacological treatments used for photosensitive patients (such as wearing special glasses or the newly commercially available blue Z1 lenses) should be employed in Jeavons syndrome when photosensitivity persists.|$|E
50|$|Anticonvulsants are {{the most}} {{successful}} medication in reducing and preventing seizures from reoccurring. The goal of these medications {{in being able to}} reduce the reoccurrence of seizures {{is to be able to}} limit the amount of rapid and extensive firing of neurons so that a focal region of neurons cannot become over-activated thereby initiating a seizure. Although anticonvulsants are able to reduce the amount of seizures that occur in the brain, no medication has been discovered to date that is able to prevent the development of epilepsy following a head injury. There are a wide range of anticonvulsants that have both different modes of action and different abilities in preventing certain types of seizures. Some of the anticonvulsants that are prescribed to patients today include: Carbamazepine (Tegretol), Phenytoin (Dilantin Kapseals), Gabapentin (Neurontin), Levetiracetam (Keppra), Lamotrigine (Lamictal), Topiramate (Topamax), <b>Tiagabine</b> (Gabitril), Zonisamide (Zonegran) and Pregabalin (Lyrica).|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: <b>Tiagabine</b> is {{a unique}} {{antiepileptic}} drug with a novel mechanism of action. Whilst some limited data are available as to the peripheral blood pharmacokinetics of <b>tiagabine,</b> data regarding the kinetics of <b>tiagabine</b> in the central brain compartment are very limited. We therefore sought to investigate serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and frontal cortex and hippocampal extracellular fluid (ECF) kinetic inter-relationship of <b>tiagabine</b> in a freely moving rat model. Methods: Adult male rats were implanted with either a jugular vein catheter and a cisterna magna catheter for blood and CSF sampling, respectively, or a blood catheter and a microdialysis probe in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (for ECF sampling). <b>Tiagabine</b> was administered intraperitoneal (i. p.) at 20 or 40 mg/kg and blood, CSF and ECF were collected at timed intervals for the measurement of <b>tiagabine</b> concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography. Results: <b>Tiagabine</b> concentrations in blood and CSF rose linearly and dose-dependently and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was 15 and 29 min, respectively. Mean CSF/serum <b>tiagabine</b> concentration ratios (range, 0. 008 – 0. 01) were {{much smaller than the}} mean free/total <b>tiagabine</b> concentration ratios in serum (0. 045 ± 0. 003). Entry of <b>tiagabine</b> into brain ECF (frontal cortex and hippocampus) was rapid with Tmax values of 31 – 46 min. Distribution of <b>tiagabine</b> in brain was not brain region specific with values in the frontal cortex and hippocampus being indistinguishable. Whilst elimination from CSF was comparable to that of serum, half-life (t 1 / 2) values in ECF were three times longer. Conclusions: <b>Tiagabine</b> is associated with linear kinetic characteristics and with rapid brain penetration. However, CSF concentrations are not reflective of free non-protein-bound concentrations in serum. The observation that <b>tiagabine</b> elimination from the brain is threefold slower than that seen in blood, may explain as to the relatively long duration of action of <b>tiagabine...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractEpilepsy remains {{difficult}} to treat {{with more than}} 30 % of patients being refractory to conventional anticonvulsant therapy.

Twenty consecutive patients with refractory epilepsy were treated with <b>tiagabine,</b> and prior to <b>tiagabine</b> administration the mean number of anticonvulsants that each patient had taken was five. <b>Tiagabine</b> therapy was initiated at a dose of 5 or 10 mg per day and was increased at weekly increments of 5 or 10 mg per day, respectively. Thirty-five percent of patients receiving <b>tiagabine</b> (20 – 40 mg per day, mean 34. 29 mg per day) achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in seizure frequency. <b>Tiagabine</b> was effective when added to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or oxcarbazepine. <b>Tiagabine</b> appeared more effective at higher doses. Side effects were predominately central nervous system-related, the most common being dizziness. For optimal results, <b>tiagabine</b> should be initiated at low doses and titrated slowly.

40|$|<b>Tiagabine</b> {{is a new}} {{generation}} antiepileptic drug, a specific inhibitor of gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA) reuptake from the synaptic space to neurons and glia. Central effect of ethanol is mainly connected with its effect on GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic and opioid transmission. The mechanism of <b>tiagabine</b> effect suggests that it may alleviate the rewarding effect of ethanol, which can be applied {{in the treatment of}} addiction. There are only a few studies discussing interactions of <b>tiagabine</b> and ethanol. In this study we have decided to examine interaction of ethanol with <b>tiagabine</b> by the use of pharmaco-EEG method. The influence of <b>tiagabine</b> on the effect of ethanol on EEG of rabbits (midbrain reticular formation, hippocampus, frontal cortex) was tested. <b>Tiagabine</b> was administered at a single dose (5 and 20 mg/kg) (po) or repeatedly twice a day at a total dose of 5 mg/kg for 14 days. Ethanol was injected (iv) at a dose of 0. 8 g/kg 60 min after <b>tiagabine</b> treatment. Ethanol caused an increase in the slow frequencies (0. 5 – 4 Hz) in the recording, as well as a marked decrease of the fastest frequencies (30 – 45 and 13 – 30 Hz in cortex). <b>Tiagabine</b> leads to changes in rabbit EEG-recording suggesting their depressant-effect on the central nervous system (CNS) (increase in slow and decrease in fast frequencies). They are less pronounced after repeated doses, which may indicate the adaptative changes in the receptors. A single dose of <b>tiagabine</b> markedly increases the effect of ethanol on rabbit EEG, which indicates a synergistic inhibitory effect of these agents on the CNS.

40|$|Background: Saccadic eye {{velocity}} (SEV) {{has been}} shown to be a reliable neurophysiological tool for the assessment of gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA(A) receptor sensitivity. Administration of benzodiazepines targeting the GABA(A) receptor decreases SEV in healthy volunteers. <b>Tiagabine</b> is a new antiepileptic drug which acts via selective blockade of GABA reuptake. Therefore, we examined the effects of <b>tiagabine</b> on saccade parameters. Methods: SEV was analyzed in 8 healthy volunteers before and after 7 days of <b>tiagabine</b> treatment. Subjects received <b>tiagabine</b> in a daily dose of 15 mg. Saccades were measured using a noninvasive infrared oculographic device. Amplitude, latency, and SEV were analyzed as a function of treatment and target eccentricity. Results: SEV and saccade latency increased with target amplitude. Treatment with <b>tiagabine</b> had no significant effect on SEV and saccade amplitude. A trend was found for increased latencies after <b>tiagabine.</b> Conclusion: In contrast to findings with benzodiazepines, <b>tiagabine</b> treatment had no impact on SEV in healthy volunteers. The subchronic tolerance effects or the different site of action on the GABA(A) /BZD receptor complex may account for this deviating profile. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel. ...|$|E
40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, incoordination, and shortened life-span, and by huntingtin inclusions and neurodegeneration. We previously screened the 1040 FDA-approved compounds from the NINDS compound library {{and found that}} a compound, nipecotic-acid, significantly reduced mutant huntingtin aggregations and blocked cell toxicity in an inducible cell model of HD. Because nipecotic-acid does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we studied its analogue, <b>tiagabine,</b> which is able to cross the BBB, in both N 171 - 82 Q and R 6 / 2 transgenic mouse models of HD. <b>Tiagabine</b> was administered intraperitoneally at 2 and 5 mg/kg daily in HD mice.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} review of <b>tiagabine,</b> including its pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, efficacy, adverse effects, and dosing recommendations. DATA SOURCES: A computerized search of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to December 1997 was used to identify publications related to <b>tiagabine</b> and nipecotic acid derivatives. Included in this review was information gathered from scientific meetings. Manufacturer’s information was used when there was no primary literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: <b>Tiagabine</b> amplifies γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its mechanism of action is selective and has shown promise as an antiepileptic drug (AED) in patients with seizures refractory to other pharmaceutical products. <b>Tiagabine</b> exhibits dose-independent absorption, 90 – 95 % bioavailability, high protein binding (96 %), metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P 450 enzymes (CYP 3 A subfamily), and displays first-order elimination pharmacokinetics. The mean plasma half-life is 5 – 8 hours. Concomitant medications that induce hepatic metabolism enhance <b>tiagabine</b> elimination; metabolism is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Adverse events of <b>tiagabine</b> typically involve the central nervous system, have been mild to moderate in intensity, and also have been transient in nature. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Tiagabine</b> has demonstrated a good safety profile and, while it has not been demonstrated to be superior to other second-line AEDs for partial seizures, its safety and select mechanism of action warrant its further evaluation in the clinical setting. <b>Tiagabine</b> should be a good alternative add-on agent for patients with unsatisfactory seizure control or intolerable adverse effects of traditional therapies; thus, this agent should be made available to these patients...|$|E

40|$|Objective Glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{are the key}} {{neurotransmitter}} {{systems in}} the cortical-thalamocortical network, involved in normal and pathologic oscillations such as spike-wave discharges (SWDs), which characterize different forms of absence epilepsy.

Herein, we {{examined the effects of}} two selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of mGlu 1 and mGlu 5 receptors, the GABA reuptake inhibitor, <b>tiagabine,</b> and their interaction in the somatosensory cortex and thalamus on SWDs in WAG/Rij rats. Methods Male WAG/Rij rats were equipped with bilateral cannulas in the somatosensory cortex (S 1 po) or the ventrobasal (VB) thalamic nuclei, and with cortical electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. Rats received a single dose of the mGlu 1 receptor PAM, RO 0711401, or the mGlu 5 receptor PAM, VU 0360172, various doses of <b>tiagabine,</b> or VU 0360172 combined with <b>tiagabine.</b> Results Both PAMs suppressed SWDs regardless of the site of injection. <b>Tiagabine</b> enhanced SWDs when injected into the thalamus, but, unexpectedly, suppressed SWDs in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the cortex. Intracortical co-injection of VU 0360172 and <b>tiagabine</b> produced slightly larger effects as compared to either VU 0360172 or <b>tiagabine</b> alone. Intrathalamic co-injections of VU 0360172 and subthreshold doses of <b>tiagabine</b> caused an antiabsence effect similar to that exhibited by VU 0360172 alone in the first 10 min.
