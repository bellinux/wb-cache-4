25|$|Starting in December 1959, {{the fully}} {{automatic}} train was tested on the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train {{was equipped with}} a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals. At each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers. The relays controlled the starting of the train, the acceleration, braking, and stopping of the train, {{as well as the}} opening and closing of the car doors. The relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a punched tape. When operating at full speed, the train operated at 30 miles per hour, and the train slowed to 5.5 miles per hour when coming into the two stations. When entering stations, the train passed through a series of detectors, which caused a series of <b>tripper</b> arms at trackside to go into the open position if the train was going at the speed. If the train was going too quickly, the <b>tripper</b> arms would stay upright and the train's brakes would automatically be set.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of a}} {{demonstration}} for automation, Track 4 was briefly automated from 1962 to 1964. It was the first automated service in the New York City subway system. Starting in December 1959, the fully automatic train was tested on the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train was equipped with a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals.

The equipment was built and installed by the General Railway Signal Company and the Union Switch and Signal division of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, after several years of research and development. The NYCTA contributed between $20,000 to $30,000 on the project, while the bulk of it, between $250,000 and $300,000, was contributed by the two companies. The automation of the shuttle was opposed {{by the president of the}} Transport Workers Union, Michael J. Quill, who pledged to fight the project and called the device [...] "insane." ...|$|E
