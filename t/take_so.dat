5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to <b>take</b> <b>so</b> hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} {{increased}} water flow in Kitchen Creek, {{which has been}} cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that Kitchen Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow. As Kitchen Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become {{similar to those of}} other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could <b>take</b> <b>so</b> long that a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.|$|E

25|$|Mehmed {{successes in}} the East {{prompted}} him to launch a new campaign against Skanderbeg. He prepared by sending 23,000 cavalry under Sinan bey near Albania. Upon learning this, Skanderbeg gathered 8,000 men to march against Sinan. Skanderbeg figured out what route Sinan would <b>take</b> <b>so</b> he chose to encamp in a mountain overlooking the path, near Mokra, marching there by night before the Ottomans. On 7 July 1462, the Ottomans neared and Skanderbeg ordered his men to make loud noises by using their drums and battlehorns and they soon launched a powerful attack. Disorder engulfed the Ottoman ranks and many were cut down. The Albanians gathered rich booty and traveled back to Albania heavy-laden.|$|E
25|$|After Henry {{departed}} from Rome in 1111 a council had declared {{the privilege of}} lay investiture, which had been extorted from Paschal, to be invalid. Guido, Archbishop of Vienne, excommunicated the emperor, calling upon the pope to ratify this sentence. Paschal, however, refused to <b>take</b> <b>so</b> extreme a step. The quarrel entered a new stage in 1115 when Matilda of Tuscany died, leaving her vast estates to the papacy. Crossing the Alps in 1116, Henry won {{the support of the}} town and nobles by granting privileges to the one and giving presents to the other. But Jordan, Archbishop of Milan, excommunicated him at San Tecla. He took possession of Matilda's lands and was gladly received in Rome. By this time Paschal had withdrawn his consent to lay investiture, and the excommunication had been published in Rome, but the pope was compelled to flee from the city. Some of the cardinals withstood the emperor, but by means of bribes he broke down the opposition and was crowned a second time by Maurice Bourdin, Archbishop of Braga, who was to become Antipope Gregory VIII.|$|E

In 1903, an Iowa newspaper noted: [...] "It was due to his zeal in organization, his success in persuading students to enter the competitive contests, and his skill in drilling them, that has enabled Michigan to <b>take</b> <b>so</b> high a rank in oratory in these league contests, with seven first honors to her credit in ten years, and nine of the twelve victories in debate." ...|$|E
500|$|In late September or October 1629, Baltimore {{arrived in}} Jamestown, where the Virginians, who {{suspected}} him of designs {{on some of}} their territory and vehemently opposed Catholicism, gave him a cool welcome.

After {{no more than a}} few weeks in the colony, Baltimore left for England to pursue the new charter, leaving his wife and servants behind. In early 1630 he procured a ship to fetch them, but it foundered off the Irish coast, and his wife was drowned. Baltimore described himself the following year as [...] "a long time myself a Man of Sorrows".|$|E

Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can <b>take</b> <b>so</b> much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{newspaper}} pieces about the K Foundation appeared in The Guardian the following Monday, correctly {{pointing out that the}} shortlist and exhibition were actually for the 1993 Turner Prize, the controversial £20,000 annual award given by the UK art establishment to the best young contemporary artist, but assuming that the K Foundation prize was a hoax. [...] "As for the K Foundation", the newspaper wrote, [...] "it stands unmasked as the current performing face of those cherished old friends of pop pranksterdom, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty", formerly known as The KLF. In September, the organisers of the Turner Prize responded publicly that [...] "It proves the validity of our prize that somebody would <b>take</b> <b>so</b> much trouble to set up this award".|$|E

500|$|In 1985 Michael Bloom of The Boston Phoenix {{wrote that}} Cheap at Half the Price [...] "will {{never get the}} hearing it deserves". He said that Frith was trying to shake off this [...] "progressive" [...] mould he had been cast in, and {{believed}} that the songs on the album should be judged on their own merit and not as [...] "rarefied art rock". One 1984 reviewer found the album [...] "a very enjoyable recording", and stated that Frith's music [...] "is changing the way many musicians look at the sounds that they <b>take</b> <b>so</b> seriously". The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock described Cheap at Half the Price as Frith's response to punk, a low-tech approach to performing songs. It called the album a [...] "twisted pop" [...] record, {{saying that it is}} [...] "as uncompromising as everything else Frith recorded". François Couture in a review of Frith's 2002 album, Prints called Cheap at Half the Price [...] "the best tongue-in-cheek take at the New Wave".|$|E
500|$|In January 1838, Smith, Elder & Co. advertised {{the first}} part of Darwin's geology book, Geological {{observations}} on volcanic islands and coral formations, as a single octavo volume to be published that year. By {{the end of the month}} Darwin thought that his geology was [...] "covering so much paper, & will <b>take</b> <b>so</b> much time" [...] that it could be split into separate volumes (eventually Coral reefs was published first, followed by Volcanic islands in 1844, and South America in 1846). He also doubted that the treasury funds could cover all the geological writings. The first part of the zoology was published in February 1838, but Darwin found it a struggle to get the experts to produce their reports on his collections, and overwork led to illness. After a break to visit Scotland, he wrote up a major paper on the geological [...] "roads" [...] of Glen Roy. On 5 October 1838 he noted in his diary, [...] "Began Coral Paper: requires much reading".|$|E
500|$|In July 1935, Le Mesurier {{was hired}} by the Oldham {{repertory}} company, based at the Coliseum Theatre; his first appearance with them was in a version of the Wilson Collison play, Up in Mabel's Room; he was sacked after one week for missing a performance after oversleeping. In September 1935, he moved to the Sheffield Repertory Theatre to appear in Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, and also played Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Le Mesurier later commented on the slow progress of his career: [...] "had I known it was going to <b>take</b> <b>so</b> long, I might well have given the whole thing up". In 1937 he joined the Croydon Repertory Theatre, where he appeared in nine productions in 1936 and 1937. During this period Le Mesurier changed his professional name from John Halliley to John Le Mesurier; his biographer Graham McCann observes that [...] "he never bothered, at least in public, to explain the reason for his decision". Le Mesurier used his new name {{for the first time in}} the September 1937 production of Love on the Dole.|$|E

Titley stated that he could [...] "no longer tolerate the shifting of the Parliament lock, stock and barrel to Strasbourg one week a month...It's a miserable journey and it's always a problem" [...] noting the problems in lost luggage. As well as undermining the EU's climate change objectives, he criticises the Strasbourg sessions as the deals have already been made leading to them becoming formal voting sessions padded out with [...] "debates saying we are against sin." [...] Titley also states that, because the journeys <b>take</b> <b>so</b> much time, the committees in Brussels who do the bulk of the work do not have sufficient time to work. Titley {{is not the only one}} to leave over the issue; Eluned Morgan MEP is standing down in 2009 for similar reasons, notably due to the toll the moving has on time with her family, and former MEP Simon Murphy quit as leader of the Socialists in 2002 due to the inconvenience of the arrangement.|$|E
500|$|In the south, however, Olympic's {{victory over}} one of the great amateur teams {{provoked}} consternation. [...] At the time, The Football Association (the FA), the sport's governing body, prohibited clubs from paying their players. [...] Despite this, working-class clubs, especially those based in Lancashire, had been widely suspected of making illicit payments to players since at least 1876. [...] In the wake of Olympic's high-profile victory, journalists and officials affiliated with southern amateur clubs intensified their calls for the FA to investigate the finances of northern clubs. They focussed in particular on Olympic's training excursion to Blackpool, suggesting that the players {{would not have been able}} to <b>take</b> <b>so</b> much time off work unless the club was paying them some form of wage. [...] Questions were also asked about players who had relocated from one town to another seemingly for the sole purpose of playing for a new football team. [...] In Olympic's case Jack Hunter had moved from Sheffield to join the club. [...] Ultimately no action was taken against Olympic, although punishments were imposed on other clubs, including Preston North End, who were expelled from the FA Cup. [...] This in turn prompted the northern clubs to make plans to break away from the FA and form a rival governing body which would not impose the so-called [...] "amateur ideal" [...] on clubs.|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her.

I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot <b>take</b> <b>so</b> long..." ...|$|E
