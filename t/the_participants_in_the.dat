On September 25, a rematch took place at Clash of Champions, where Fox was defeated. After suffering a streak of losses, Fox scored a victory over Dana Brooke on the November 4 episode of Superstars.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Participation {{in regular}} {{physical}} activity is important for individuals with a mobility disability to decrease risk of chronic disease, improve quality of life, and maintain and improve functional ability. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for programs that can facilitate the adoption and maintenance of {{regular physical activity}} for adults with a mobility disability. Purpose: To pilot test a physical activity centered education (PACE) program for individuals with a mobility disability. Methods: A case study approach was adopted and consisted of two participants with a mobility disability, one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support and one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awareness group. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group completed the 8 -week (1 90 minute session/week) PACE program <b>in</b> person at <b>the</b> Health Promotion for People with Disabilities Lab. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awareness group was mailed the PACE materials and completed the program independently at home. Thus, the primary between group differences was the intensity and type of support provided for physical activity adoption. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> each group completed pre, and post assessments, with <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group completing an additional follow-up assessment measuring: (1) amount of weekly physical activity (self-report), (2) self-efficacy to be active, and (3) barriers to physical activity. Finally, after <b>the</b> follow-up assessment, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group completed an interview to evaluate the program. ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis of quantitative data was calculated and was reported in frequencies and percentage change over time. Qualitative data was analyzed using a cross-case analysis to identify themes and conceptual patterns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> responses. RESULTS: Both <b>participants</b> reported a decrease <b>in</b> barriers faced. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group reported decreased physical activity and increased self-efficacy whereas, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awareness group reported increased physical activity and decreased self-efficacy. During the follow-up interview, five themes were identified including (1) PA knowledge, (2) PA participation, (3) PA expectations, (4) Program participation, and (5) Program feedback. CONCLUSION: The findings from this case study were mixed between amount of activity completed, barriers faced, and self-efficacy. However, these results are difficult to interpret due to a confounding health factor (spinal stenosis) faced by <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group that likely impacted all outcome measures. Through the program evaluation, suggested program adjustments included improving program applicability by including community specific information, incorporating personalized activity plans, and providing practical examples of adapted activities of daily living and exercises...|$|R

On November 22, 2003, Brewer was among <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> historic 2003 Heritage Classic ice hockey game versus the Montreal Canadiens at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton.

Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the Chicago Blackhawks, Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001–02 NHL season, a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.|$|E

Two weeks later on Raw, Benoit retained the World Heavyweight title in a scheduled match against Shawn Michaels, after interference by Triple H.

Prior to Raw that night, Bischoff informed Triple H that he would face Benoit for the World title the following week on Raw.

Tommy then works for Ricardo Diaz (Luis Guzmán), who hires him as protection. Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised the ambush. With the help of Lance Vance (Philip Michael Thomas), whose brother died in the ambush, Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and {{distance himself from the}} Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina (Danny Trejo) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner in the drug trade. Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker (Lee Majors), leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.|$|E

5|$|The bokuseki style {{developed}} from Song Dynasty calligraphy. It was brought from China to Japan, together with Zen Buddhism, starting with Eisai in 1191. Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries. Later bokuseki {{became part of}} the zen practice and served as meditation help. They were often mounted on hanging scrolls, and displayed in temples and tea rooms. The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Rikyū considered them crucial to the tea ceremony {{in the sense that they}} put <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right frame-of-mind. Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods.

Qualifying matches occurred to determine <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match at WrestleMania, starting on that night's Raw with Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy defeating Snitsky and Val Venis respectively to qualify. Shelton Benjamin became the third participant when he defeated Jimmy Wang Yang on the following episode of SmackDown.

At a non-televised SmackDown/ECW house show held on March 8, Montel Vontavious Porter qualified when he defeated Jamie Noble.
