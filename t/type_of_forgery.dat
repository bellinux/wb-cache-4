50|$|A cliché forgery {{is a type}} of {{counterfeit}} coin (a subtype of fourrée) produced using a genuine coin to impress a design into silver foil. The resulting obverse and reverse impressions are then soldered together around a copper or other metal core. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>forgery</b> is particularly suitable to the manufacture of small, thin coins. Counterfeits of this type have been found both from Classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Unlike most fourrée coins, the technique does not require a press and counterfeit dies in order to manufacture the forgeries.|$|E
5000|$|Gold is denser {{than almost}} all other metals, hence hard to fake. A {{determination}} of weight and volume {{is in many}} cases sufficient to spot forgeries. A coin that is not gold or below the expected fineness will either have the right size but will a lower than expected weight or it weighs right and will be somewhat larger. Most metals that are of similar or higher density than gold are similarly or more expensive, and were unknown in ancient times (notably the platinum group). During the 19th century platinium was cheaper than gold and was used for counterfeiting gold coins. These coins could be detected by acoustic properties. Only two relatively inexpensive substances are of similar density to gold: depleted uranium and tungsten. Depleted uranium is government-regulated, but tungsten is more commonly available and suited for counterfeiting. Alloying gold with tungsten would not work for several reasons, but tungsten plated with {{a thin layer of}} gold is a common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>forgery.</b>|$|E

In copy move forgery, a specific area is copied and then pasted into any other region of the image.

40|$|Standard {{signature}} schemes {{are usually}} designed only to achieve weak unforgeability – i. e. preventing forgery of signatures on new messages not previously signed. However, most signature schemes are randomised and allow many possible signatures {{for a single}} message. In this case, {{it may be possible}} to produce a new signature on a previously signed message. Some applications require that this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>forgery</b> also be prevented – this requirement is called strong unforgeability. At PKC 2006, Boneh Shen and Waters presented an efficient transform based on any randomised trapdoor hash function which converts a weakly unforgeable signature into a strongly unforgeable signature and applied it to construct a strongly unforgeable signature based on the CDH problem. However, the transform of Boneh et al only applies to a class of so-called partitioned signatures. Although many schemes fall in this class, some do not, for example the DSA signature. Hence it is natural to ask whether one can obtain a truly generic efficient transform based on any randomised trapdoor hash function which converts any weakly unforgeable signature into a strongly unforgeable one. We answer this question in the positive by presenting a simple modification of the Boneh-Shen-Waters transform. Our modified transform uses two randomised trapdoor hash functions. 15 page(s...|$|E

The {{most common type of}} image tampering is cloning, or Copy-Move Forgery (CMF), in which part(s) of the image are copied and pasted back into the same image. One possible transformation is where an object is copied, rotated and pasted; this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>forgery</b> is called Copy-Rotate-Move Forgery (CRMF). Applying post-processing can be used to produce more realistic doctored images and thus can increase the difficulty of forgery detection.

A new method has been developed to segment the Copy-Move objects in a consistent way that is more efficient than Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) segmentation for CMF/CRMF. We propose a new method to describe irregular shaped blocks (segments). The Segment Gradient Orientation Histogram (SGOH), is used to describe the gradient distribution of each segment. The quality of initial matches is improved by applying hysteresis to grow the primary detection regions.
