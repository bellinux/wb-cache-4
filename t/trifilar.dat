40|$|Accurate {{calculation}} of the moment of inertia of an irregular body is made difficult by {{the large number of}} quantities which must be measured. A popular method is to use a <b>trifilar</b> suspension system to measure the period of oscillation of the body in the horizontal plane. In this paper, some sources of error are discussed with particular attention given to the alignment of the test object’s center of mass on the <b>trifilar</b> platform. The procedure is described, the necessary calculations are derived and the relative importance of accuracy in different measurements is assesed. It is determined that the accurate alignment of the centre of mass of the body being tested with the centre of the <b>trifilar</b> plate is insignificant compared to the accuracy of the other measurements required in the calculations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This brief {{presents}} a novel CMOS Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) receiver with an ultralow power consumption, {{which is based}} on the injection-locking technique for short-range wireless systems. Additionally, through reducing the oscillation current amplitude of the injection-locked oscillator, the GFSK receiver sensitivity is significantly improved. While comprising a submilliwatt low-noise amplifier, a <b>trifilar</b> trans-former splitter, and an injection-locked self-oscillating mixer, the proposed receiver is fabricated using a 90 -nm CMOS 1 P 9 M tech-nology. Measurement results indicate a sensitivity of − 81 dBm, with a power consumption of 1. 8 mW, when a Bluetooth GFSK signal with a data rate of 1 Mb/s is received.

40|$|Monofilar, bifilar, <b>trifilar</b> and quadrifilar Archimedean spiral {{metamaterial}} {{particles are}} analyzed by using point group symmetry {{and the methods}} of crystallography. From the symmetry properties electromagnetic response is determined. Magnetic, electric and magnetoelectric modes of the particles are identified along with their isotropy characteristics. Theoretical methods show that all the particles, except monofilar spiral, are non-bianisotropic. Numerical simulation results are presented to verify the analysis. Finally, effective medium theory is applied to extract the effective permeability of the spiral medium.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{benefits}} of Schottky diodes, 0. 18 - m CMOS technology is being promoted for millimeter wave applica-tions. In this paper, 60 -GHz dual-conversion down-/up-converters using Schottky diodes are realized by using 0. 18 - m foundry CMOS technology. A CoSi –Si Schottky diode, fabricated on a lower doped N-well by blocking the threshold voltage ad-justment implant, has a lower reverse leakage current and a better ideality factor. Thus, it is ideal for the 60 -GHz sub-har-monic mixer design. Two new types of Schottky-diode mixers, a down-conversion sub-harmonic mixer with a dual-band lump-dis-tributed phase-inverter rat-race coupler and an up-conversion sub-harmonic mixer with a <b>trifilar</b> transformer, are realized and employed at the high-frequency conversion stage of the dual-conversion architecture to achieve small size and broadband isolations. The silicon-based Schottky diode with a low turn-on voltage offers great advantage in LO pumping power, especially for an antiparallel diode pair structure. In our Schottky-diode sub-harmonic mixers, the required LO power is only 1 dBm. The dual-conversion down-converter achieves 5 -dB conversion gain and 19 dB noise figure under and mA, and the dual-conversion up-converter, with and mA, attains greater than 40 -dB sideband rejection and 1 dB conversion gain over the whole 60 -GHz bandwidth.

40|$|The inertia {{properties}} of an engine to be mounted on complex mechanical systems (e. g., cars, boats, etc.) are usually evaluated {{by considering the}} engine like a rigid-body (RB). These properties are mainly employed to design the geometry and the stiffness of the engine support, so as to build the dynamic model of the mechanical system the engine has to be mounted on. In this paper, two different techniques for measuring the RB inertia properties are compared: one in the time domain {{and the other in}} the frequency domain. The time-domain technique is based on the measurement of the oscillation period of a <b>trifilar</b> pendulum. In this context an ad hoc calibration procedure has been implemented in order {{to improve the quality of}} the results. On the other hand, the frequency-domain technique is based on the measurement of the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the softly suspended RB. These techniques are applied to estimate the RB inertia properties both of an engine block and of a marine diesel engine. Eventually, their pros and cons are highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Improvements in {{rehabilitation}} and prosthetic design {{are needed to}} help promote activities such as running that increase physical activity levels of individuals with lower extremity amputation (ILEA). However, effectively developing these improvements requires a detailed understanding of prosthetic and ILEA running biomechanics. Running-specific prostheses (RSPs) {{have been developed to}} improve running performance for ILEA runners, but altered running kinetics may still be necessary to accommodate for the loss of musculoskeletal function caused by lower extremity amputation. The few studies investigating ILEA running with RSPs focus on maximal performance, but our understanding of how ILEA using RSPs modulate kinetics to run at submaximal velocities remains limited. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize changes in kinetics and mechanical energy across a range of running velocities in ILEA wearing RSPs. This dissertation investigated six specific aims through six corresponding experiments that improve our knowledge of mechanical and anthropometric properties of RSPs and the kinetic profiles of ILEA running at submaximal velocities. Four common RSP designs were tested for mechanical and anthropometric properties. ILEA with unilateral transtibial amputations who wear RSPs and an able-bodied control group participated in the running experiments. Mechanical and anthropometric results indicated that RSP marker placement had little effect on joint kinetic estimations proximal to the prostheses, and <b>trifilar</b> pendulums can measure moments of inertia with < 1 % error. The running experiments provided the first 3 D kinetic descriptions of ILEA running. The prosthetic limb typically generated lower peak kinetic parameters and 50 % lower total mechanical work than the intact and control limbs, indicating a greater reliance on the intact limb. To counter the prosthetic limb deficiencies, ILEA increased stride frequencies compared to control subjects. Additionally, the prosthetic limb demonstrated prolonged periods of anterior ground reaction force to increase propulsive impulse and prolonged hip stance phase extension moments that generated increased hip concentric work. The data indicated that ILEA wearing RSPs run differently than able-bodied runners and use several adaptive mechanisms to run at the same velocity and to increase running velocity. These mechanisms are discussed and future directions of research are suggested...|$|E
