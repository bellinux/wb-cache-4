Current mainstream approaches to establishing trust presume that communicating entities are already familiar with one another. There are essentially two approaches based on this assumption.

40|$|In Uneven Encounters, the {{forthcoming}} book from which <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> <b>excerpted,</b> Micol Seigel chronicles {{the exchange of}} popular culture between Brazil and the United States in the years between the World Wars, and she demonstrates how that exchange affected ideas of race and nation in both countries. From Americans interpreting advertisements for Brazilian coffee or dancing the Brazilian maxixe, to Rio musicians embracing the “foreign” qualities of jazz, Seigel traces a lively, cultural back-and-forth. Along the way, she shows how race and nation are constructed together, by both non-elites and elites, and gleaned from global cultural and intellectual currents as well as local, regional, and national ones. Seigel explores the circulation of images of Brazilian coffee and of maxixe in the United States during the period just after the imperial expansions of the early twentieth century. Exoticist interpretations structured North Americans’ paradoxical sense of self as productive “consumer citizens. ” Some people, however, could not simply assume the privileges of citizenship. In their struggles against racism, Afro-descended citizens living in the cities of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, New York, and Chicago encountered images and notions of each other, and found them useful. Seigel introduces readers to cosmopolitan Afro-Brazilians and African Americans who rarely traveled far but who absorbed ideas from abroad nonetheless. African American vaudeville artists saw the utility of pretending to “be” Brazilian to cross the color line on stage. Putting on “nation drag,” they passed not from one race to another but out of familiar racial categories entirely. Afro-Brazilian journalists reported intensively on foreign, particularly North American, news and eventually entered into conversation with the U. S. black press in a collaborative but still conflictual dialogue. Seigel suggests that projects comparing U. S. and Brazilian racial identities as two distinct constructions are misconceived. Racial formations transcend national borders; attempts to understand them must do the same. </p...|$|E

Nowadays, we live in an age when, if rebel armies do come sweeping into a city, or mass uprisings overthrow a dictator, it’s unlikely to have any such implications; when profound social transformation does occur—as with, say, the rise of feminism—it’s likely to take an entirely different form. It’s not that revolutionary dreams aren’t out there. But contemporary revolutionaries rarely think they can bring them into being by some modern-day equivalent of storming the Bastille.

40|$|Two {{different}} approaches are proposed to obtain explicit solutions for stochastic relaxation oscillator {{problems in the}} weak noise limit. The first method generalizes {{the idea of the}} cumulant expansion. It does not presuppose an analytical treatment of the deterministic motion. It is however restricted to the discussion of stationary situations. In the second method an adiabatic elimination of irrelevant variables allows for the computation of time dependent solutions. It can be carried through only if the deterministic limit cycle is known analytically.

40|$|Abstract A global {{scientific}} and societal endeavor {{was set in}} motion by the nanotechnology vision formulated in 1999 that inspired the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) and other national and international R&D programs. Establishing foundational knowledge at the nanoscale has been the main focus of the nanotechnology research community in the first decade. As of 2009, this new knowledge underpinned {{about a quarter of a}} trillion dollars worldwide market, of which about $ 91 billion was in US products that incorporate nanoscale components. Nanotechnology is already evolving toward becoming a general-purpose technology by 2020, encompassing four generations of products with increasing structural and dynamic complexity: (1) passive nanostructures, (2) active nanostructures, (3) nanosystems, and (4) molecular nanosystems. By 2020, the increasing integration of nanoscale science and engineering knowledge and of nanosystems promises mass applications of nanotechnology in industry, <b>This</b> <b>article</b> has <b>been</b> <b>excerpted</b> from ‘‘Nanotechnolog...|$|R
