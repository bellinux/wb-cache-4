5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} protected along {{more than}} 99% of its course by {{federal or state}} ownership of the land or by right-of-way. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> maintained {{by a variety of}} citizen organizations, environmental advocacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals. Annually, more than 4,000 volunteers contribute over 175,000 hours of effort on the Appalachian Trail, an effort coordinated largely by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) organization. In total, the AT passes through eight national forests and two national parks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its journey, the trail follows the ridge line of the Appalachian Mountains, {{crossing}} many of its highest peaks, and running, {{with only a few}} exceptions, almost continuously through wilderness. The trail used to traverse many hundreds of miles of private property; currently 99% of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> on public land.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are {{extremely}} difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles. This part of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> frequently bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat Trail to the summit of DPeak.|$|E
50|$|Original {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>were</b> constructed in <b>the</b> 1930s by the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> later upgraded and completed by <b>the</b> Potomac Appalachian <b>Trail</b> Club between 1979 and 1982. In 2011, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> designated a National Recreation Trail.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> West Coast <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 75 km (47 mi) <b>trail</b> along <b>the</b> west-coast of Vancouver Island from Port Renfrew to Bamfield. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> {{built to}} aid in the rescue of shipwrecked sailors. Construction on <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> started in 1907 and by 1910 the [...] "Lifesaving Trail" [...] <b>was</b> complete. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} in <b>the</b> 1950s. By 1970, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> transformed into <b>The</b> West Coast <b>Trail,</b> a challenging trail that takes visitors along rocky beaches, through rainforest, and across sometimes rough and muddy terrain. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> has <b>been</b> improved greatly over the years and can be traversed in 5-7 days.|$|R
40|$|Title: The {{proposal}} of <b>the</b> Geological <b>Trails</b> in <b>the</b> Area of the Rychleby Mts. Abstract: This thesis {{is devoted to}} draft for new nature <b>trails</b> in <b>the</b> area of the Rychleby Mts. with a specific focus on geology. <b>The</b> proposed <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> preceded by detailed characteristics of geomorphology, geology and stratigraphy of the studied area. <b>The</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> located in two areas, i. e. {{the northern part of}} the Rychleby Mts. (Račí údolí - Zálesí - Javorník) and Žulová highlands (Around Žulová pluton). <b>The</b> first mentioned <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> designed in two levels of difficulty for elementary and secondary schools. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>are</b> supplemented by specific guidebooks, worksheets and the "Didactic recommendation for teachers", which included general didactic recommendations, next detailed information about <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> and suggestions for other additional activities. <b>The</b> <b>trails</b> had <b>been</b> verified in practice on students, amateurs and experts. Anthe effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>was</b> evaluated through surveys with participants. It has <b>been</b> proved that <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> suitable complement of education process mainly for natural science and <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> also useful for non-educational leisure activities for visitors of these areas. Key words: nature <b>trail,</b> <b>the</b> Rychleby Mts., excursion, pedagogical use...|$|R
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow. This image, copied from the symbol used for waymarking the Ulster Way, has become the traditional waymarking symbol {{for all of the}} National Waymarked Trails in Ireland. Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|The {{first person}} to climb the {{mountain}} was Thomas Gerdine, along {{with a group of}} United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897. The volcano is also available to skiers. To reach the mountain itself, it takes 5 miles of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) and up the Sitkum Glacier. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> reached via Forest Service Road No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|Several shale {{outcrops}} {{are visible}} along the trail, {{with views of}} the Shawangunk Ridge to the west; the skytop tower of the Mohonk Mountain House is visible {{on one of the}} cliffs. Parking for <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner. In New Paltz, there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park, off Springtown Road, at the Huguenot Historical Society, and at a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) conference center. The trail runs parallel to state routes 208 and 32; there are two park and rides on Route 32, a 63-spot lot in New Paltz, and a 58-spot lot in Rosendale. There are two bicycle shops along the trail in both Gardiner and New Paltz.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Sentier NB <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> {{a network}} of hiking trails in New Brunswick, Canada built on {{abandoned}} railways. <b>The</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> mostly closed to motorized vehicles. The network is operated by <b>the</b> New Brunswick <b>Trails</b> Council, a non-profit organization. Some portions of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>are</b> also part of <b>the</b> Trans Canada <b>Trail.</b>|$|R
50|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> open year-round, but {{the most}} active months are May to October. <b>The</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> popular sites for local day hikes in the summer months and Nordic skiing in the winter months. In <b>the</b> winter, <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> groomed and {{maintained}} to allow for locals and visitors to Nordic ski along {{the face of the}} mountain. Along many of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> remnants of historic farms from early Vermont farm owners, and sites that are kept and maintained by the National Park Service.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Dennis R. Gagnon in 1974 as a lower elevation {{alternative to the}} popular John Muir Trail which it runs largely parallel to. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> named for <b>the</b> explorer Theodore Solomons.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea of the}} Appalachian Trail {{came about}} in 1921. The trail itself was {{completed}} in 1937 {{after more than a}} decade of work, although improvements and changes continue. It is maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships, and managed by the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> in forest or wild lands, although some portions traverse towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.|$|E
25|$|The name of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{linked to}} the Bruce Peninsula and Bruce County, which the trail runs through. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> named after the county, which was named after James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin who was Governor General of the Province of Canada from 1847 to 1854.|$|E

50|$|The {{road was}} {{probably}} {{started as a}} Paleo-Indian trail thousands of years ago, around 10,000 BC. Later, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> used by <b>the</b> Lenape. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> used to migrate, and travel to hunting and fishing areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Barbary Coast <b>Trail</b> <b>was</b> {{founded by}} {{historian}} Daniel Bacon {{in collaboration with}} the San Francisco Historical Society. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated in May 1998 and originally marked with painted images.
