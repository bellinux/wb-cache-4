5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{then moved}} to the offensive, in early May 1951 {{they were used to}} scout for Chinese {{concentrations}} and then call in artillery to destroy them. These actions have been viewed by historians as one of few instances where Rangers in Korea were effectively employed, used as a stealthy infiltration force for terrain <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> for conventional units.|$|E
5|$|Babb had tax {{troubles}} {{in the years}} after his success with Mom and Dad. He suggested to the Press-Enterprise that his operation was so diffuse that sales of his one-dollar sex education pamphlets were <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to track accurately. Babb eventually sold the rights to Mom and Dad and his stake in Modern Film Distributors to Erwin Joseph and Floyd Lewis—former partners in Modern Film who would continue to showcase Mom and Dad across the United States.|$|E

5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes because they were <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries were finding it <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Mega Man 2 {{released}} two years earlier, Mega Man 3 has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be <b>too</b> <b>difficult.</b> Like other titles in the series, Mega Man 3 has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, {{and as part of}} various Mega Man franchise compilations.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{personal}} advertisements section in newspapers would sometimes {{be used to}} exchange messages encrypted using simple cipher schemes. Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times. Even as late as 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army employed it {{as a replacement for}} more complicated ciphers which had proved to be <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> for their troops to master; German and Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring {{him to continue}} writing. Considering the play <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, {{was inspired by a}} friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.|$|E
5|$|Smartsheet {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to use. At {{the end of its}} first year, it had only 10,000 users. The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly. Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese had {{excellent}} {{coordination between}} light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics of quick airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force (Força Aérea Portuguesa or FAP) to surround {{and eliminate the}} guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied {{by the use of}} heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
30|$|There {{may be some}} {{situations}} where obtaining data on the quantities and prices of inputs and outputs, and for fire, could be <b>too</b> costly or <b>difficult</b> to collect. For the owners of medium and large plantations or forests, most of the raw data are already collected in annual valuations of the estate and financial management. Collecting these data might be <b>too</b> costly or <b>difficult</b> for the owners of small plantations or forests, but this could be overcome with assistance through collectives or from public research bodies.|$|R

This <b>too</b> included <b>difficult</b> engineering: Goodrington Marsh {{had to be}} crossed, {{and there were two}} masonry viaducts. The Brixham Road station was about two miles from Brixham, and important fishing port.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert gave it {{two and a}} half stars, {{calling it}} [...] "needlessly confusing," [...] saying it [...] "clearly comes from Egoyans heart" [...] but is [...] "too much, too heavily layered, <b>too</b> needlessly <b>difficult,</b> <b>too</b> opaque." [...] He also said it was disputed whether the films quote from Adolf Hitler that the Armenian Genocide is {{forgotten}} is genuine. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film a [...] "profound reflection on historical memory," [...] and [...] "hands down the years most thought-provoking film." [...] The BBCs Tom Dawson wrote the film [...] "feels clumsy and convoluted" [...] compared to Egoyans other work. Ararat has a 55% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 76 reviews, and a metascore of 62 ("Generally favorable reviews") at Metacritic.|$|R
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
5|$|Viewers {{of early}} footage {{encouraged}} DiDuro to separate it further from Sonic, so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-jump ability {{was based on}} a similar game mechanic from Ristar. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to control.|$|E

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{he began a}} {{business}} partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, with films such as Gang of Four and La Belle Noiseuse receiving international praise. He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup <b>too</b> <b>difficult</b> for him to continue. Many of his films {{are known for their}} long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1. Almost always at the insistence of the distributors, Rivette edited shorter versions of five of his films and considered some of them to be entirely new films with different meanings.|$|E
