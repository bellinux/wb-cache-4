5|$|As a simple, visible surface polyhedron, {{the outward}} {{form of the}} final stellation is {{composed}} of 180 <b>triangular</b> faces, which are the outermost <b>triangular</b> regions in the stellation diagram. These join along 270 edges, which in turn meet at 92 vertices, with an Euler characteristic of 2.|$|E
5|$|If all entries of A {{below the}} main {{diagonal}} are zero, A {{is called a}}n upper <b>triangular</b> matrix. Similarly if all entries of A above the main diagonal are zero, A is called a lower <b>triangular</b> matrix. If all entries outside the main diagonal are zero, A is called a diagonal matrix.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the <b>Triangular</b> Trade and how it connected the world. The <b>Triangular</b> Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|A <b>triangular</b> banner {{appearing}} to depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles <b>triangular</b> standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small <b>triangular</b> piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a <b>triangular</b> void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|As {{a simple}} {{polyhedron}} with 180 <b>triangular</b> faces (60 isosceles, 120 scalene), 270 edges, and 92 vertices. This interpretation {{is useful for}} polyhedron model building.|$|E
5|$|Between Lejontornet and the {{southern}} city gate flanked by two boats is a wooden structure, roughly <b>triangular</b> in plan; this is a defensive tower called Kivenäbben, built in 1520–1523 on piles in the water.|$|E
5|$|Blazed – Colored head (Capped) or body (Irish, Berkshire or self), with a <b>triangular</b> {{wedge of}} white fur over the face.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme {{railway station}} {{is an open}} <b>triangular</b> station in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, England. It is on the West Coast Main Line and is {{operated}} by Northern.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{warmed up}} by putting his ODI struggles on English soil in 1999 behind him, scoring 248 runs at 49.60 in the <b>triangular</b> tournament {{preceding}} the Tests, scoring an unbeaten 76 {{in the final}} win over Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{warmed up}} for the World Cup in South Africa by scoring 310 runs at 44.28 in the <b>triangular</b> tournament in Australia against England and Sri Lanka. His {{performances}} {{over the past year}} were recognised with the Allan Border Medal.|$|E
5|$|Kanaks {{living on}} the islands made canoes out of hollowed–out trunks and large double–hulled {{outriggers}} with <b>triangular</b> sails, known as pirogues, traditionally used for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the neckerchief {{was made}} entirely of <b>triangular</b> {{pieces of the}} tartan, but its expense forced the {{adoption}} of the current design. The neckerchief is often worn with the Gilwell woggle.|$|E
5|$|Pimlico is a <b>triangular</b> {{area between}} the River Thames and Belgravia, bounded by Vauxhall Bridge Road {{to the east and}} the railway line into Victoria Station in the west.|$|E
5|$|Pytheas of Massilia visited Britain – {{probably}} {{sometime between}} 322 and 285BCE – and {{described it as}} <b>triangular</b> in shape, with a northern tip called Orcas.|$|E
5|$|Rather heavily built, the bignose shark has a long, broad, and blunt snout {{with the}} {{nostrils}} preceded by well-developed, <b>triangular</b> flaps of skin. The moderately large, circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broadly curved and lacks obvious furrows at the corners. The upper teeth number 14–16 rows on either side and have tall, broad, <b>triangular</b> cusps with serrated edges; they are erect at the jaw center and become increasingly oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth number 14–15 rows on either side and have narrow, erect cusps with extremely fine serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long.|$|E
5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper <b>triangular</b> matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of <b>triangular</b> matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A {{as a product}} UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{commissioning}} pennant (flâmula) {{is a long}} <b>triangular</b> flag, {{green on}} the hoist and red on the fly. It is to be flown on the main mast of the naval ships commanded by officers.|$|E
5|$|The grey hypocolius {{is a small}} Middle Eastern {{bird with}} the shape and soft plumage of a waxwing. They are mainly a uniform grey colour except the males have a black <b>triangular</b> mask around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|Touring New Zealand in February 1998, Gilchrist {{topped the}} Australia averages with 200 runs at 50.00, {{including}} a match-winning 118 {{in the first}} match. He also effected his first ODI stumping, the wicket of Nathan Astle in the Second ODI in Wellington. Australia then played two <b>triangular</b> tournaments in Asia. Gilchrist struggled in India, scoring 86 runs at 17.20. He went on {{to play in the}} Coca-Cola Cup in Sharjah in April 1998, a <b>triangular</b> tournament between Australia, India and New Zealand. Australia finished runners-up in the tournament, with Gilchrist taking nine dismissals as wicketkeeper and averaging 37.13 with the bat.|$|E
5|$|West Indies went in {{with the}} same 14-man squad as in the 2006–07 DLF Cup <b>triangular</b> tournament in Malaysia in September.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{municipalities}} and counties in Ohio have adopted pennants and swallowtails {{based on the}} state burgee. The city of Mentor and Adams County have flags that essentially replace the annulus with a seal and modify the pattern of stars in the <b>triangular</b> union.|$|E
5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences {{resemble}} those of no other banksia; its closest relatives were felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having yellow flowers and leaves with deep <b>triangular</b> lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed its closest relatives to be {{the members of the}} series Crocinae.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat <b>triangular</b> when viewed from above. This <b>triangular</b> appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each <b>triangular</b> face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the <b>triangular</b> faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
5|$|M3 is a small, <b>triangular</b> tooth. There {{is large}} basin in the middle, and a mesoloph is present. At {{the back of}} the tooth, there is a {{distinct}} posteroloph. In A.donovani, there are two roots at the front (labial and lingual) and one at the back. There are no M3 of A.praeuniversitatis with preserved roots.|$|E
5|$|Macartney then toured England for the 1912 <b>Triangular</b> Test Tournament, {{which also}} {{included}} South Africa. He {{was not in}} the original touring party, but six senior players including Hill and vice-captain Warwick Armstrong and leading batsman Victor Trumper withdrew from the tour due to a dispute with the board. Macartney was thus given a late call-up.|$|E
5|$|Mantises have large, <b>triangular</b> {{heads with}} a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous {{compound}} eyes, three small simple eyes, {{and a pair}} of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.|$|E
5|$|Most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and caudal) have white tips (juvenile {{specimens}} {{and some}} adults may lack these). Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like marking may be apparent between {{first and second}} dorsal fins. The shark has several kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) have a thin, serrated tip and are relatively small and <b>triangular</b> (somewhat fang-like). Between 13 and 15 teeth are {{on either side of}} the symphysis. The teeth in the upper jaw are <b>triangular,</b> but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edges 14 or 15 occur along each side of the symphysis. The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges.|$|E
5|$|Taoist temples may fly square or <b>triangular</b> flags. They {{typically}} feature mystical {{writing or}} diagrams and {{are intended to}} fulfill various functions including providing guidance for {{the spirits of the}} dead, bringing good fortune, increasing life span, etc. Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Light Aircraft Trials {{included}} a speed section over a <b>triangular</b> course of Lympne-Postling-Brabourne-Lympne. The Folkestone Aero Trophy {{was held at}} Lympne in 1932 and the Wakefield Cup races in 1933. The final air race before the Second World War was the Folkestone Aero Trophy on 5 August 1939. This was won by Andrew Dalrymple in Chilton D.W.1 (G-AFSV).|$|E
5|$|The Ohio Burgee is the {{official}} flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. Ohio's swallowtail flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's <b>triangular</b> canton is suggestive of the state's name.|$|E
5|$|The food most {{associated}} with Purim is called ozne haman ("Haman's ears"). These are three-cornered pastries filled most often with poppy seed, but also other fruit fillings. The <b>triangular</b> shape {{may have been}} influenced by old illustrations of Haman, in which he wore a three-cornered hat.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} is designed on a <b>triangular</b> plan. The large tower {{at the tip}} of the triangle is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings extend on either side. An isolated tower that now has the library on two floors divides the curtain wall on the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is a robust and {{streamlined}} species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short. There are 12–14 tooth rows {{on each side}} of both jaws, with one or two small teeth at the symphysis (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique <b>triangular</b> cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first dorsal fin is large and <b>triangular,</b> originating above or slightly forward of the free pectoral fin tips. There is a ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer than in most requiem sharks and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.|$|E
5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is ribbed and riveted {{in the shape of}} sunbeams, with many <b>triangular</b> windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
