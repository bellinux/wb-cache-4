50|$|Prior to 1987, <b>the</b> taxi <b>industry</b> <b>was</b> highly {{regulated}} and controlled, {{with black}} taxi operators being refused permits. Sixteen-seater minibuses were illegal {{to operate as}} taxis. After 1987, <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>was</b> rapidly deregulated, leading to an influx of new minibus taxi operators, keen to make money from the high demand for this service.

5|$|On March 2009 the Colombian {{government}} {{enacted a}} mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide infrastructure to guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, car dealers, gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> not ready to supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|The {{job market}} is {{knowledge}} and service based {{and the largest}} employment sectors are healthcare and social services, trade, education, consulting, research, industry and telecommunications. The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average. Today {{the majority of the}} largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} New Zealand textile {{manufacturing}} industry and its components. It investigates the nature of location patterns, the changes within the components of <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> and <b>the</b> changes in industrial organisation which have occurred since 1950. The location of factories engaged in manufacturing textiles is detailed, shifts in components of <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> analysed and early location factors in <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> discussed. It is argued that technological advances in various facets of <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> have <b>been</b> influential in determining the present day location of the factories in <b>the</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> impact of technology and its requirements within <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> examined specifically in terms of process product and organisational adjustments. The resulting developments, particularly the form of intra- and inter- <b>industry</b> linkages <b>are</b> outlined. In addition <b>the</b> form of <b>industry</b> intra-urban linkages <b>are</b> explored with particular reference to the Wellington Region...|$|R

5|$|Tourism {{dominates the}} Croatian service sector and {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2014 was estimated at €7.4billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. <b>The</b> <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance. Since {{the conclusion of the}} Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11million tourists each year. The most numerous are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself. Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{direct impact on}} the UK economy, air {{transport}} is an £11.4billion industry, a figure which represents 1.1 per cent of the country’s economy. It employs 186,000 people (full-time equivalents), and indirectly supports an additional 334,000 jobs, although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed. In terms of productivity the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive, after the oil/gas extraction and utilities sectors, exceeding the national average {{by a factor of}} two and a half. <b>The</b> <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> also very capital intensive, accounting for up to 3.5 per cent of total UK business investment in the period 2000 to 2004. Air transport was directly responsible for £3.6billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004/5, which includes £0.9billion raised in Air Passenger Duty (APD), a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007. Because of the global nature of the industry, article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation, and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Environmental groups argue that these, along with duty-free sales, are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £9billion annually. Despite generating £6.9billion in exports in 2004, representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services, the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £3.3billion balance of payments deficit attributable to the industry.|$|E
