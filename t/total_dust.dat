40|$|Introduction: Exposure to {{crystalline}} silica {{in the construction}} workers such as miners and diggers are widespread. Exposure to respirable silica (quartz) can results in silicosis. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the contribution of each workers and component task to <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and respirable quartz exposure in the tunnel of metro.. Method and Materials: The assessment of {{crystalline silica}} and <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> was performed according to standard procedure (NIOSH 7601).. Results: Both <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and quartz levels were high. The results of <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> in the digging process (37. 63 ± 0. 76 mg/m 3) were higher than in the cement work (9. 88 ± 0. 80 mg/m 3).

40|$|Abstract—Carbon {{black is}} a very pure form of very finely divided paniculate carbon used mainly in the {{automotive}} tyre industry. Its carbonaceous nature and submicron size (unpelleted) have raised concerns with regard to its ability to affect respiratory morbidity. This paper describes the exposure to carbon black dust {{in the first and}} second phase of a large multi-national epidemiological study investigating the magnitude of these exposure-related effects. In Phase I, 1278 respirable dust samples were taken (SIMPEDS cyclone) which increased to 2941 in Phase II with a similar {{rise in the number of}} <b>total</b> inhalable <b>dust</b> samples (IOM head) from 1288 in Phase I to 3433 Phase II.

40|$|Aims The {{main purpose}} of the study was to assess and {{characterize}} the exposure to dust and selected dust constituents in the Norwegian silicon carbide industry from 1913 to 2005 and construct a retrospective job-exposure matrix for use in epidemiological studies. The dust constituents were selected based on their known or suspected lung carcinogenicity and presence in the SiC industry. Materials and methods An exposure assessment based on repeated random personal sampling within a priori defined job groups was performed in the three Norwegian silicon carbide plants in 2001 - 2003. <b>Total</b> <b>dust</b> was sampled in parallel with respirable dust or fiber. <b>Total</b> <b>dust</b> and respirable dust was analysed gravimetrically and fibers were counted by phase contrast microscopy. The respirable dust was analysed for the content of quartz, cristobalite and silicon carbide by X-ray diffractometry. To characterize the morphology and chemical composition of the fibers, additional samples were analysed using a scanning electron microscope. Information on tasks performed and other possible determinants of exposure was collected and linear mixed effect models were used to identify predictors of reduced or increased exposure. Exposure measurements and information on process and technological changes for the retrospective exposure estimation were obtained from available sources. As the majority of exposure measurements were of <b>total</b> <b>dust,</b> these were used as the basis for the retrospective exposure assessment. Linear regression models were developed to estimate <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> exposure for the time periods with exposure measurements (1967 - 2005). The exposure estimates were extrapolated backwards to periods without <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> measurements by applying multiplicators for relative changes in exposure due to process related changes and changes in working hours. The parallel sampling from the current study enabled us to construct linear mixed effect models to estimate the content of respirable dust, fiber, quartz, cristobalite and silicon carbide in <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> for the job groups and plants. These models were then applied to the <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> JEM. The performance of the models was evaluated with available historical exposure measurements of crystalline silica and fibers. PAH exposure was assessed semi-quantitatively and asbestos qualitatively. Results The fiber characterization in the furnace department showed that the silicon carbide fibers could be divided into eight groups based on morphology, in addition to cleavage fragments of silicon carbide. More than 90 % of the fibers in the furnace department were silicon carbide fibers, with less than two percent of cleavage fragments. In the processing department 82 % were silicon carbide fibers, of which cleavage fragments constituted 57 %. Exposure to sulphur dioxide, fiber, quartz and cristobalite was mainly restricted to job groups in the furnace department. Exposure to silicon carbide and <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> was significantly higher in the processing department than in the furnace and maintenance departments. The cleaner operator, charger and charger/mix operators were generally the highest exposed job groups in the furnace department, and the refinery crusher operator was the highest exposed job group in the processing department. More than 3300 historical <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> exposure measurements were available from 1967 - 2005 and the current study added another 702 <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> measurements. The linear regression models of <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> described historical exposure best in the furnace department (R 2 adj = 0. 49 - 0. 74). Models in the other departments explained less variance (R 2 adj = 0. 12 - 0. 32). Exposure determinants and <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> exposure explained a substantial portion of the between- (70 - 100 %) and within-worker (8. 0 - 54 %) variance in the mixedeffect models. The relative bias between the available historical dust measurements and the estimated exposure to dust components varied between - 39 % (fiber) and 40 % (quartz). However corrections were not considered necessary due to limitations in the historical data. The rPearson correlation coefficient for the exposure estimates were below 0. 7 for all pairs with the exception of <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and respirable dust (rPearson = 0. 84) and <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and cristobalite (rPearson = 0. 72). Job group was a strong determinant of exposure for all agents, explaining between 43 - 74 % of the between-worker variance. Determinants associated with increased exposure in the furnace department were performing the sorting of the crude silicon carbide inside the furnace hall, and the tasks cleaning, assisting in assembling and filling of furnaces and manual sorting. Filling and changing pallet boxes were important tasks related to increased exposure to <b>total</b> <b>dust,</b> respirable dust and silicon carbide in the processing department. Work in control rooms, laboratories, fresh air ventilated crane cabins, offices and maintenance outside the furnace hall and processing department were predictors of decreased dusts exposure. For maintenance workers, increased exposure to fiber was associated with maintenance in the furnace department and increased exposure to SiC was related to maintenance in the processing department. Conclusion Workers in the silicon carbide industry are exposed to a mixture of several agents, including silicon carbide fibers, quartz, cristobalite, non-fibrous SiC and sulphur dioxide. The current exposure levels are generally below the current Norwegian OELs, however, high exposure to fibers and respirable dust still occur in the furnace department. The increased number of <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> measurements and the comparative exposure study using parallel sampling of <b>total</b> <b>dust,</b> fibers and respirable dust with consecutive statistical modeling, made it possible to develop a new and improved JEM. Uncertainties remain in the exposure estimates, especially earlier than 1967 and for certain job groups without exposure measurements. The component specific metrices were sufficient different from each other to be used in component specific epidemiolocial analysis with the exception of <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and respirable dust and <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and cristobalite. Job group was a strong determinant of exposure for all agents. Several tasks were associated with increased exposure, indicating possibilities for exposure control measures. Recommendations for exposure reduction based on this study are to (1) separate the sorting area from the furnace hall, (2) minimize manual work on furnaces and in the sorting process, (3) use remote controlled sanders/grinders with ventilated cabins, (4) use closed systems for filling pallet boxes, and (5) improve cleaning procedures by using methods that minimize dust generation...|$|E

The degree to which ?-tryptase expression {{may be associated with}} asthma has not been studied. We have investigated the ?-tryptase gene copy number variation and its potential associations with phenotypes of asthma. Objectives Caucasian families (n= 341) with at least two asthmatic siblings (n= 1350) were genotyped for the ?-tryptase alleles, using high resolution melting assays. Standards for the possible ?-/?-tryptase ratios were constructed by cloning ?-and ?-tryptase PCR products to generate artificial templates. Association analysis of asthma affection status and related phenotypes (total and allergen-specific serum IgE, bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, FEV 1, and atopy and asthma severity scores) were undertaken using family based association tests (FBAT).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and its relation with exposure to respirable dust. Materials and Methods: In this study, all of 35 workers who worked in the flour producing section of three factories were chosen as case group and 20 unexposed people were selected as the control group. Exposure to <b>total</b> and respirable <b>dust</b> were measured with standard methods. Spirometry was used for determining lung function disorders and the America Lung Society Questionnaire was used for assessment of prevalence of respiratory symptoms. The results were analyzed by t-test, correlation and linear regression. Results: The average <b>total</b> and respirable <b>dust</b> exposure in the exposed group was 8. 06 and 5. 09 mg/m 3 and was higher than the threshold limit value recommended by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists(ACGIH). 52 % of workers had sputum in the morning and during waking up, 44 % felt tightness of breath or pressure in the chest, 55 % felt short of breath while walking fast and work; and in 52 % cough during work was experienced.

The mean concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide were between 2. 8 - 15 ppm and 2200 - 3200 ppm, respectively. The geometric mean of endotoxins was 19 ng/m 3 and the concentrations of fungi were at the 10 1 - 10 3 cfu/m 3 level. In general, the variation in concentrations of <b>total</b> <b>dust,</b> viable fungi and endotoxin was large. The concentrations of <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> and fungi were lower than in earlier studies. Thus new cubicle houses provide a better working environment with regard to airborne hazards than the traditional cow houses. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives - To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of byssinosis and other respiratory abnormalities in workers exposed to cotton dust in Guangzhou in two factories that processed purely cotton. Methods - All the 1320 workers exposed were included. The controls were 1306 workers with no history of occupational dust exposure. <b>Total</b> <b>dust</b> and inhalable dust were measured by Chinese <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> sampler and American vertical elutriator respectively. A World Health Organisation questionnaire was used. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) were measured by a Vitalograph spirometer. Results - The median inhalable dust concentrations ranged from 0. 41 to 1. 51 mg/m 3 and median <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations from 3. 04 to 12. 32 mg/m. The prevalence of respiratory abnormalities in the cotton workers were (a) typical Monday symptoms 9. 0 %; (b) FEV 1 fall by ≥ 5 % after a shift 16. 8 %; (c) FEV 1 fall by ≥ 10 % after a shift 4. 2 %; (d) FEV'q < 80 % predicted 6. 1 %; (e) FEV 1 /FVC < 75 % 4. 0 %; (f) cough or phlegm 18. 2 %; (g) chronic bronchitis 10 - 9 %; and (h) byssinosis, defined by (a) plus (b) 1. 7 %. With the exception of (d), most of the prevalences increased with increasing age, duration of exposure, and cumulative inhalable dust exposure. No increasing trends of respiratory abnormalities were found for current <b>total</b> <b>dust,</b> inhalable dust, and cumulative <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations. Compared with controls, after adjustment for sex and smoking, {{with the exception of}} (d), all the pooled relative risks of respiratory abnormalities were raised for cotton exposure. Conclusions - It is concluded that cumulative inhalable cotton {{is likely to be the}} cause of byssinotic symptoms, acute lung function decrements, cough, or phlegm, and chronic bronchitis. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Background It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that dust exposure causes airway inflammation among cement factory workers. However, there is limited information on the mechanisms of this effect. We explored any associations between <b>total</b> <b>dust</b> exposure and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) as a marker of airway eosinophilic inflammation among cement production workers in Tanzania. We also examined possible differences in FENO concentration between workers {{in different parts of the}} production line. Methodology We examined 127 cement workers and 28 controls from a mineral water factory. An electrochemistry-based NIOX MINO device was used to examine FENO concentration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Middle East deserts {{are often}} {{subjected}} to dust, which reduces horizontal visibility to 5 km, {{and sometimes even}} to < 1 km. The present study examines the annual and inter-annual occurrences of dust events based on 37 years of visibility observations from Hazerim (near Beer Sheba) correlated with PM 10 dust concentration. The visibility data was converted to PM 10 dust concentration, using concurrent data for three years. We then analyse the linkage between dust and synoptic- to global-scale weather systems. The monthly data indicate that the dust season starts in October and ends in May, with a maximum in March. More than 89 % of the <b>total</b> annual <b>dust</b> is accumulated between December and May, the ‘high dust season’. The annual totals vary {{as much as an}} order of magnitude from year to year. The synoptic system that produces the majority of the dust over the northern Negev is the Cyprus Low, contributing 2 / 3 of both the <b>total</b> yearly <b>dust</b> yield and of the number of dust observations. This suggests that a positive relationship exists between the dust in the Negev and rainfall in north Israel, both of which are generated by Cyprus Lows. Indeed, a significant (at 0. 05 level) correlation of + 0. 30 was found between the two. Correlation maps evidence that in dust-rich years the cyclonic activity over the Mediterranean is abnormally high and in poor-dust years it is low. A highly significant negative correlation (− 0. 66) was found between the dust yield and the intensity of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), which modulates the cyclonic activity over Europe and the northern Mediterranean. This may also imply tha...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{a search for}} "dust chimneys" {{in a sample of}} 10 highly-inclined spiral galaxies (i= 86 - 90 ^∘) which we had previously observed in the Hα emission line (Rand 1996). We have procured B-band CCD images for this purpose and employed unsharp-masking techniques to accentuate the structure of the dust lane. A scattering+absorption radiation transfer model enabled us to separate 5 galaxies from the sample which are sufficiently inclined (i> 87 ^∘) for us to reliably identify and quantify dust clouds residing at over 2 scale-heights above the disk. Three of these galaxies possess numerous curvi-linear chimney structures stretching up to 2 kpc from the midplane and the fraction of <b>total</b> galactic <b>dust</b> contained in such structures is of order 1...|$|R
40|$|This study reports {{findings}} on observed visibility reductions and associated concentrations of mineral dust from a detailed Australian case study. An {{understanding of the}} relationship between visibility and dust concentration is of considerable utility for wind erosion and aeolian dust research because it allows visibility data, which are available from thousands of weather observation stations worldwide, to be converted into dust concentrations. Until now, this application of visibility data for wind erosion/dust studies has been constrained by the scarcity of direct measurements of co-incident dust concentration and visibility measurements. While dust concentrations are available from high volume air samplers, these time-averaged data cannot be directly correlated with instantaneous visibility records from meteorological observations. This study presents a new method for deriving instantaneous values of <b>total</b> suspended <b>dust</b> from time averaged (filter-based) samples, through reference to high resolution PM 10 data. The development and testing of the model is presented here as well as a discussion of the derived expression in relation to other visibility-dust concentration predictive curves. The current study is significant because the visibility-dust concentration relationship produced is based on visibility observations made 10 e 100 km from the dust sources. This distance from source makes the derived relationship appropriate for a greater number of visibility recording stations than widely-used previous relationships based on observations made directly at eroding sources. Testing of the new formula performance against observed <b>total</b> suspended <b>dust</b> concentrations demonstrates that the model predicts dust concentration relatively well (r 2 = 0. 6) from visibility. When considered alongside previous studies, the new relationship fits into the continuum of visibility-dust concentration outcomes existing for increasing distance-from-source. This highlights the important influence that distance to source has on the visibility-dust concentration relationship. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R
