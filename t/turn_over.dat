5|$|The {{existing}} {{court and}} the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court as valid. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused a legislative mandate to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> his records to the New Court by January 1825. Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records they could find. Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the records. The Old Court continued to meet in a church in Frankfort; with two supreme courts, the possibility of civil war in Kentucky loomed.|$|E

5|$|Further {{purification}} is {{effected by}} a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady <b>turn</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians {{describe}} {{a number of}} Caligula's other desperate measures. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money. He levied taxes on lawsuits, weddings and prostitution. Caligula began auctioning {{the lives of the}} gladiators at shows. Wills that left items to Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula. Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> spoils to the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{first appeal}} opened in September 2007 in the Court of Appeal of Paris, before {{a three-judge panel}} led by Judge Laurence Trébucq. The court asked France2 to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the 27minutes of raw footage the {{cameraman}} said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing. France2 produced 18minutes; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot.|$|E
50|$|Thirteen tiles are {{not used}} {{in the game and}} are placed to the side. The dealer <b>turns</b> <b>over</b> one piece. The next tile in {{sequence}} is considered a dora (having any of those pieces in a hand will give a bonus-point). For example, if the tile <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> is a 3 circle, then all 4 circles will be considered dora and having a pong of 4 circles will score 3 bonus-points. If a 9 is <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> then the 1 circle is considered a dora. The sequence of dragons is green, red, white, green (i.e. if a red dragon is <b>turned</b> <b>over,</b> the white dragons are dora tiles). The sequence of winds is north, east, south, north. If a flower tile is <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> then all flower tiles score 2 bonus-points in total and having all three (as the flower <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> is considered a part of the dead wall and not used during the game) then the usual 8 bonus-points in total are given.|$|R
50|$|In March 2011, the UK online {{gambling}} industry employed 6,077 full-time employees. A {{number that}} has declined since 2008 where 8,918 full-time employees were in employment within the industry. Also, there were 291 remote gambling activity licences held by 225 operators at this date. Three of the sectors within online gambling are betting, bingo and casino which between them <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> £13,456.07 million between April 2010 and March 2011.

5|$|The {{residents}} of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez and blamed {{him for the}} destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments. Nothing came of those recriminations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|Adam Evans/Rubber-Band Man (voiced by Kadeem Hardison) – A meta-human {{whose body}} {{structure}} consists of shapeable rubber. He is {{the younger brother}} of Static's archenemy, Ebon. Rubber-Band Man first appears as a tragic villain when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who stole one of his songs. He subsequently breaks out of prison but decides not to pursue a criminal career, however. He and Sharon eventually start dating, with Sharon helping Adam <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> a new leaf. He and Virgil initially clash, but Virgil comes to accept Adam's relationship with his sister and they become allies in crime-fighting, with Adam even becoming like an older-brother figure to Virgil.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station's overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|E
5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first player}} <b>turns</b> <b>over</b> the top card of his Flinch Pile {{and if it}} is a one, it gets placed {{in the middle of the}} table.

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee.

After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E

5|$|In 987, Maymun, emir of Derbent, {{asked the}} Rus' {{to help him}} against local chiefs. The Rus', many of whom {{appear to have been}} {{professional}} soldiers, arrived on 18 ships. Uncertain of their reception, they sent only one ship to reconnoitre the situation. When its crew were massacred by the local population, the Rus' went on to loot the city of Maskat. In 989, this same Maymun is reported to have refused the demand of a local preacher to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> his Rus' mercenaries to him for either conversion to Islam or death. In the ensuing struggle, Maymun was driven from the city and forced to surrender the Rus' soldiers, but he returned in 992.|$|E
5|$|In March 1826, a French-Canadian {{man named}} Methode, his Native American wife, and their {{children}} were gathering maple syrup in present-day Iowa, about twelve miles north of Prairie du Chien, when they were murdered, apparently by a Ho-Chunk raiding party that had been passing through. The murderers evidently had no specific grievance with the victims, who were targets of opportunity. Two Ho-Chunk suspects were arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford. After they escaped, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho-Chunk hostages and demanded that the Ho-Chunk tribe <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the murderers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal to <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E
2500|$|In certain cases, {{where no}} player decides {{to reveal a}} card to {{determine}} the dominant suit, then the first card in the kitty [...] is <b>turned</b> <b>over,</b> and its suit is adopted as the dominant suit. If the card <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> is a joker, then the subsequent card is <b>turned</b> <b>over,</b> or the cards may be reshuffled to ensure fairness. In other variations, the cards in the kitty are continuously <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> until the trump rank appears, in which that suit is the trump and no more cards are flipped. If no cards of the trump rank appear, the biggest card's suit is trump, or if two cards are tied for biggest, then the one flipped first is declared the trump suit.|$|R
40|$|Beef steaks between 1 cm and 3 cm-thick were inoculated with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and/or {{temperature}} histories {{were collected}} at steak centres, at points initially below the central plane, and/or at points 1 cm or 2 cm from steak edges. The steaks were <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> once during grilling when temperatures at the centres reached 30 °C or 50 °C, or at specified times once, twice or {{several times during}} cooking to specified temperatures between 60 and 71 °C. When steaks were <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> at centre temperature of 30 or 50 °C, some points in some steaks did not reach the temperatures specified for steak centres. When steaks <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> at 50 °C were cooked to 60, 63 or 65 °C, E. coli O 157 :H 7 inoculated at ? 5 log cfu at each point survived at some points in some steaks at numbers ? 3 log cfu. When steaks were <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> once during cooking to 71 °C, E. coli O 157 :H 7 survived at some points in some steaks <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> after ? 8 min.
