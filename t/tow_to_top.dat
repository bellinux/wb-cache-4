On the main slope, two Poma button lifts give a drag <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> the <b>top</b> and can be exited either at the half way point on the slope or at the top station of the 200m slope. Rope tows are used on the beginners slope.|$|R

2500|$|The ride {{begins when}} the train is pulled {{backwards}} from the station and up a [...] lift hill. [...] It is held for several seconds before releasing riders into a [...] drop sending them [...] through the loading station. The train then enters a Cobra roll element that transitions into a vertical loop. Upon exiting the loop, the train climbs the second lift hill making it {{most of the way}} up on its own momentum. [...] Once <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>top,</b> the train is quickly released sending riders through the ride in reverse before being caught by the first lift hill and returned to the loading station.|$|R

Upon exiting the loop, the train runs up a second lift hill, which is angled so that the two lifts meet at the top in a [...] "V"-like formation. Once out of momentum, the train is <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>top</b> of the lift hill, and is held for several seconds before being released; traveling through the roller coaster in reverse {{before returning to the}} station.|$|R
5000|$|Russian {{soldiers}} occupied Paris from 1815 through 1816, {{after the}} defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, {{and they may have}} introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills. In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the Champs Elysees. Its most famous feature was the Promenades Aériennes or [...] "Aerial Strolls." [...] It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. [...] The three-wheel carts were <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>top</b> of a tower, and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side. King Louis XVIII of France came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride. Beaujon's park soon had half-a-dozen imitators, called [...] "The French Mountains," [...] the [...] "Mountains of Belleville" [...] the [...] "Miniature Mountains", the [...] "Swiss Mountains", the [...] "Russian Mountains", and even [...] "The Egyptian Mountains." [...] but none lasted for long; real estate prices were soaring, the parks were developed. However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion; in 1887 another French entrepreneur, Joseph Oller, the co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, [...] "Russian Mountains of Belleville" [...] with two hundred meters of track laid out in a double-eight. He later enlarged the ride to four eight-shaped loops.|$|R
