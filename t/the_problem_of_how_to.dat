5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> design a boat that would be small and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes to solve <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice {{embedded in the}} top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, {{taking advantage of the}} growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E

25|$|Michelson had a {{solution}} to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> construct a device sufficiently accurate to detect aether flow. In 1877, while teaching at his alma mater, the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Michelson conducted his first known light speed experiments {{as a part of}} a classroom demonstration.

25|$|He was {{the first}} Stoic to depart from the {{orthodox}} doctrine that passions were faulty judgments and posit that Plato's view of the soul had been correct, namely that passions were inherent in human nature. In addition to the rational faculties, Posidonius taught that the human soul had faculties that were spirited (anger, desires for power, possessions, etc.) and desiderative (desires for sex and food). Ethics was <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with these passions and restore reason as the dominant faculty.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the houses}} on the square still have their {{original}} coal holes and ornate cast iron covers. These small holes in the street outside each house lead to a coal house underneath the street. These elegantly solved <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> quickly and cleanly deliver coal to the house, allowing the coal men to simply pull the hole open and empty their sacks of coal down through it hole. The basement of the house then had a doorway into the coal house, under the street.|$|E

25|$|Another {{architectural}} breakthrough at Chartres was {{a resolution}} to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> arrange attached columns or shafts around a pier {{in a way that}} worked aesthetically – but which also satisfied the desire for structural logic that characterised French high gothic. The nave at Chartres features alternating round and octagonal solid cored piers, each of which has four attached half-columns at the cardinal points, two of which (on the east-west axis) support the arches of the arcade, one acts as the springing for the aisle vault and one supports the cluster of shafts that rise through the triforium and clerestory to support the high-vault ribs. This pier design, known as pilier cantonné was to prove highly influential and subsequently featured {{in a number of other}} high gothic churches.|$|E

Originally intended as an apolitical idyll, it became, as Miłosz writes, [...] "something unique in world literature, and <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> classify it has remained the crux of a constant quarrel among scholars"; it [...] "has been called 'the last epos' in world literature". [...] Pan Tadeusz was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim as [...] "the highest achievement in all Polish literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Groves sent Kirkpatrick to {{supervise}} construction on Tinian by the Seabees of the 6th Naval Construction Brigade. Four air-conditioned Quonset huts {{of a type}} normally used for bombsight repair were provided for laboratory and instrument work. [...] There were five warehouses, a shop building, and assembly, ordnance and administrative buildings. Ramsey overcame <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> ship through the San Francisco Port of Embarkation. The port wanted a detailed list of what was being sent so it could track it to ensure delivery, but {{what needed to be}} shipped was still subject to last-minute change. He simply designated everything as a [...] "bomb assembly kit". Three of these, one for Little Boy, one for Fat Man and one spare, were shipped to Tinian, which was now codenamed Destination O, commencing in May. Kirkpatrick arranged for everything to be shipped direct to Tinian rather than via Guam, as was usual.|$|E
500|$|As AGF commander, McNair {{worked to}} solve <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. [...] Rather than adopt {{the model of}} replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. [...] In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. [...] New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies {{who had been killed}} or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|When Kaga {{was being}} designed, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with exhaust gases in carrier {{operations}} {{had not been}} resolved. The swiveling funnels of [...] had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, Akagi and Kaga were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. Kagas funnel gases were collected {{in a pair of}} long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because Kaga was slower than the Akagi which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located {{on the side of the}} ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.|$|E
500|$|The pair had to {{overcome}} the challenge of how to represent [...] Thai speech and music. [...] Rodgers, who had experimented with Asian music in his short-lived 1928 musical with Lorenz Hart titled Chee-chee, {{did not wish to}} use actual Thai music, which American audiences might not find accessible. [...] Instead, he gave his music an exotic flavor, using open fifths and chords in unusual keys, in ways pleasant to Western ears. Hammerstein faced <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> represent Thai speech; he and Rodgers chose to convey it by musical sounds, made by the orchestra. [...] For the King's style of speech, Hammerstein developed an abrupt, emphatic way of talking, which was mostly free of articles, as are many East Asian languages. [...] The forceful style reflected the King's personality and was maintained even when he sang, especially in his one solo, [...] "A Puzzlement". [...] Many of the King's lines, including his first utterance, [...] "Who? Who? Who?", and much of the initial scene between him and Anna, are drawn from Landon's version. [...] Nevertheless, the King is presented more sympathetically in the musical than in the novel or the 1946 film, as the musical omits the torture and burning at the stake of Lady Tuptim and her partner.|$|E

5000|$|In Hitler's mind, {{communism}} {{was a major}} {{enemy of}} Germany, an enemy he often mentions in Mein Kampf. During the trial for {{his involvement in the}} Beer-Hall Putsch, Hitler claimed that his singular goal was to assist the German government in [...] "fighting Marxism". Marxism, Bolshevism, and Communism were interchangeable terms for Hitler as evidenced by their use in Mein Kampf: In the years 1913 and 1914 I expressed my opinion {{for the first time in}} various circles, some of which are now members of the National Socialist Movement, that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> the German nation can be secured is <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Marxism can be exterminated.|$|R

5000|$|According to A. F. Burns: Business cycles are {{not merely}} {{fluctuations}} in aggregate economic activity. The critical feature that distinguishes them from the commercial convulsions of earlier centuries or from the seasonal and other short term variations of our own age is that the fluctuations are widely diffused over the economy - its industry, its commercial dealings, and its tangles of finance. The economy {{of the western world}} is a system of closely interrelated parts. He who would understand business cycles must master the workings of an economic system organized largely in a network of free enterprises searching for profit. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> business cycles come about is therefore inseparable from <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> a capitalist economy functions.|$|R
