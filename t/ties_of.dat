5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> friendship with some of its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid. Folk medicine has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{hills of}} Euonymeia, {{together}} with the adjacent coastal promontory of Agios Kosmas {{are the two most}} important sites of Neolithic and Aegean Bronze Age development in the area of Athens prior to ca. 3000 BCE. Ceramics and obsidian tools found on both sites were identified as originating from the island of Melos, indicating close <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> these settlements with the obsidian-rich islands of the cycladic civilization. The commonality of findings in Agios Kosmas and Euonymeia suggests that the two settlements were functionally linked coastal and inland communities.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers. At {{the top of}} the social structure was the king, who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo-Saxon life and whose household had special privileges and protection. Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was bound up with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed the next level of society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a lower class still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{abandoned}} the Pentropic divisional structure in 1965, {{and in an}} attempt to restore some of the regional <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> the State-based regiments, a number of the regional companies of the State-based regiments were split and used to form new battalions with their traditional numerical designations. As a result, on 1 July 1965, 'C' Company, 2 RNSWR was used to re-raise the 2nd Battalion in its own right. This unit remained in existence until 1987, when further reforms to the Army Reserve led to a {{reduction in the number of}} infantry units across Australia and, at a ceremony held at Newcastle on 5 December 1987, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 17th to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, within the 8th Brigade. Before amalgamation, the battalion's regimental march was Braganza, which was confirmed in 1953.|$|E

5|$|The exarchs of Africa were {{effectively}} Governor-Generals {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} powers. Their seat of power was Carthage. Historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment, even suggesting it would require prominent <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> Heraclius the Elder to Africa or the wider Western Roman Empire. Later historians pointed, however, that this appointment {{was part of a}} wider pattern. In the 6th century, several prominent Byzantine military commanders had started their careers in the eastern regions of the Empire, often in the vicinity of Upper Mesopotamia. Then they were transferred to North Africa {{at some point in their}} respective careers. There is therefore no indication that this rotation from the eastern to the western provinces was unusual.|$|E
5|$|The seven castles are {{traditionally}} considered {{a symbol of}} the Portuguese victories over their Moorish enemies, under Afonso III, who supposedly captured seven enemy fortresses {{in the course of his}} conquest of the Algarve, concluded in 1249. However, this explanation is weakly founded since this king did not have seven castles on his banner, but an unspecified number. Some reconstructions display about sixteen castles; this number changed to twelve in 1385, to seven in 1485 and to eleven in 1495; it then changed back to seven, in 1578, this time definitively. An hypothesis about the origin of the castles on a red bordure lies in the family <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> Afonso III with Castile (both his mother and second wife were Castilian), whose arms consisted of a golden castle on a red field.|$|E
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E

25|$|As a {{means of}} {{loosening}} old <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> allegiance, and of rationalizing administration, the old divisions based on feudal ownership were replaced by départements of roughly uniform size and named after geographical features such as rivers.
