500|$|On June 8, 2012, Ocean {{posted on}} his tumblr a cryptic, almost two-minute video, {{promoting}} an unknown project which was titled Channel Orange. The clip featured an expensive-looking car, {{and it also}} contained new music. Later that day Ocean posted the full song used in the video, titled [...] "Pyramids" [...] onto his SoundCloud account. Popdust noted that [...] "trailers won’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>everything.</b> For example, the brief snippet of Frank Ocean’s new track “Pyramids” heard in an ambiguous trailer {{a few days ago}} left out one key detail of the track: the damn thing is 10 minutes long." [...] The cover artwork for the single features sexual Simpsons characters.|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Girls Aloud {{signed a}} new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums. However, in July 2009, the group {{announced}} that they were taking a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010; this did not happen, however. Two months later, the hiatus was briefly interrupted when they did two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium. In April 2012, during an interview with Chris Moyles on Radio 1, Cheryl Cole revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In August 2012, Nicola Roberts was also featured on the same radio show, and said, [...] "It's our tenth birthday in November so we will definitely celebrating. I wanna <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> but I really can't!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{personal}} life, she had fewer of those neurotic or intense character traits, according to Ralph Schoenstein, who dated her {{and worked with}} her on her humor books. He said, [...] "She has no airs. She doesn't stand on ceremony. The woman has absolutely no pretense. She'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>everything</b> immediately. Joan isn't cool—she's completely open. It's all grist. It's her old thing—'Can we talk?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{officers}} did {{not open}} the cupboard, but asked Nilsen {{if there were}} any other body parts to be found, to which Nilsen replied: [...] "It's a long story; it goes back a long time. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>everything.</b> I want to get it off my chest. Not here — at the police station". He was then arrested and cautioned on suspicion of murder, before being taken to Hornsey Police Station.|$|E
2500|$|Milošević {{denounced the}} {{declaration}} of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that [...] "Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition was like when the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević. The transcript involved Milošević ordering Karadzic to [...] "Go to Uzelac , he'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>everything.</b> If you have any problems, telephone me", and said [...] "As long as there is the army no one can touch us... Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [...] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so." [...] The conversation revealed that Milošević controlled the military strategy for the war in Bosnia and that Montenegro was under his control.|$|E
