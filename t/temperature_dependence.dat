5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a <b>temperature</b> <b>dependence</b> for electric current.|$|E
5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical {{model for a}} classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's model described properties of metals {{in terms of a}} gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law. However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and magnetic properties of metals, and the <b>temperature</b> <b>dependence</b> of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the non-analytic <b>temperature</b> <b>dependences</b> {{of the specific}} heat coefficient, C(T) /T, and spin susceptibility, χ_s (T), of 2 D interacting fermions beyond the weak-coupling limit. We demonstrate within the Luttinger-Ward formalism that the leading <b>temperature</b> <b>dependences</b> of C(T) /T and χ_s (T) are linear in T, and are described by the Fermi liquid theory. We show that these <b>temperature</b> <b>dependences</b> are universally determined by the states near the Fermi level and, for a generic interaction, are expressed via the spin and charge components of the exact backscattering amplitude of quasi-particles. We compare our theory to recent experiments on monolayers of 3 He. Comment: 5 pages, 1 eps figure, submitted to PR...|$|R

The PL {{intensity of the}} E 2 band is much weaker than that with the SiO 2 barrier, which was previously reported[22]. Therefore, we consider that this E 2 band originates from oxygen-related surface or interface states of the Si NDs, {{and we would like}} to discuss mainly about the E 1 emission. In the low-temperature regime below 150 K, the PL intensity is almost constant. The intensity increases toward 200 K and peaks at a maximum around 250 K. The PL intensity then decreases monotonically with further increasing temperature. Quantitative discussion about these <b>temperature</b> <b>dependences</b> of the PL intensity will be made later.|$|R

25|$|Capacitors {{deviate from}} the ideal {{capacitor}} equation {{in a number}} of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be analyzed as nearly linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of an ideal capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and ordinary (normal, e.g., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is <b>temperature</b> <b>dependence.</b> Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.|$|E
25|$|After 1922, {{experimental}} interest increased, {{particularly in}} the groups led by Millikan at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, and by Gossling at the General Electric Company in London. Attempts to understand autoelectronic emission included plotting experimental current-voltage (i - V) data in different ways, {{to look for a}} straight-line relationship. Current increased with voltage more rapidly than linearly, but plots of type (log(i) vs. V) were not straight. Schottky suggested in 1923 that the effect might be due to thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of type (log(i) vs. V1/2) should be straight; but they were not. Nor is Schottky's explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak <b>temperature</b> <b>dependence</b> in CFE – a point initially overlooked.|$|E

Paraelectric titanium dioxide (rutile) {{was used as the}} first ceramic dielectric because it had a linear <b>temperature</b> <b>dependence</b> of capacitance for temperature compensation of resonant circuits and can replace mica capacitors. 1926 these ceramic capacitors were produced in small quantities with increasing quantities in the 1940s. The style of these early ceramics was a disc with metallization on both sides contacted with tinned wires. This style predates the transistor and was used extensively in vacuum-tube equipment (e.g., radio receivers) from about 1930 through the 1950s.|$|E
