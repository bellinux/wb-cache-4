5000|$|Indecisive {{wavering}} (the-tshoms, doubt) is entertaining two {{minds about}} what is true - in other words, wavering between accepting or rejecting what is true. What is <b>true</b> refers <b>to</b> such facts as the four noble truths and behavioral cause and effect. Moreover, the wavering may tend more <b>to</b> the <b>side</b> of what is <b>true,</b> more <b>to</b> the <b>side</b> of what is false, or be evenly divided between the two. Indecisive wavering functions {{as a basis for}} not engaging with what is constructive.|$|R
60|$|And {{this was}} cause enough, if no other cause existed, for {{partiality}} to Mr. Crawley at Framley Court. But, {{as has been}} partly explained, there existed, if possible, even stronger ground than this for adherence to the Crawley cause. The younger Lady Lufton had known the Crawleys intimately, and the elder Lady Lufton had reckoned them among the neighbouring clerical families of her acquaintance. Both these ladies were therefore staunch in their defence of Mr. Crawley. The archdeacon himself had his own reasons,--reasons which for the present he kept altogether within his own bosom,--for wishing that Mr. Crawley had never entered the diocese. Whether the perpetual curate {{should or should not}} be declared to be a thief, it would be terrible to him to have to call the child of that perpetual curate his daughter-in-law. But not the less on this occasion was he <b>true</b> <b>to</b> his order, <b>true</b> <b>to</b> his <b>side</b> in the diocese, <b>true</b> <b>to</b> his hatred of the palace.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{inspired}} by watching a televised Shakti concert (featuring his old hero John McLaughlin), Dunnery later admitted he [...] "realised {{there was still}} a musician in me, and that I had <b>to</b> be as <b>true</b> <b>to</b> that <b>side</b> of my character as I was being to the other sides." [...] He decided to re-engage with the music business, although this time he decided to do it entirely on his own terms and to take as much responsibility for the outcome as he could. His first step was to refresh himself by returning to the UK {{for the first time in}} five years to play a few concerts, and his second step was to set up his own internet-based record label, Aquarian Nation, with the intention of releasing his future albums on it (as well as albums by other artists).|$|R

It is true that the rise may be to the gallows; but if one plays for high stakes, one must risk one's purse. I love excitement, and believe that I am no fool. I can at least be <b>true</b> <b>to</b> the <b>side</b> that I engage upon, and of the two, would rather take that of the king than of the Parliament, because {{it seems to me that}} there are more fools on his side than on the other, and therefore more chance for a wise head to prosper." ...|$|R
60|$|How {{the author}} finds himself embarrassed for having {{introduced}} into his history a new sect {{different from the}} three he had undertaken to treat of; and how his inviolable respect to the sacred number three obliges him to reduce these four, as he intends to do all other things, to that number; and for that end to drop the former Martin and to substitute in his place Lady Bess's institution, which is to pass {{under the name of}} Martin in the sequel of this true history. This weighty point being cleared, the author goes on and describes mighty quarrels and squabbles between Jack and Martin; how sometimes the one had the better and sometimes the other, to the great desolation of both farms, till at last both <b>sides</b> concur <b>to</b> hang up the landlord {162c}, who pretended to die a martyr for Martin, though he had been <b>true</b> <b>to</b> neither <b>side,</b> and was suspected by many to have a great affection for Peter.|$|R
50|$|The {{heroine of}} the series is a timid otaku who is afraid of {{revealing}} herself. She's attractive and popular. She usually shows herself as someone who hates Otaku culture, but will reveal her <b>true</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> those she trusts. After Yūto discovers she's actually an Otaku, he promises to keep her secret and they become friends. She regularly posts art on a message board under the pseudonym of Sayane. She dislikes being mistaken for a fujoshi. Like Yūto, she's a fan of Gadget Maid.|$|R
40|$|Side {{effects of}} {{prescribed}} medications {{are a common}} occurrence. Electronic healthcare databases present the opportunity <b>to</b> identify new <b>side</b> effects efficiently but currently the methods are limited due to confounding (i. e. when an association between two variables is identified due to them both being associated to a third variable). In this {{paper we propose a}} proof of concept method that learns common associations and uses this knowledge <b>to</b> automatically refine <b>side</b> effect signals (i. e. exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the signal instances that are most likely <b>to</b> correspond <b>to</b> <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effect occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the outcome within 60 days of the exposure. Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i. e. exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely <b>to</b> correspond <b>to</b> <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule mining parameters for specific health outcomes. This paper shows that {{it may be possible to}} filter signals at a patient level based on association rules learned from considering patients' medical histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate the tuning of the method's parameters.

60|$|The {{people of}} Nuremberg were <b>true</b> <b>to</b> the <b>side</b> they had chosen, {{and placed the}} whole of their {{resources}} at his disposal. Gustavus at once set his army to work to form a position in which he could confront the overwhelming forces of the enemy. Round the city, {{at a distance of}} about thirteen hundred yards from it, he dug a ditch, nowhere less than twelve feet wide and eight deep, but, where most exposed to an attack, eighteen feet wide and twelve deep. Within the circuit of this ditch he erected eight large forts and connected them with a long and thick earthen parapet strengthened with bastions. On the ramparts and forts three hundred cannon, for the most part supplied by the city of Nuremberg, were placed in position. As the camp between the ramparts and the town was traversed by the river Pegnitz numerous bridges were thrown across it, so that the whole force could concentrate on either side in case of attack. So vigorously did the army, assisted by the citizens, labour at these works, that they were completed in fourteen days after Gustavus reached Nuremberg.|$|R

60|$|Frank, when he {{returned}} home for his summer vacation, found that Mary had again flown; and the very fact of her absence added fuel to the fire of his love, more perhaps than even her presence might have done. For the flight of the quarry ever adds eagerness to the pursuit of the huntsman. Lady Arabella, moreover, had a bitter enemy; a foe, utterly opposed <b>to</b> her <b>side</b> in the contest, where she had once fondly looked for her staunchest ally. Frank was now in the habit of corresponding with Miss Dunstable, and received from her most energetic admonitions <b>to</b> be <b>true</b> <b>to</b> the love which he had sworn. <b>True</b> <b>to</b> it he resolved to be; and therefore, when he found that Mary was flown, he resolved to fly after her.|$|R
