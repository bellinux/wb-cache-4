Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Spark</b> ignition <b>of</b> the air-fuel mixture at the appropriate time is important for successful flame initiation and complete combustion thereafter without unnecessary emissions. The physical and chemical reactions taking place between the spark plug electrodes during spark delivery determine the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> and subsequent flame initiation. The energy <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> and the duration of its delivery are dependent on the ignition system design. The characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> plug determine the interaction <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> with the air-fuel mixture. The compression pressure, combustion chamber temperature and mixture motion at the time <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> generation {{play a significant role in}} the flame initiation process. All of these parameters are responsible for the resulting spark discharge and flame initiation process. The objectives of this research include investigation of the different phases <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> discharge and development of a thermodynamic analysis to determine the rate of change <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> kernel temperature with time during the initial phases <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> discharge. The effect <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> energy delivery rate, heat transfer losses and mass entrainment on the spark kernel temperature was determined through the thermodynamic analysis. This research also includes an evaluation of the various types of conventional as well as high-energy ignition systems for lean burn engines. An experimental ignition system was constructed to determine the effect <b>of</b> ignition energy, <b>spark</b> plug electrode geometry and gas pressure on {{the character}}istics <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> discharge. Images <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> discharge were captured through photography using three different types of electrode geometries and also by varying the pressure and by changing the ignition energy using different condensers in the ignition system. Finally, the results of the thermodynamic analysis were compared with the results from the experiment...|$|R

The first end to be secured by Spain is riddance of the enemy: the second, permanent independence: and the third, a free constitution of government; which will give their main (though far from sole) value to the other two; and without which little more than a formal independence, and perhaps scarcely that, can be secured. Humanity and honour, and justice, and all the sacred feelings connected with atonement, retribution, and satisfaction; shame that will not sleep, and the sting of unperformed duty; and all the powers of the mind, the memory that broods over the dead and turns to the living, the understanding, the imagination, and the reason;--demand and enjoin that the wanton oppressor should be driven, with confusion and dismay, from the country which he has so heinously abused.|$|R

Therefore the effects <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> timing on the CAI combustion process were investigated through the introduction <b>of</b> <b>spark.</b> The effect on engine performance and the emission specific values were evaluated. The engine speed was maintained at 1500 r/min and lambda was kept constant at 1. 2. It was found that with spark-assisted CAI, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), and indicated specific oxides of nitrogen (ISNOx) values increased as compared with CAI without spark.
