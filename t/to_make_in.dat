5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{many other}} British and Irish actors, Nesbitt {{was cast in}} Peter Jackson's three-part film The Hobbit, as the dwarf Bofur. Nesbitt had not read J.R.R. Tolkien's novel but {{accepted}} the role immediately. As the film was scheduled to take over 12 months <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand, Nesbitt's wife and daughters moved with him, and his daughters were enrolled in a New Zealand school. Filming commenced in March 2011. The first part, , was released in December 2012, the second part, , in December 2013, and {{the third and final}} part, , in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|Paterson's worms are {{an attempt}} to {{simulate}} the behaviour of prehistoric worms. These creatures fed upon sediment {{at the bottom of}} ponds and avoided retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> <b>In</b> 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids.|$|E

5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes {{were not}} easy to collect: both the {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments they had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were {{not easy to}} collect {{and had to be}} sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E

Boulton and his father make small silver items throughout the 18th century, {{and there is no}} record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton does so. To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm makes many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which are shaped and joined together.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was producing enough energy in the resonators. As the electron passed the opening in the resonator they deposited some of their energy as radio waves, but only a small amount. To generate useful amounts of radio energy, the electrons either had to pass the resonators multiple times to deposit more energy in total, or huge electron currents had to be used. Single-chamber klystrons, like those being used at the time, had to go the latter route, and were difficult <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> a form with useful output given a reasonable input power.|$|E

25|$|Because the tax did not vary, the {{treasury}} could estimate fairly well {{how much they}} were going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> revenue for the year. Prior to Khosrow's tax reforms, taxes were collected based on the yield that the land had produced. This system was changed to one which calculated and averaged taxation based on the water rights for each piece of property. Lands which grew date palms and olive trees used a slightly different method of taxation based {{on the amount of}} producing trees that the land contained. These tax reforms of Khosrow were the stepping stone which enabled subsequent reforms in the bureaucracy and the military to take place.|$|E
25|$|Reith's {{attempts}} to broadcast statements by the Labour Party and TUC leaders were {{blocked by the}} Government; in partial response, he personally vetoed a statement that Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, wished <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> <b>in</b> the belief that allowing such a statement would give Winston Churchill both motive and opportunity {{to take over the}} BBC—something which Churchill had continually advocated {{since the beginning of the}} Strike. Reith admitted to his staff that he would have preferred to allow the Labour and TUC leaders to broadcast directly. A post-strike analysis carried out by the BBC's Programme Correspondence Department reported that of those polled, 3,696 commended the BBC's coverage, whilst 176 were critical.|$|E
25|$|When Ewell's corps did attack these {{positions}} on July 2 and July 3, the Union had {{had time to}} fully occupy the heights and build impregnable defenses, resulting in heavy Confederate losses. Postwar proponents of the lost cause movement, particularly Jubal Early, but also Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, who {{had been assigned to}} Ewell's staff during the battle, criticized him bitterly in attempts to deflect any blame for the loss of the battle on Robert E. Lee. Part of their argument was that the Union troops were completely demoralized by their defeat earlier in the day, but Ewell's men were also disorganized, and decisions such as they were propounding are far simpler <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> hindsight than in the heat of battle and fog of war.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Peled—member of the Left Camp of Israel Executive {{for the whole}} of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf—claimed that the Palestinian leadership, {{representing}} its entire people, could not be expected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if and when it came to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP—with Peled and Avnery at its head—became a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the acts}} of this council is found a {{statement}} of the Bishop of Monterey concerning the California Missions. He informed the Fathers that a large sum of money had formerly been placed {{in the hands of}} the Mexican Government to be used under the sanction of Spanish law for the support of the Californian missionaries. For years they had received none of this money and the late revolutions made any hope of reparation unlikely. However, as it is reported that the civil power in California intends to demand this money from the Mexican treasury for public purposes, he desired to know what effort the American bishops thought it desirable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> the premises. The outcome of the whole discussion was the sending of a letter on the subject to the Archbishop of Mexico. The money was later recovered and employed for the Church in California.|$|E
25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could babble {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go {{through a number of}} stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will begin <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>in</b> manual communication.|$|E
