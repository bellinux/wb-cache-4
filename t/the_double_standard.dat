5|$|In March 2017, to {{coincide}} with International Women's Day and Women's History Month, the Tory Burch Foundation launched Embrace Ambition, a global campaign to address <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> that exists around ambition, which is often seen as a positive trait in men and a negative one in women. The campaign includes a video PSA featuring a variety of celebrities, both women and men. In September 2017, Burch wrote an opinion piece in TIME on pay equity for women, noting how equal pay benefits society and business across the board.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s, as {{baby boomers}} were {{entering}} high school, {{there was a}} growing backlash against enforced nude male swimming and by the 1970s, it had largely been phased out along with gender integration of pools. Male students protested <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> of being required to go nude due to wool lint from swimwear clogging pool filters when it {{did not appear to}} cause a problem with girls' swim costumes. In any case, rising living standards post-WWII created a greater desire for privacy.|$|E
25|$|Prostitution {{was both}} highly visible and {{pervasive}} in 18th-century Dublin, centred on Temple Bar and reflected the whole spectrum of socioeconomic class, from street prostitutes, through organised brothels to high class courtesans, who were often illegitimate {{daughters of the}} upper class. A well known example was Margaret Leeson. The role of the prostitute in 18th century Ireland was at least partly a product of <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> of female sexuality. Typical of {{this was the way}} that venereal disease was constructed as being spread by prostitutes rather than their largely male clients. Irish prostitutes were frequently the victims of violence against women. Early 'rescue' campaigns emerged in this time with Lady Arabella Denny and the Magdalene Asylums. These provided shelter but in return expected menial labour and penitence.|$|E

The GULag, or Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, was an effective instrument of political repression.

The Nine for IX documentary, Branded, in which Solo appeared focused on the marketing of female professional athletes and <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> that they often face with more value placed on beauty rather than their athletic excellence.

500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along {{we have been told}} by Fox that none of our {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. But now we have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults."

500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Muhammad {{has long}} been {{featured}} {{as one of the}} many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy. When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, [...] "We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they might hurt us. Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't hurt us, but we won't rip on [...] because they might hurt us.'" [...] The Muhammad subplot in [...] "200", like the [...] "Cartoon Wars" [...] episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo. [...] "200" [...] also demonstrates <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children. The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored.|$|E

500|$|In November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, {{followed}} by a second, Arthur Stanley—known as Stanley— in May 1854. Josephine's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and misogynist community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as [...] "the open acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> by the gentlemen of the university". Josephine was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Ruth in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Josephine saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a [...] "moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man"; {{she decided not to}} voice her feelings on the point but [...] "to speak little with men, but much with God". As a more practical measure she—and George—began to help many of the fallen woman of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at Newgate Prison. She had been seduced by a university don who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house {{at the end of her}} sentence.|$|E

2500|$|Some have {{described}} unequal treatment {{of humans and}} animals {{as a form of}} speciesism such as anthropocentrism or human-centeredness. Val Plumwood (1993, 1996) has argued that anthropocentrism plays a role in green theory that is analogous to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness [...] "anthropocentrism" [...] to emphasize this parallel. By analogy with racism and sexism, Melanie Joy has dubbed meat-eating [...] "carnism". The animal rights movement seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries. Peter Singer, in his ethical philosophy of {{what it is to be}} a [...] "person", argues that livestock animals feel enough to deserve better treatment than they receive. Many thinkers have questioned the morality not only of <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> underlying speciesism but also <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> underlying the fact that people support treatment of cows, pigs, and chickens that they would never allow with pet dogs, cats, or birds.|$|E
