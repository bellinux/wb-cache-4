5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent and}} the {{intensity}} of the movement took viceregal authorities by surprise. San Miguel and Celaya were captured with little resistance. On 21 September 1810, Hidalgo was proclaimed general and supreme commander after arriving to Celaya. At this point, Hidalgo's army numbered about 5,000. However, {{because of the lack of}} military discipline, the insurgents soon fell into robbing, looting and ransacking the towns they were capturing. They began to execute prisoners as well. This caused friction between Allende and Hidalgo as early as the capture of San Miguel in late September 1810. When a mob ran through this town, Allende tried to break up the violence by striking at the insurgents with <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> his sword. This brought a rebuke from Hidalgo, accusing Allende of mistreating the people.|$|E

25|$|Anawrahta was {{ruthless}} {{and stern}} not {{to any particular}} ethnic group but to all his subjects, for he felt that harsh measures were needed in building up a new nation. He never accepted {{the cult of the}} god-king, and he was impatient even with gods that his people worshipped; men came to say that he beat up gods with <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> his lance. He achieved his aims but only at the price of his own popularity. His subjects admired and feared him, but did not love him. His execution of two young heroes for a trifling breach of discipline after the conclusion of his Nanzhao campaign angered people, and to appease them he declared that the two dead heroes were now gods who could be worshipped. His forcing of Kyansittha to become fugitive increased his popularity although this action at least was justified for the great paladin, like the Lancelot of the Round Table, was in love with one of his queens.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of keyboard tone clusters {{is widely considered}} an [...] "extended technique"—large clusters require unusual playing methods often involving the fist, <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> the hand, or the forearm. Thelonious Monk and Karlheinz Stockhausen each performed clusters with their elbows; Stockhausen developed a method for playing cluster glissandi with special gloves. Don Pullen would play moving clusters by rolling {{the backs of his}} hands over the keyboard. Boards of various dimension are sometimes employed, as in the Concord Sonata ( [...] 1904–19) of Charles Ives; they can be weighted down to execute clusters of long duration.

500|$|There is {{also the}} solo piano piece Battle of Manassas, written in 1861 by [...] "Blind Tom" [...] Bethune and {{published}} in 1866.

[...] In 1887, Giuseppe Verdi became the first notable composer in the Western tradition to write an unmistakable chromatic cluster: the storm music with which Otello opens includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that also has the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture known. Still, it was not before the second {{decade of the twentieth}} century that tone clusters assumed a recognized place in Western classical music practice.|$|E

This is not done from the standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique, although it actually amounts to that, but rather because this is the only practicable method of playing such large chords.

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

A similar but smaller resort (also part of modern village of Klis) existed below Mount Greben on a plateau called Megdan.
