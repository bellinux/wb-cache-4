He subsequently {{took part in the}} Aitape–Wewak campaign, commanding a platoon {{until the end of the}} war. Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders had fewer rights as a citizen <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> Australians he led. He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around Maprik, and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of several acid hydrolases in different {{sections of the}} C. N. S. of various mammalian has been evaluated. The enzymes which have been studied are: beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, alpha-mannosidase. The enzymes show a higher activity in <b>the</b> gray matter <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>white</b> matter. <b>The</b> results are interpreted {{on the assumption that}} glyco-lipoprotein turnover is higher in <b>the</b> gray matter <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>white</b> matter, since myelin, which is the major component of <b>the</b> <b>white</b> matter, is a relatively stable structure...|$|R

25|$|To {{solve the}} problem, either {{formally}} or informally, one must assign probabilities {{to the events}} of drawing each of the six faces of the three cards. These probabilities could conceivably be very different; perhaps the white card is larger than the black card, or the black side of the mixed card is heavier <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> side. The statement of the question does not explicitly address these concerns. The only constraints implied by the Kolmogorov axioms are that the probabilities are all non-negative, and they sum to 1.|$|E
25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E
25|$|Swing {{balls are}} bowled {{with the same}} grip and {{technique}} as fast balls although the seam is usually angled slightly rather than straight, and the slower ball grip may be used. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball will spin in flight, varying {{the orientation of the}} shiny and rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in Test cricket swings more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> ball used in the one-day game.|$|E

25|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States, it is more common in the African American population <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Heligoland is a {{geological}} oddity; {{the presence of}} the main island's characteristic red sedimentary rock {{in the middle of the}} German Bight is unusual. It is the only such formation of cliffs along the continental coast of the North Sea. The formation itself, called the Bunter sandstone or Buntsandstein, is from the early Triassic geologic age. It is older <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> chalk that underlies the island Düne, the same rock that forms the white cliffs of Dover in England and cliffs of Danish and German islands in the Baltic Sea. In fact, a small chalk rock close to Heligoland, called witt Kliff (white cliff), is known to have existed within sight of the island to the west until the early 18th century, when storm floods finally eroded it to below sea level.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} {{plants are}} superficially {{quite similar to}} the white wood aster, but close examination as well as knowledge of the plants' differing habitats and ranges can readily distinguish them. The most similar species is the mountain wood aster (Eurybia chlorolepis), which was previously considered conspecfic with E. divaricata. E. chlorolepis differs in having flower stalks that are longer than 1.5cm, while those of E. divaricata are shorter than this. The involucres of the mountain wood aster are generally between 6.5 and 9mm in length, while those of the white wood aster are normally from 4.2 to 6.5mm long, but in rare cases they may be as long as 7.5mm. The mountain wood aster almost always has more rays <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> wood aster: the former usually has 12 to 16, but occasionally as few as 10, while the latter generally has 5 to 10 and never more than 12. The rays are also longer on the mountain wood aster at 17 to 18mm in most cases, while the white wood aster's are generally only 10 to 15mm. Lastly, E. chlorolepsis is present only from southern Virginia south to Georgia in the Appalachian Mountains at altitudes of , while E. divaricata can be found from southern Canada south to Alabama, meaning their ranges only overlap in the southern United States, and there only at high elevations.|$|E

This holds true in checking the levels of mastering English as well. While whites from Brazil, French Canada, and France show higher percentages of mastering the English language, those from Germany show lower percentages.|$|R
25|$|The {{state in}} 2010 {{had the highest}} {{proportion}} of African Americans in the nation. The African-American percentage of population has begun to increase due mainly to a younger population <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> (<b>the</b> total fertility rates of the two races are approximately equal). Due to patterns of settlement and whites putting their children in private schools, in almost all of Mississippi's public school districts, a majority of students are African American. African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern Yazoo Delta, and the southwestern and the central parts of the state. These are areas where, historically, African Americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the Civil War, or worked on cotton plantations and farms.|$|R

The trail passed up through camps until it reached a flat ledge, just before the main ascent, which was too steep for animals.
