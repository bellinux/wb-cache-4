5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar.

5000|$|When {{preparing}} proteins for consumption, {{there are}} three ways of denaturing the proteins: heating, acids, and mechanical force (e.g. whisking eggs). All three methods have the same result: hydrogen bonds in <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> are broken allowing <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> to [...] "unwind". When <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> are unwound, they have been altered from their natural state and are considered denatured.

40|$|The genome of {{measles virus}} (MV) is {{encapsidated}} by <b>the</b> nucleocapsid (N) <b>protein</b> and associates with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase {{to form the}} ribonucleoprotein complex. <b>The</b> matrix (M) <b>protein</b> is believed {{to play an important}} role in MV assembly by linking the ribonucleoprotein complex with envelope glycoproteins. Analyses using a yeast two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells revealed that <b>the</b> M <b>protein</b> interacts with <b>the</b> N <b>protein</b> and that two leucine residues at the carboxyl terminus of <b>the</b> N <b>protein</b> (L 523 and L 524) are critical for the interaction. In MV minigenome reporter gene assays, <b>the</b> M <b>protein</b> inhibited viral RNA synthesis only when it was able to interact with <b>the</b> N <b>protein.</b> <b>The</b> N <b>protein</b> colocalized with <b>the</b> M <b>protein</b> at <b>the</b> plasma membrane when <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> were coexpressed in plasmid-transfected or MV-infected cells. In contrast, <b>the</b> N <b>protein</b> formed small dots in the perinuclear area when it was expressed without <b>the</b> M <b>protein,</b> or it was incapable of interacting with <b>the</b> M <b>protein.</b> Furthermore, a recombinant MV possessing a mutant N protein incapable of interacting with <b>the</b> M <b>protein</b> grew much less efficiently than the parental virus. Since <b>the</b> M <b>protein</b> has an intrinsic ability to associate with the plasma membrane, it may retain the ribonucleoprotein complex at the plasma membrane by binding to <b>the</b> N <b>protein,</b> thereby stopping viral RNA synthesis and promoting viral particle production. Consequently, our results indicate that <b>the</b> M <b>protein</b> regulates MV RNA synthesis and assembly via its interaction with <b>the</b> N <b>protein...</b>|$|R

5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence.

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within <b>the</b> <b>protein,</b> providing initial phases.|$|E

5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in <b>the</b> <b>Protein</b> Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E

Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube.
