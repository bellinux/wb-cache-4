5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Same Language Subtitling (SLS) {{is the use}} of Synchronized Captioning of Musical Lyrics (or any {{text with}} an Audio/Video/ source) as a Repeated Reading {{activity}}. The basic reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected onscreen, while completing a response worksheet. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> effective, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, and better yet, subtitling should change color in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the text should be at a level to challenge students' language abilities.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{reached its}} climax in March 2003. On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and {{would do anything to}} make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E

500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. I {{think people are going}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E

I can't give too much away about the songs, but it's definitely going to represent the album because the album is very multilayered. It doesn't represent 'Your Body' as a single tone. It has its ballads; and everything comes from a very sincere, deeprooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|E

50|$|Filomena narrates. Just like Bruno and Buffalmacco, Calandrino {{was also}} in reality a 14th-century Italian Renaissance painter. However, Calandrino {{was known as a}} simpleton by his contemporaries. It is {{possible}} that this tale may be true and Boccaccio recorded it first. The test that Bruno and Buffalmacco submit Calandrino <b>to</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a medieval lie detector test and the tale is consistent with {{what we know about the}} characters of the three painters.|$|R
500|$|Manning {{had long}} {{complained about the}} lack of {{recognition}} she had received as a writer, and was not consoled when her husband and friends responded that her talent would be recognised, and her works read for years to come. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> famous now, Now", she retorted. As it happened, her renown and readership developed substantially after her death; a television serialisation of Fortunes of War starring Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh finally came to fruition in 1987, bringing her work to a wider audience.|$|E
500|$|When {{handing out}} scripts {{for the attack}} on the beach, Bender told the crew he and others [...] "wanted this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> big and really dramatic". They used arrows on wires to {{simulate}} hitting the fleeing victims, which included Neil Frogurt (Sean Whalen). A stunt double, Kim Koscki, was hired for the scene to stand in for Whalen; he applied anti-burn cream over his face and body for protection, and crew members waited nearby to quickly extinguish the flames once a scene was finished shooting. Due to the abundance of wires, the actors had to be careful when running, or risk tripping over them.|$|E

In December 2001, Columbia released the album Greatest Hits, which featured Carey's number one singles alongside songs she said [...] "needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> heard," [...] such as [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] and [...] "Forever." [...] In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album. [...] "There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day.

They chose a string of four consecutive shows from May 4 to May 7, 2005 at The Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois. The band recorded the four shows on a 24-track digital recorder. The shows were filmed for a potential DVD release, but the band decided not to release the footage. According to Tweedy, the band was disappointed by how the footage [...] "sapped" [...] the energy out of the performances. On September 13, 2005, the band announced that the album would be released on November 1, 2005. The release date was later delayed two weeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{documentary}} crew put wireless microphones {{on several}} of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of [...] "Subway". Many people involved with the show found the process extremely disruptive. In particular, Fleder said that he hates to be photographed and found the camera crew distracting and stressful. Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really,</b> really focused, and for me the thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E
