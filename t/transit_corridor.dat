5|$|World War I {{proved to}} be a boom for the Meråker Line. The line {{suddenly}} became a <b>transit</b> <b>corridor</b> for shipments from Russia, as well as from Sweden, to the ports in Trondheim and Hommelvik. To cope with the increased traffic, NSB had to both rent equipment from Sweden and acquire ten new Class 21 and Class 35 locomotives between 1913 and 1918. Four of these were transferred from other lines, while six were new. With the new locomotives, the dimensioned axle weight needed to be upgraded to , which mostly involved improving the bridges. The bridge at Funna was dismounted and sold to be used on the Gråkallen Line of the Trondheim Tramway. Class 35 was used on the Gudå–Storlien section, and replaced the aging Class 14. They remained in service until 1929, when they were transferred to the Ofoten Line.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{corridors}} in mitigating {{the effects}} of landscape fragmentation on biodiversity is controversial. Recent studies have highlighted {{the need for new}} approaches in corridor design using long-term datasets. We present a method to identify <b>transit</b> <b>corridors</b> for elephant at a population scale over a large area and {{an extended period of time}} using long-term aerial surveys. We investigated environmental and anthropogenic factors directly and indirectly related to the wet versus dry season distribution of elephant and its <b>transit</b> <b>corridors.</b> Four environmental variables predicted the presence of elephant at the landscape scale in both seasons: distance from permanent water, protected areas and settlements and vegetation structure. Path analysis revealed that altitude and monthly average NDVI, and distance from temporary water had a significant indirect effect on elephant distribution at local scale in dry and wet seasons respectively. Five <b>transit</b> <b>corridors</b> connecting Tarangire National Park and the northern as well as south-eastern wet season dispersal areas were identified and matched the wildlife migration routes described in the 1960 s. The corridors are stable over the decades, providing landscape connectivity for elephant. Our approach yielded insights how advanced spatial analysis can be integrated with biological data available from long-term datasets to identify actual <b>transit</b> <b>corridors</b> and predictors of species distribution...|$|R

However, the current rapid bus service by VTA does not fully qualify as BRT, {{due to the lack}} of separate ticketing stations and platforms, distinctive vehicles, and special lanes (which make BRT mimic more of a light rail or tram route, instead of a bus route). Rather, it serves as a temporary rapid bus service until VTA officially opens a BRT <b>transit</b> <b>corridor</b> along the same route, which will upgrade the current 522 route.|$|E

Kobayashi supported a [...] "rubber-tired" [...] mass transit system, {{as opposed to the}} conventional steel-wheel-on-steel-rail system chosen by the Hannemann administration. Prevedouros, on the other hand, opposed any mass transit project, favoring construction of a reversible tollway over the H-1, similar to the Managed Lane option studied in the Alternatives Analysis, and reworking existing road systems to ease congestion. [...] No candidate won a majority of votes in the September 20 non-partisan primary, forcing a runoff between Hannemann and Kobayashi; Hannemann successfully retained his post with 58% of the vote in the November 4 general election.|$|E
