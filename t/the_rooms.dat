The large reception rooms were lit by wrought-iron chandeliers from Spain.|$|E
5|$|The Provincial Museum of Newfoundland and Labrador (c. 1892–93) {{was located}} on Duckworth Street in a {{building}} designated as a heritage site by the City of St. John's. In 2005 the museum, along with the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador, moved into <b>The</b> <b>Rooms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rooms</b> is Newfoundland and Labrador's cultural facility, and {{is located in the}} downtown area.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> on {{the north}} and east sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of the}} private staircase.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> {{were not}} open to the general public, they could be {{accessed}} by appointment, with access being restricted to small groups. Even so, by the 1970s (with responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> having passed to the Department for the Environment in 1975) {{tens of thousands of}} requests to visit <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> were being received every year, of which only 5,000 were successful. Meanwhile, the atmospheric conditions of the site, being dry and dusty, were having a detrimental effect on the rooms' furnishings and historic maps and other documents. The prospect was raised of decanting the contents of <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> to an established museum, with the National Army Museum and Imperial War Museum being suggested as candidates. In the event, £7,000 was secured to conserve the material in situ.|$|E

5000|$|Any {{time the}} door is closed with the key outside <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> [...] "resets": {{everything}} {{that is not an}} Object disappears, including people. Multiple people can enter <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at once, but they must exit <b>the</b> <b>room</b> when <b>the</b> Key does. When <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> resets, any Objects in <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> will return to their original position {{at the time of the}} Event. A benefit of this is that an Object enclosed within something else, such as a safe, may be retrieved by leaving it inside and resetting <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> This can also be use to distinguish real Objects from fakes, since fakes will disappear.|$|R

5|$|Structure 34 is {{a pyramid}} in the North Acropolis {{that was built}} by Siyaj Chan K'awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three {{chambered}} shrine, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> situated one behind the other.|$|E
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> that separated <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> from each other.|$|E

5|$|The Great Palace II (or Gran Palacio II in Spanish) {{is another}} large {{residential}} complex, {{it is located}} on the southeast side of Plaza C. The palace is formed by a large number of small rooms arranged around seven interior courtyards. A large quantity of ceramic remains were recovered from within this palace. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> around the northeast courtyard within the Great Palace II may have been the royal apartments of this complex, owing to their position near the central courtyard {{while at the same time}} being closed off from it. The ceramics from this area were of exotic origin and elite nature. The royal apartments may also have included <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> around the north courtyard of the palace.|$|E
5|$|The Raymonds {{modified}} {{the house to}} create a more open plan feel, separated by Japanese fusuma partitions and shōji screens. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> were filled with objects of art, including rugs designed by Noémi and crockery by the Mingei designer Minagawa Masu.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the last mansio built at the site, and its associated bath-house, were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912–13. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> of both the mansio and bath-house were emptied and the stone foundations were exposed.

25|$|In Deathly Hallows, the {{students}} who {{need a place to}} hide from the Carrows, two Death Eater professors, use <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> It is also revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Requirement's current version can change while still occupied, though should a completely different version be required (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Hidden Things instead of DA Headquarters) <b>the</b> <b>room</b> must be empty. <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> can also answer to the desire of the wizard within <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> such as providing Harry with a whistle when he needed one during a Dumbledore's Army meeting, or creating a passage to the Hog's Head (as <b>the</b> <b>room</b> cannot produce food). Later, Ravenclaw's diadem is found to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and has been hidden in <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Hidden Things by Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter <b>the</b> <b>Room,</b> with Harry knowing that he must look for a place to hide things, and find the tiara; but they are ambushed by Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. The diadem is finally destroyed when Crabbe fills this version of <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> with what Hermione believes to have been Fiendfyre; a destructive magical fire. It is not known if <b>the</b> <b>room</b> continues to function after the events of Deathly Hallows; Ron expresses concern that it may have been ruined in all of its forms by the cursed fire.|$|R

5|$|A {{little further}} on, I found the older and smaller wall, {{which used to}} enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for ceremony. But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find {{his feet on the}} very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the {{crowding}} ghosts of many miserable years.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster Castle in 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was left empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting. During the Second World War the castle {{was used as a}} convalescent home for injured naval and American officers between 1943 and 1944.|$|E
25|$|To {{the left}} of the Entrance Hall, {{mirroring}} <b>the</b> Living <b>Room</b> is <b>the</b> Dining <b>Room.</b> <b>The</b> <b>room</b> features rounded curio cabinets in the north end corners of <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and black marble flooring in the center of <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> with carpet around the perimeter.

50|$|In addition, if {{water is}} {{condensed}} in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of heat}} previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> (<b>the</b> latent heat of vaporization). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with an evaporative cooler, and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and reduce <b>the</b> relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.|$|R
