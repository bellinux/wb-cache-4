5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost <b>to</b> <b>space</b> when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{hypothesis}} {{put forth}} by Richard Lindzen is the iris hypothesis in which an increase in tropical sea surface temperatures results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted <b>to</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed <b>to</b> <b>space</b> for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E

5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives <b>to</b> <b>space</b> births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed <b>to</b> <b>Space</b> Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto considers Space Invaders to be {{the game}} that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. John Romero and John Carmack cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games. Several publications ascribed {{the expansion of the}} video game industry from a novelty into a global industry {{to the success of the}} game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores <b>to</b> <b>Space</b> Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.|$|E

5|$|In December 1966, the AS-205 {{mission was}} canceled, since the {{validation}} of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted <b>to</b> <b>space</b> experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.|$|E
5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters {{that can be}} both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text {{along the bottom of}} the screen. They were first introduced in Tales of Destiny, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but were cut due <b>to</b> <b>space</b> issues. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
