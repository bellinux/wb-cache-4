40|$|Abstract. Dimensional {{precision}} is {{a critical}} parameter in net shape processing of ferrous PM components. Beyond the dimensional changes associated with pressing and sintering of typical low alloy PM steels, sinter-hardening alloys undergo a transformation from austenite to martensite. The formation of martensite results in a large expansion during cooling, as martensite is the lowest density phase in steels. <b>Tempering</b> <b>hardened</b> steels results in shrinkage, as the martensite converts to a ferrite and carbide microstructure of higher density. Both of these transformations have a large impact on the dimensional change. In addition, martensitic regions with high Cu and C contents may contain large amounts of retained austenite. As austenite is the highest density phase, retained austenite results in less growth of the compact. The presence of martensite and retained austenite, {{in addition to the}} tempering step, all {{play a role in the}} final dimensions of a component.

40|$|Ductile iron is {{a special}} type of cast iron family which differs from other cast iron {{in the manner of}} {{ductility}} since others are brittle in nature. Ductile iron (DI) is gaining its popularity in many industrial applications due to its strength and considerable amount of ductility which is {{because of the presence of}} spheroidal graphite in microstructure. Fracture is very common in almost every industry and field of application and analysis of fracture now-a-days has become essential for optimizing the product life span. The current study is focused no investigating the mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of ductile iron subjected to various heat treatment processes. Tensile and impact specimens are machined from a test block according to ASTM E 8 and ASTM D 256 standards respectively. Specimens are austenitized at 1000 °C, followed by different rate of cooling and quenching. The austenitizing time being 90 minutes and quenching media are mineral oil, air and salt bath for tempering, normalizing and austempering processes respectively. Isothermal annealing is also carried out in some specimens to have comparison between mechanical properties and behaviour of the material. The tempering and austempering temperature is 500 °C and time being 2 hrs and 4 hrs respectively. Tensile test has been performed using INSTRON- 1195 and Izod Impact test is performed using Izod impact tester. Vickers’s hardness is determined by application of 20 kg with 10 sec. dwell time using Vickers’s Hardness Tester.

50|$|Martensitic transformation, more {{commonly}} known as quenching and <b>tempering,</b> is a <b>hardening</b> mechanism specific for steel. The steel must be heated to a temperature where the iron phase changes from ferrite into austenite, i.e. changes crystal structure from BCC (body-centered cubic) to FCC (face-centered cubic). In austenitic form, steel can dissolve a lot more carbon. Once the carbon has been dissolved, the material is then quenched. It is important to quench with a high cooling rate so that the carbon does {{not have time to}} form precipitates of carbides. When the temperature is low enough, the steel tries to return to the low temperature crystal structure BCC. This change is very quick since it does not rely on diffusion and is called a martensitic transformation. Because of the extreme supersaturation of solid solution carbon, the crystal lattice becomes BCT (body-centered tetragonal) instead. This phase is called martensite, and is extremely hard due to a combined effect of the distorted crystal structure and the extreme solid solution strengthening, both mechanisms of which resist slip dislocation.|$|R
