5|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the expedition and {{with the majority of}} his forces in his way back, Przemysł II received a confidential message that the fortress of Drezdenko was protected by only a few German knights. The young prince, {{despite the fact that he}} only had a part of his forces, decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> attack. This completely surprised the defenders and fearing the same fate of soldiers from Strzelce Krajeńskie, they decided to surrender the fortress in exchange for a full pardon. After this, Przemysł II took the fortress in the name of his uncle and triumphantly returned home.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it hard for him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased {{to be able to}} support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{establishing}} a centralized empire, Saladin had established hereditary ownership throughout his lands, dividing his empire among his kinsmen, {{with family members}} presiding over semi-autonomous fiefs and principalities. Although these princes (emirs) owed allegiance to the Ayyubid sultan, they maintained relative independence in their own territories. Upon Saladin's death, az-Zahir took Aleppo from al-Adil per the arrangement and al-Aziz Uthman held Cairo, while his eldest son, al-Afdal retained Damascus, which also included Palestine and much of Mount Lebanon. Al-Adil then acquired al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), where he held the Zengids of Mosul at bay. In 1193, Mas'ud of Mosul joined forces with Zangi II of Sinjar and together the Zengid coalition moved to conquer al-Jazira. However, before any major results could be achieved, Mas'ud fell ill and returned to Mosul, and al-Adil then compelled Zangi <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> peace before the Zengids suffered territorial losses {{at the hands of}} the Ayyubids. Al-Adil's son al-Mu'azzam took possession of Karak and Transjordan.|$|E
50|$|As {{consumers}} {{approach the}} actual purchase decision, {{they are more}} likely to rely on personal sources of information. For this reason, personal sales representatives must be well versed in giving sales pitches and in tactics used to close the sale. Methods used might include: ‘social evidence’, where the salesperson refers to previous success and satisfaction from other customers buying the product. ‘Scarcity attraction’ is another technique, where the salesperson mentions that the offer is limited, as it forces the consumer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> decision, and therefore less time evaluating alternatives.|$|R

40|$|In aquaculture, {{the feeding}} costs {{represent}} around 30 - 40 % {{of the total}} production costs. Therefore some sort of action to rationalize this production aspect could bring significant economic improvements. Although many fish farmers know the meaning and purpose of the feed conversion monitoring, many of them neglect {{to keep it in}} check and by doing so they lose serious opportunities of bigger profits which could be obtained with a better rationalization of this process. This article aims to help farmers and technicians to become more aware of the instruments available to them to monitor the feed conversion and to restate its great economic importance. An overview of methods together with some instruction <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> and frequent check of DGR and FCR curves are described in the present article...|$|R
5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> escape.|$|E

25|$|An illegal {{method of}} saving {{penalties}} {{is for the}} goalkeeper <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and short jump forward just before the penalty taker connects with the ball. This not only shuts down {{the angle of the}} shot, but also distracts the penalty taker. The method was used by Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel. FIFA was less strict on the rule during that time. In more recent times, FIFA has advised all referees to strictly obey the rule book.|$|E

This was a serious threat to the entire family, but Humayun and Kamran squabbled over how to proceed.

25|$|With {{its large}} budget, {{the film was}} not a {{financial}} success. Because of this, Martine Marignac wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> inexpensive film; Rivette, short of ideas, began assembling a cast. He contacted Nathalie Richard, Marianne Denicourt and Laurence Côte, who gave him {{an idea for a}} film about 1920s New York City taxi dance halls; this led to 1995's Up, Down, Fragile. Richard, Denicourt and Côte star as three women struggling to overcome personal obstacles, with musical numbers at a mysterious nightclub commenting on their lives. In the film, a nod to 1920s and 1930s Hollywood backstage musicals, Anna Karina appears as a nightclub singer whose songs refer to her previous films with Godard. Up, Down, Fragile was screened at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.|$|E

30|$|In {{marketing}} research, {{the most}} frequently used theoretical models to investigate the relationship between price and perceived value, such as the price–quality–value model (Monroe and Krishnan 1985) and the means-end model (Zeithaml 1988), are in a cognitive approach. However, Holbrook and Hirschman (1982) argued that most human beings are intrinsically pleasure seeking. In many situations when consumers make purchase decisions, they seek affective benefits, such as arousal, excitement, and stimulation. In addition to the affect-as-information model (Clore et al. 2001), which can support the effect of affect on perceived value, the affect heuristic also supports the importance of affect in perceived value. The affect heuristic (Slovic et al. 2007) indicates that emotion {{can be used as a}} mental shortcut that allows people <b>to</b> <b>make</b> decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. In the context of price discounts, Aydinli et al. (2014) found that price promotion lowered consumers’ motivation to use mental effort. When a price promotion is offered, consumers are more likely to depend on affect than on extensive information processing (recalling product information and spending time considering choice options) <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> and easier purchase decision.|$|R

500|$|The {{club was}} {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> {{return to the}} Premiership in the 2005–06 season, but poor performances began to turn the fans against Worthington.

Half of Ashton's fee was immediately reinvested in the purchase of Welsh striker Robert Earnshaw, who helped the Canaries' revival to a ninth-place finish. Worthington made just one permanent signing prior to the 2006–07 season, and when a poor run of form ensued, leaving the club in 17th place in the Championship, he was dismissed.

Dean Ashton was sold for a club-record £7M, approximately a 100% profit on the fee they had paid just one year earlier. Half of Ashton's fee (£3.5M) was immediately reinvested in the purchase of Welsh striker Robert Earnshaw, who helped the Canaries' revival to a ninth-place finish. Worthington made just one permanent signing in the close season, and when a poor run of form ensued, leaving the club in 17th place in the Championship, Worthington was dismissed.
