5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both the media and <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b> Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E

25|$|As a {{city council}} member, Cisneros took {{assorted}} populist positions {{on such issues}} as dealing with labor, water, education, and housing, among others.

50|$|It {{has been}} accepted, {{at least by}} <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>communities</b> in Europe, that the media has little {{interest}} in covering {{the positive aspects of}} Latino-American culture, and that if important events are covered, it is mostly done under the European viewpoint.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the chattel {{slavery in}} the antebellum {{southern}} United States (which is predominantly non-Catholic except Louisiana, the Mobile area in Alabama, and <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community),</b> where slaves were often considered less than human, the law in Latin American countries gave slaves legal rights. The Church also treated them as fully human {{with respect to the}} sacraments; for example, they could marry and even receive holy orders.|$|E
25|$|This book {{generated}} major controversy within <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> {{before it}} was even published because of an inflammatory article in the New York Post (Dec. 19, 2006, p.8) announcing its release. In the book Badillo criticizes what he perceives as a lax work ethic among Hispanics, who he contends do not value education as much as other immigrants just as historically impoverished but more successful, such as Asian-Americans.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Radio Bilingüe {{experienced}} {{a development that}} marked a major expansion for the organization: It launched Satélite Radio Bilingüe, which enabled satellite transmission of its programming throughout the United States. This meant the radio station could reach many more of <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>communities</b> living across rural and urban areas in the country.

25|$|The Day of the Dead {{has taken}} a {{political}} bent when used to mourn those who have died from the political violence.

25|$|Blackface {{performances}} are not unusual within <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b> A minstrel tradition exists {{throughout most of}} Latin America and Spain, and it has traveled to the United States. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. A {{case in point is}} the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.|$|E
25|$|The {{horse racing}} venues Hollywood Park Racetrack and Los Alamitos Race Course were also shut down. L.A. Fiesta Broadway, {{a major event}} in <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community,</b> was not held in the first weekend in May as scheduled.

25|$|The Teatro Puerto Rico {{was music}} hall focused into <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> in the South Bronx section of New York City. During the 1940s to 1950s it precented la farándula, a vaudeville-style package of Spanish-language events, and {{attracted}} entertainers {{from all over}} Latin America. In the late 1960s, the neighborhood where the theater was located was in decline and the theater closed its doors until 1994. That year {{a real estate developer}} invested funds in renovations. After two years in operation, a political scandal involving misappropriated public funds forced the permanent closure of the theater as such. The building which the theater once occupied, however, is now being used as a place of religious worship.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Stavans {{published}} in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia a Spanglish translation of {{the first chapter of}} Cervantes’ Don Quixote de la Mancha. The translation has been controversial throughout the world, garnishing celebrations and attacks. Critics accuse Stavans of using Spanglish to call attention to himself. Supporters say that the translation is an indication that <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> in the United States has come of age. Stavans has responded to the reactions with interviews in which he argues that Spanglish is today’s manifestation of “mestizaje,” the crossbreeding of racial, social, and cultural traits of Anglos and Latinos similar to what occurred during the colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth century.|$|E
25|$|While male activists held {{leadership}} roles and more authority, the women activists participated in volunteering and teaching valuable skills to individuals of <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b> By the 1960s, Huerta and others began to shift {{their attention to}} the labor exploitation of Latino farm workers in California and began to strike, demonstrate, and organize to fight for a myriad of issues that Mexican laborers faced. While many of the male leaders of the movement had the role of being dynamic, powerful speakers that would inspire others to join the movement, the women devoted their efforts to negotiating better working contracts with companies, organizing boycotts, rallying for changes in immigration policies, registering Latinos to vote with Spanish language ballots, and increasing pressure on legislation to improve labor relations.|$|E

25|$|Many {{communities}} in Los Angeles {{have changed their}} ethnic character over this period of time. For many decades, the population was predominantly white and mostly American-born until the late 20th Century. South L.A. was mostly white until the 1950s, but then became predominantly black until the 1990s, and is now mainly Latino. While <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> within the City of Los Angeles was once centered on the Eastside, it now extends throughout the city. The San Fernando Valley, which represented a bastion of white flight in the 1960s and provided the votes that allowed Sam Yorty to defeat the first election run by Tom Bradley, is now as ethnically diverse {{as the rest of}} the city on the other side of the Hollywood Hills.|$|E

25|$|According to the United States Census Bureau the city's {{poverty rate}} of 19 percent in 2004 {{had not changed}} since 2001, while in Manhattan the {{earnings}} of the top fifth of earners ($330,244 on average) were 41 times the earnings of the bottom fifth ($8,019 on average). Bronx County is the second poorest urban county in the United States, with a per capita income of $13,595 (after El Paso County, Texas); Kings County, which is coterminous with Brooklyn, has a per capita of $16,775, which {{is lower than the}} 2000 per capita income of New Orleans. In 2004, the Census' American Community Survey reported, Latinos had the highest poverty rate in the city (29 percent), compared to Blacks (21 percent), Asians (18 percent) and non-Latino Whites (11 percent). Although in 2005 Latinos made up 28 percent of the New York City's total population, they made up 42 percent of its poverty population. The Mayor's Commission, however, was criticized by advocacy groups like the National Institute for Latino Policy, for not addressing the problem of high and persistent poverty in <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> <b>community,</b> pointing to the underrepresentation of Latinos on the Commission (only 4 out of 32 commissioners are Latino) and its leadership (no Latinos).|$|E
