5|$|A July 1861 address <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Bourbon County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states {{to remain in}} the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Shelley {{worked in}} Seremban in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, until May 1965. He then {{returned}} to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes, subsequently starting his own machinery-importing business. He also served on the Public Service Commission (PSC) for over three decades, from 1976 to 2007. The PSC is a body created by the Constitution of Singapore that appoints, promotes, dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore. It has additional responsibility for planning and administering scholarships provided by the Government of Singapore. Shelley was involved in interviewing civil servants as well as students seeking scholarships; {{he wrote a book}} entitled How to Interview Well and Get that Job! (2004). For service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Singapore, the Government conferred the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) on him in 1978, awarding an additional Bar the following year.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life {{in the same way that}} the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code.

5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
