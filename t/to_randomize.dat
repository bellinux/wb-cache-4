As the fixed dimensions of the chamber, and its physical closeness to the magnetron, would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, a motorized fan-like stirrer {{is placed in the}} waveguide <b>to</b> <b>randomize</b> the pattern.

25|$|In {{games with}} mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the {{probability}} of a player choosing any particular strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing <b>to</b> <b>randomize,</b> their expected payoff for each strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.|$|E
25|$|The lottery is {{conducted}} with witnesses (from {{the accounting firm}} Ernst & Young) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine. The balls are placed in the machine for 20 seconds <b>to</b> <b>randomize</b> before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three balls are drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine {{the second and third}} picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. When the first three teams have been determined, the remaining picks are given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assures each team that it can drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.|$|E

500|$|Jonasson's game {{design was}} {{inspired}} by real-time strategy game Command & Conquer, where he enjoyed managing his home base but not attacking the enemy. He designed the game to last 45 minutes, which he felt to be a proper length, whereupon the difficulty ramps up to require station defense over base construction. He {{felt that it was}} reasonable to reach all four monoliths within that time to be ready for the endgame sequence, and that the limit made players expand outwards rather than keeping the station small and easy to defend. The sole map is hand-balanced, which made him reluctant to fulfill player requests <b>to</b> <b>randomize</b> it. He also considered adding a [...] "zen" [...] mode, which would pressure the player less. The music was composed by Niklas Ström.|$|E
500|$|Rogue {{was written}} by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy in 1980 while {{students}} at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The game was inspired by Toy's prior experience in playing the 1971 Star Trek game and programming clones of it for various other computer systems. It was also inspired by interactive fiction Adventure. While {{looking for a way}} <b>to</b> <b>randomize</b> the experience of Adventure, they came across Ken Arnold's curses library that enabled them to better manipulate characters on the terminal screen, prompting Toy and Wichman to create a graphical-like randomized adventure game. They created the story of the game by having the player seek out the [...] "Amulet of Yendor", [...] "Yendor" [...] being [...] "Rodney" [...] spelled backwards, the name of the wizard they envisioned had created the dungeon. Rogue was originally executed on a VAX-11/780 computer; its limited memory forced them to use a simple text-based interface for the game. Toy eventually dropped out of school but got a job at the computing labs at University of California, Berkeley, where he met with Arnold. Arnold helped to optimize the curses code and implement more features into the game.|$|E

2500|$|The game's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Stan LePard, conducted by Adam Stern, and {{performed by the}} Northwest Sinfonia. [...] The game's music was written to be [...] "period" [...] music true to the 1930s without being too derivative of any one particular style or composer. [...] According to Stan LePard, the soundtrack takes inspiration from various sources, including Errol Flynn swashbucklers and the concert music of Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss. [...] In composing the game's music, LePard chose to incorporate complex harmonies into his music so that the various tracks could be linked without having {{to make sure that}} the keys of the two pieces complimented each other. [...] This allows the game <b>to</b> <b>randomize</b> the order of the game's battle themes and avoid looping the music in a predictable order. [...] Initially, the game was to exclusively feature big band music. [...] The resulting music was lighter in tone than the game required, so developers considered an orchestra in order to achieve a more cinematic approach. [...] As a result, the audio team hired a full forty-piece orchestra to record the game's music.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in analytical chemistry have enabled high-precision measurements of multiply substituted isotopologues (or 'clumped isotopologues') like 13CH3D. This {{emerge as a}} novel tool for studying methane formation. This proxy {{is based on the}} abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane, which should be enriched compared to the stochastic distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium because the reduced zero-point energy for heavy-heavy isotope bonding is more than twice the reduced zero-point energy of heavy-light isotope bonding. The extent of enrichment decreases with increasing temperature, as higher entropy tends <b>to</b> <b>randomize</b> isotope distribution. [...] Stolper et al. established this temperature calibration using laboratory equilibrated methane and field methane from known formation temperature, and applied this to several gas reservoirs to study natural gas formation and mixing. Wang et al. also reported strong non-equilibrium isotope effect in methane clumped isotopes from lab-cultured methanogens and field samples. These methane samples have relatively low abundance of clumped isotopologues, sometimes even lower than the stochastic distribution. This indicates that there are irreversible steps in enzymatic reactions during methanogenesis that fractionation against clumped isotopologues to create the depleted signal. Isotope clumping in methane has proven a robust proxy, and scientists are now moving towards higher-order alkane molecules like ethane for further work.|$|E
