60|$|What {{you advise}} {{in respect to}} a {{separate}} publication of my Church Poetry, I have often turned in my own mind; but I have really done so little in that way compared with {{the magnitude of the}} subject, that I have not courage to venture on such a publication. Besides, it would not, I fear, pay its expenses. The Sonnets were so published upon the recommendation of a deceased nephew of mine, one of the first scholars of Europe, and as good as he was learned. The volume did not, I believe, clear itself, and a great part of the impression, though latterly offered at a reduced price, still remains, I believe, in Mr. Moxon's hands. In this country people who do not grudge laying out their money for new publications on personal or fugitive interests, that every one is <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>are</b> very unwilling to part with it for literature which is unindebted to temporary excitement. If they buy such at all, it must be in some form for the most part that has little to recommend it but low price.|$|E

5000|$|Many media {{agencies}} in the U.S. {{and around the world}} were criticized for using the word [...] "refugee" [...] to describe someone that was displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Many, particularly African-Americans, have argued that using the term [...] "refugee" [...] implies a sort of [...] "second class" [...] status, while others have argued that using terms such as [...] "evacuees" [...] or [...] "displaced" [...] is too clinical and not dramatic enough to portray the current situation. President Bush addressed this issue in the following statement: [...] "The people we're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>are</b> not refugees. They are Americans and they need the help and love and compassion of our fellow citizens." [...] Accordingly, most of the major media outlets in the U.S. eliminated the usage of [...] "refugees", with a few exceptions.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Meades: Abroad Again in Britain {{was shown}} on BBC Two in May 2007. [...] It is {{a sequel to}} his 1990s series {{exploring}} British architecture. The film examines Salisbury Cathedral, Edinburgh Castle, Cragside, Brighton Pavilion and Portsmouth Dockyard. It uses his familiar style of jaunty camera angles often showing him from behind, going down escalators, sitting on walls or even not at all as he is {{walking away from the}} camera. He talks directly to the camera and often his speeches are split up from different angles or positions. There are times of silence or with only music where shots of the building he is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>are</b> shown. Equally he often uses scathing remarks to criticise other buildings such as an occasion when he refers to the Millennium Dome as a [...] "Museum of Toxic Waste".|$|E

5000|$|Fake news is a neologism, used {{to refer}} to {{fabricated}} news. This type of news, found in traditional news, social media or fake news websites, has no basis in fact, but is presented as being factually accurate. Michael Radutzky, a producer of CBS 60 Minutes, said his show considers fake news to be [...] "stories that are provably false, have enormous traction appeal in the culture, and are consumed by millions of people". He did not include fake news that is [...] "invoked by politicians against the media for stories that they don't like or for comments that they don't like". Guy Campanile, also a 60 Minutes producer said, [...] "What we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>are</b> stories that are fabricated out of thin air. By most measures, deliberately, and by any definition, that's a lie." [...] The intention and purpose behind fake news is important. In some cases, what appears to be fake news may in fact be news satire, which uses exaggeration and introduces non-factual elements, and is intended to amuse or make a point, rather than to deceive. Propaganda can also be fake news.|$|E
