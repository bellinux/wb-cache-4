5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Non-musical subjects, both {{religious}} and numerological, influenced Sorabji's music, too, {{and he took}} inspiration from various sources. His Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, and his Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone has seven movements titled after <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> centres of Tantric and Shaktic yoga. The song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text of a Catholic benediction. However, Sorabji did not intend the first two of these works to be programmatic, and he heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music. Nevertheless, some of his works {{have been described as}} programmatic.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a {{conservative}} evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} substitutionary atonement, <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by {{the vast majority of the}} Protestant churches and their clergy.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E

50|$|This {{is similar}} to <b>the</b> {{concepts}} of <b>bodily</b> humors in <b>the</b> Tibetan Medical tradition and the Indian Ayurvedic system, which both relate health and disease to the balance and imbalance of <b>the</b> three <b>bodily</b> humors, generally translated as wind, bile, and phlegm. This is also similar to the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang that an imbalance of the two polarities caused ailment.|$|R
25|$|All sexual {{behaviors}} that involve contact with <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> fluids {{of another person}} should be considered to contain some risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

25|$|Although the Assumption {{was only}} {{recently}} defined as dogma, accounts of <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> assumption of Mary into heaven have circulated {{since at least}} the 5th century and by the 8th century saints Andrew of Crete and John of Damascus had declared belief in it. The Book of Revelation (12:1) has been interpreted as referring to it; with her coronation implying her previous bodily assumption to heaven.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the general}} {{location}} of his burial is known, Daniil's grave was never rediscovered. According to one account, Aiud prisoners {{working on a}} ditch in the 1960s dug up a shackle-wearing skeleton, and were convinced that it belonged to their spiritual leader. <b>The</b> <b>bodily</b> remains are still judged irretrievable, and he is commemorated together with other prisoners with whom he presumably shares an improvised grave in Aiud.|$|E

25|$|One neurochemical {{indicator}} of sleep debt is adenosine, a neurotransmitter that inhibits many of <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> processes associated with wakefulness. Adenosine levels {{increase in the}} cortex and basal forebrain during prolonged wakefulness and decrease during the sleep-recovery period, potentially acting as a homeostatic regulator of sleep. Coffee and caffeine temporarily block the effect of adenosine, prolong sleep latency, and reduce total sleep time and quality.|$|E
25|$|The Assumption of Mary into Heaven, often {{shortened}} to the Assumption {{and also}} known as the Feast of Saint Mary the Virgin, Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the Falling Asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary (the Dormition), according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and parts of Anglicanism, was <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven {{at the end of her}} earthly life.|$|E
25|$|Pope Pius XII's {{previous}} encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae (1 May 1946) to all Catholic bishops {{stated that}} for a long time past, numerous petitions had been received from cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests, religious of both sexes, associations, universities and innumerable private persons, all begging that <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> Assumption into heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and proclaimed as a dogma of faith. This was also fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in the Vatican Council (1869–1870).|$|E

25|$|Ujjayi {{breathing}} {{may be used}} continuously throughout Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and {{is frequently}} used in Power Yoga and Vinyasa, or Flow Yoga. This breath enables the practitioner to maintain a rhythm {{to his or her}} practice, take in enough oxygen, and helps build energy to maintain practice, while clearing toxins out of <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> system. This breath is especially important during transition into and out of asanas (postures), as it helps practitioners to stay present, self-aware and grounded in the practice, which lends it a meditative quality.|$|E
25|$|Smith wrote several {{accounts}} of the vision beginning in 1832, {{but none of the}} accounts were published until the 1840s. Though Smith had described other visions, the First Vision was essentially unknown to early Latter Day Saints; Smith's experience did not become important in the Latter Day Saint movement until the early-20th century, when it became the embodiment of the Latter Day Saint restoration. The First Vision also corroborated distinctive Mormon doctrines such as <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> nature of God the Father and the uniqueness of Mormonism as the only true path to salvation.|$|E
25|$|Mainly {{pastoral}} in nature, the Mariology of Alphonsus Liguori rediscovers, integrates and {{defends the}} Mariology of Augustine and Ambrose and other fathers and represents an intellectual defence of Mariology {{in the eighteenth}} century. Liguori promoted the doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> Assumption of Mary into Heaven, arguing that Jesus would not have wanted his mother's body corrupted in flesh, for {{that would have been}} a dishonour, given that he had himself been born of the Virgin, and hence Mary must have been assumed into Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{deficiencies}} {{may include}} problems identifying, processing, describing, {{and working with}} one's own feelings, often marked {{by a lack of}} understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.|$|E
25|$|When {{morning was}} come {{they set up}} an eagle at the eastern gate, and {{erecting}} an altar of victory they celebrated appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition: to the one whom they venerate as their god of Victory they give the name of Mars, and <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> characteristics of Hercules, imitating his physical proportion by means of wooden columns, and {{in the hierarchy of}} their gods he is the Sun, or as the Greeks call him, Apollo. From this fact the opinion of those men appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use even to this day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.|$|E
25|$|Herrnhaag was a {{community}} {{designed by the}} elder Zinzendorf, whose inhabitants were to live under the direct rule of Christ with Christian Renatus as his representative. At Herrnhaag, Christel was {{the link between the}} spiritual and the earthly as the spirit took human form. During the 1748 Single Brothers Festival at Herrnhaag, Christel and his assistants entered wearing white robes, implying it was Christ who was actually entering. Later that day, Christel and twelve assistants led Communion, further representing Christ and the apostles. During the service, those in attendance believed that the Sidehole of Christ was literally standing before them in <b>the</b> <b>bodily</b> forms of Christel and Rubusch, his co-leader of the brothers. Christel sang a welcoming hymn for Christ entering the hall, and while kissing, the brothers believed they were literally kissing the Sidehole.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea that}} {{personality}} traits were inherited through blood types date {{as far back}} as Aristotle. Hippocrates also sought to link personality biologically, linking traits with <b>the</b> four <b>bodily</b> humors—sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{physical}} kinetic interaction of a shape-changing interface (SCI) for <b>the</b> enrichment of <b>bodily</b> activity in a therapeutic context. In recent years, {{the use of}} human bodily movement as a major modality for a game interface has been explored {{in the field of}} interaction design, even in a therapeutic context. Previously, we developed MoleBot [2], a SCI based on an XY stage system, which uses the change {{in the shape of a}} table surface to embody only the user’s movements via kinetic interaction. Here, we explore questions regarding how an SCI can enrich bodily experience, and what elements of an SCI need to be designed in order to motivate and amplify <b>the</b> user’s <b>bodily</b> experience in a therapeutic context. Thus, we conducted a co-design process with therapists with the aim of promoting <b>the</b> user’s <b>bodily</b> experience using an SCI. (figure 1...|$|R
