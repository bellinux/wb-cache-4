5|$|On {{the night}} of 23 October New Jersey steamed north to rearm before taking up {{position}} {{in support of the}} 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day New Jersey engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at New Jersey with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at New Jersey; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information New Jersey fired five 16inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.|$|E
25|$|Multnomah County police {{consistently}} suspected {{foul play}} in the Martins' disappearance, {{based on the evidence}} of the <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> that indicated the family's vehicle was deliberately pushed from the cliff. Also troubling were the reported sightings of the family at dusk on the north bank of the river in Washington state, while the <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> placed them {{on the south side of}} the river in Oregon; this would suggest that their car would have fallen over the cliff after nightfall. The arrest of the two ex-convicts in the Hood River area the day after the family's disappearance, for car theft, was also noted, though police were unable to determine if the incidents were related.|$|E
25|$|Two men who {{initially}} attracted police attention {{in connection with}} the murders were Fred Reynolds and Lorenzo Montoya. Reynolds was a pimp who knew one of the missing women and reportedly had photos of missing sex workers; he died of natural causes in January 2009. Lorenzo Montoya lived less than three miles from the burial site. In 2006 there were reportedly <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> leading from his trailer to the site. In December 2006, Montoya strangled a teenager at his trailer and then was shot to death by the teen's boyfriend.|$|E

25|$|Climactichnites is {{the name}} given to surface trails and burrows that consist {{of a series of}} {{chevron-shaped}} raised cross bars that are usually flanked on either side by a parallel ridge. They somewhat resemble <b>tire</b> <b>tracks,</b> and are larger (typically about four inches wide) than most of the other trace fossils made by invertebrates. The trails were produced on sandy tidal flats during Cambrian time. While the identity of the animal is still conjectural, {{it may have been a}} large slug-like animal - its trails produced as it crawled over and processed the wet sand to obtain food.|$|E
25|$|After the {{discovery}} of Martin's body, approximately 75 state troopers combed the area in search of clues. However, no <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> were seen near the site where her body was found, and the burlap bag proved to be of no use in identifying any suspects. According to The Citizens' Voice, burned cloth matching the clothing Martin was wearing when she was last seen was discovered at an abandoned sawmill near Forkston. However, an article in The Kane Republican stated {{that this was not}} the origin of the cloth. An incident involving a bundle of clothing being thrown from a car near Orwigsburg proved to be unrelated to Martin's killing.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} the time machine is the same in all three films. The {{operator}} is seated inside the DeLorean (except the first time, when a remote control is used), and turns on the time circuits, activating a unit containing multiple fourteen- and seven-segment displays that show the destination (red), present (green), and last-departed (yellow) dates and times. After entering a target date, the operator accelerates the car to , which activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. Surrounded by electrical current similar to a Tesla coil, the whole car vanishes {{in a flash of}} white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of fiery <b>tire</b> <b>tracks.</b> A digital speedometer is attached to the dashboard so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past by fans of the movie franchise for why the car has to be moving at 88mph to achieve temporal displacement, but actually the production crew chose the velocity simply because they liked how it looked on the speedometer.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>tire</b> <b>track</b> eels {{are often}} {{combined}} with medium to large-sized gouramis, knifefish, danios, loaches, Loricariids, eartheaters, acaras, Cichlasomines and Asian catfishes {{in a community}} fish aquarium, they are not normally mixed with small-sized fish, because <b>tire</b> <b>track</b> eels are observed to prey upon smaller fish. Mixing them with fish belonging to the same species is also not recommended. This {{is because they are}} aggressive to members of the same fish family but peaceful to other fish species with similar care level requirements, size and temperament.|$|R

25|$|The {{first known}} victim was 45-year-old Laquetta Gunther, who {{was found in}} an alley on December 26, 2005. She {{had been shot in}} the back of the head. DNA was {{recovered}} from the scene. The second victim was 34-year-old Julie Green, found January 14, 2006. She had also been shot in the back of the head. No DNA was recovered, but <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> were found. The tires were for a 2003 Taurus or Sable and in fact the exact tires were later found. Just over a month later, on February 24, 2006 police found the body of Iwana Patton, 35, on a dirt road. She had been shot, but not in the back of the head, and possibly had struggled with her killer. DNA was recovered, along with a shell casing that allowed police to identify the make and model of pistol used. (.40-caliber Smith & Wesson Sigma Series VE.) Ballistics from recovered bullets and recovered DNA matched. Authorities received an anonymous telephone call describing the location of Patton's body, but the caller was eventually identified and questioned, and is not a suspect in the killings. All three women are believed to have worked as sex workers in the Daytona Beach area. Police believe the victims voluntarily accompanied their killer, possibly in a vehicle, and were subsequently murdered and dumped in the same area of Daytona Beach. The killer did not attempt to conceal the bodies.|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 1959, {{three months}} after the <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> were reported, a river {{drilling}} rig near The Dalles reportedly hooked something of substantial weight to its anchor; however, it became dislodged before it could be pulled to the surface.

2500|$|Three {{months after}} the family's disappearance, a {{volunteer}} searcher found <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> leading off of a cliff near The Dalles, Oregon, which reportedly matched the tires on the Martins' Ford Squire. This conflicted with the eyewitness reports that had placed the family on the north {{bank of the river}} at nightfall, which would indicate that they had crossed the river into Washington state in either Hood River via the Hood River Bridge, or in Cascade Locks, via the Bridge of the Gods, [...] and [...] west of The Dalles, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|When Chief Stewart later {{arrived at}} the Coacci home, Coacci was missing but they found Buda. When he was questioned, Buda said that Coacci owned a [...]32 Savage {{automatic}} pistol, which he kept in the kitchen. A search of the kitchen did not locate the gun, but Stewart found a manufacturer's technical diagram for a Model 1907 [...]32 Savage automatic pistol – the exact pistol type and caliber used to shoot Parmenter and Berardelli – in a kitchen drawer. Stewart asked Buda if he owned a gun, and the man produced a [...]32-caliber Spanish-made automatic pistol. Buda told police that he owned a 1914 Overland automobile, which was being repaired. The car was delivered for repairs {{four days after the}} Braintree crimes, but it was old and apparently had not been run for five months. <b>Tire</b> <b>tracks</b> were seen near the abandoned Buick getaway car, and Chief Stewart surmised that two cars had been used in the getaway, and that Buda's car might have been the second car. The garage proprietor who was repairing Buda's vehicle was instructed to call the police if anyone came to pick up the car.|$|E

2500|$|... 1998 saw Earnhardt finally win the Daytona 500 in his 20th attempt {{after being}} shut {{out in his}} {{previous}} 19 attempts. He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before {{was the first to}} drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 times. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that Jeff Gordon had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead and thanks to a push by teammate Mike Skinner, he maintained it. Earnhardt made it to the caution-checkered flag before Bobby Labonte. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined pit road to shake his hand {{as he made his way}} to victory lane. Earnhardt then drove his No. 3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving <b>tire</b> <b>tracks</b> in the shape of a No. 3 in the grass. He then spoke about the victory, saying, [...] "I have had a lot of great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can't thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it, we won it, we won it!" [...] The rest of the season did not go as well, and the 500 was his only victory that year. Despite that, he did almost pull off a Daytona sweep, where he was one of the contenders for the win in the first nighttime Pepsi 400, but a pit stop late in the race in which he caught a rogue tire like a hockey puck cost him the race win. He slipped to 12th in the point standings halfway through the season, and Richard Childress decided to make a crew chief change, taking Mike Skinner's crew chief Kevin Hamlin and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner Larry McReynolds (Earnhardt's crew chief). Earnhardt finished eighth in the final standings.|$|E
