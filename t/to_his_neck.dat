But after gaining the Second Level with the Sound Four's aid, Sasuke began training under Orochimaru and manages to isolate the level two transformation to specific parts of his body within a few years' time before Itachi removed the Cursed Seal from him. Anko also had hers removed during the Fourth Great Ninja War when Sasuke transferred the consciousness within it into a new body.|$|E

5|$|De Haro {{realized}} that an invasion was inevitable and ordered Captain Juan de Amezquita and 300 men {{to defend the}} island from El Morro Castle and then had the city of San Juan evacuated. He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance {{in the interior of}} the island. On September 25, Enrico attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and La Fortaleza (the Governor's Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> which he received from the hands of Amezquita. The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans, who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amezquita and Andre Botello decided {{to put a stop to}} the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in haste to reach their ships. Enrico upon his retreat left behind him one of his largest ships, stranded, and over 400 dead. He then tried to invade the island by attacking the town of Aguada. He was again defeated by the local militia and abandoned the idea of invading Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, {{only a few}} {{survived the}} defeat. The most notable person to be killed, however, was Emperor Nicephorus, who {{according}} to historians died on a dunghill {{on the day of}} the battle. Nicephorus's son, Stauracius, was carried to safety by the Imperial bodyguard after receiving a paralyzing wound <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Six months later, his wounds finally killed him. According to tradition, Krum had the Emperor's head on a spike, then lined his skull with silver and used it as a drinking cup.|$|E

Benoit got two title matches the following week, first losing {{in a manner similar}} to the Montreal Screwjob in Calgary and then losing in a close match in Benoit's hometown of Edmonton. However, Benoit suffered a neck injury in a four-way TLC match that required surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood. Despite this, he continued to wrestle until the King of the Ring, where he was pinned in a triple threat match versus Austin and Jericho. Benoit missed the next year due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> injury, missing the entire Invasion storyline.|$|E

25|$|However, {{as police}} {{obtained}} confessions from suspects, bodies {{continued to be}} discovered, proving that the suspects who had confessed could not be the killer the police were seeking. On 30 October 1983 the eviscerated body of a 19-year-old prostitute, named Vera Shevkun, was found in Shakhty. Shevkun had been killed on 27 October. Although the mutilations inflicted upon Shevkun's body were otherwise characteristic of those found upon other victims linked to the unknown murderer, the victim's eyes had not been enucleated or otherwise wounded. Two months later, on 27 December, a 14-year-old Gukovo schoolboy, named Sergey Markov, was lured off a train and murdered at a rural station near Novocherkassk. Markov was emasculated and suffered over 70 knife wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and upper torso before being eviscerated.|$|E
25|$|In the {{all-around}} competition, Tomita was in medal contention until on {{his third}} event, still rings, an accident caused him to crash on the mat from the rings. Tomita was shown to be in pain after his fall and was later observed to be applying an ice pack <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Apparently, the accident caused Tomita to injure his neck, shoulder and lower back. Tomita however continued with the competition and performed well {{in the last three}} events lined up. In the end, French gymnast Benoît Caranobe edged out Tomita for an all-around bronze by 0.175. Tomita finished 4th. In an interview, Tomita said that did not give up until the end as he had been given the opportunity to compete in the event by taking the place of teammate Koki Sakamoto, who had a better score than he did in the qualifying.|$|E
25|$|Lundqvist's {{performance}} in the 2014–15 season was also stellar. However, in a game on January 31, 2015 against the Carolina Hurricanes, Lundqvist took a shot <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> from Brad Malone. He stayed in net for the game, which the Rangers won 4-2, and went in net for another game on February 2, a 6-3 win over the Florida Panthers, before {{it was discovered that}} a blood vessel in Lundqvist's neck was damaged, and that Lundqvist would be out for 5–7 weeks as a result. Despite the superior performance of backup goaltender Cam Talbot during Lundqvist's absence, Lundqvist would remain the Rangers' starter upon his return on March 28, in a 4-2 loss to the Boston Bruins. Despite missing nearly 2 months, Lundqvist was able to clinch 30 wins for the 9th time in his career, going 5-2-0 after returning from the injury.|$|E

25|$|Injuries {{affected}} {{the selection of}} the two sides for the final Test. Mike Hendrick was still suffering from his hamstring, Bob Willis from his troubled knees, so Peter Lever was brought in for Willis and Chris Old's good form was finally rewarded with a Test place instead of the veteran Fred Titmus. David Lloyd had an old football injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> flare up and Colin Cowdrey took his place as makeshift opener. John Edrich had now recovered from his broken ribs and was recalled to the team in place rather than the out of form Brian Luckhurst. Jeff Thomson was out with his tennis shoulder and Australia brought in Geoff Dymock, a fast-medium left-arm bowler who had taken a wicket with his second ball the previous year at Adelaide. After top-scoring at Sydney the leg-spinner Terry Jenner was dropped for the return of batsman Ross Edwards. Despite the hot weather a thunderstorm wetted the covers before the match and the groundsmen spilled water on the wicket when removing them in the morning, which would drastically affect play. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fifth time in the series and chosen to bat, probably as he underestimated the amount of water on the wicket which was otherwise excellent for batting.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} witness to attacks from the English led by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 (in {{what is known}} as the Battle of Puerto Rico) and by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, in 1598. Artillery from San Juan's fort, El Morro, {{repelled}} Drake; however, Clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city. After a few months of English occupation, Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness. In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces led by Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Amezquita and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> which he received from the hands of Amezquita. The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion.

500|$|Norse sources {{describe}} a large force emerging from hiding places in an ambush. The Norwegian forces {{were taken by}} surprise, and were not in battle order. Magnus attempted to assert control over his disordered army, ordering part of his force to seize secure ground and use archery fire to slow the Irish. In the melee Magnus was pierced by a spear through both thighs above the knees but he fought on, attempting to get his men back to the level campsite.

500|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{commencement}} of the World Heavyweight Championship Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker {{was involved in a}} pyrotechnics accident during his ring entrance.

He suffered first- and second-degree burns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and chest, and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury [...] "looked like a bad sunburn". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort. Chris Jericho, who also competed in the match, has told on multiple occasions how the pyrotechnician responsible was relieved of his employment with WWE and escorted from the arena at the behest of The Undertaker.|$|E

500|$|The body suits worn by Khan and Rampal were {{designed}} by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery, and made {{by a team of}} specialists based in Los Angeles.

To create the suit, Khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex-like liquid was released up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and allowed to solidify, forming the mould which was then peeled off his body. The suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified. Computer-generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film.
