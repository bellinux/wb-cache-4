5|$|<b>The</b> <b>religion</b> {{was born}} in Iran, where it has faced ongoing {{persecution}} since its inception. It grew from the mid-19th century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send a prophet {{in the manner of}} Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in the Ottoman province of Syria, in what is now Israel. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of <b>the</b> <b>religion,</b> and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in Haifa, Israel near the shrine of Báb.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the sharpest}} and most {{constant}} criticisms which Paul Althaus leveled against Karl Barth's {{views of the}} non-Christian world was that of Christomonism. Althaus felt that the basic lack and the abiding sin in Barth's evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> was his narrow, restrictive, exclusive understanding {{of the reality of}} Christ, which bans all extra-Christian reality into the realm of meaninglessness and godlessness. Althaus, indeed, was not alone in such accusations. He voiced an objection which, he felt, every Christian theologian must make: because Barth's vision of Christ was too narrow, too "monistic", because he set undue limitations on Christ — he missed the breadth of God's plan of salvation and the religions' role in this plan. Barth's understanding of <b>religion</b> and <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> is christomonistic — and therefore to be rejected. Is such a diagnosis correct? Unfortunately, Althaus, like many of Barth's critics, never spelled out in detail just how Christomonism vitiated his views of <b>the</b> <b>religions.</b> Others, therefore, warn of oversimplifying or misinterpreting Barth's sweeping, harshly condemnatory statements on <b>the</b> <b>religions.</b> <b>The</b> "Theologischer Konvent Augsburgischen Bekenntnisses" in 1963 cautioned against making a "Popanz" of Barth's description of <b>religions</b> in <b>the</b> Kirchliche Dogmatik. And more recently C. S. Song in a doctoral dissertation for Union Theological Seminary sweepingly affirms that those who criticize Barth's doctrine on <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> for its narrowness, have misread its deeper content: Barth's last word on <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> is positive! Finally it must be remembered that Barth's "cruelty" towards <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> was also aimed at Christianity. Can his final verdict therefore be totally negative or the product of Christomonism? It is {{the purpose of this article}} to carry out and, in a sense, to test Althaus' diagnosis. We will examine Barth's most direct and succinct treatment of <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> — Paragraph 17 of his Kirchliche Dogmatik (to be referred to as KD 17) — for the presence of Christomonism. To do this properly, our analysis of KD 17 will be made in the light of Barth's early encounter with <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> in his Römerbrief (second edition — referred to as RB). Such a study will indicate that Althaus' diagnosis, though simply and somewhat rashly stated, seems to be valid: Christomonism does form the deepest roots of Barth's evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>religions.</b> It was also the factor which marked the development of Barth's thinking on <b>the</b> <b>religions</b> from RB to KD 17 and which made his final verdict all the more negative and harsh...|$|R
