5|$|For {{its opening}} game, Florida State faced the lightly {{regarded}} Samford Bulldogs and defeated them 59–6. In its second game, No.17 Florida State faced a tougher challenge as it traveled to Norman, Oklahoma {{to play the}} No.10-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. The Seminoles were defeated 47–17, in their third-worst loss since 1991. Florida State rebounded from the loss to defeat Brigham Young University, 34–10, <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> ACC season by defeating Wake Forest, Virginia, in-state rival Miami and Boston College in succession.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{excellent}} {{performances in}} leading Juventus {{to win the}} Serie A title, Italy coach Cesare Prandelli included the playmaker in his 32-man provisional squad for Euro 2012, and subsequently in Italy's final 23-man squad for the tournament. Pirlo provided the cutting ball from which Antonio Di Natale scored the opening goal of Italy's 1–1 draw with World and European champions Spain in the opening round of group play on 10 June 2012. Pirlo <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring himself from a direct free-kick in Italy's second group match against Croatia on 14 June, which also ended in a 1–1 draw; Pirlo was named Man of the Match. In the final group match against Ireland, Pirlo set up Antonio Cassano's goal from a corner kick to help Italy take a 1–0 lead. Italy eventually won 2–0 and progressed to the knock-out stage of the tournament as runners-up in Group C.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> bowling and castled home captain Les Berry {{for one to}} leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, some {{residents}} of Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood informed rebel leaders {{that they could}} use a sewer tunnel that ran from the Dung Gate to a mill in the Jewish Quarter, to clandestinely enter Jerusalem. The next day, 36 rebels (peasants and Jerusalemites) {{under the leadership of}} Sheikh Subh Shawkah, chief of the Bethlehem-area Fawaghirah tribe, entered the city via the tunnel and <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Dung Gate to allow thousands of rebels inside the walled city. The Egyptian commander of the city, Rashad Bey, subsequently withdrew his garrison into Jerusalem's citadel to take up positions against the incoming rebels.|$|E
5|$|In Norfolk, {{the revolt}} {{was led by}} Geoffrey Litster, a weaver, and Sir Roger Bacon, a local lord with ties to the Suffolk rebels. Litster began sending out {{messengers}} across the county in a call to arms on 14 June, and isolated outbreaks of violence occurred. The rebels assembled on 17 June outside Norwich and killed Sir Robert Salle, {{who was in charge}} of the city defences and had attempted to negotiate a settlement. The people of the town <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> gates to let the rebels in. They began looting buildings and killed Reginald Eccles, a local official. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk fled his estates and travelled in disguise to London. The other leading members of the local gentry were captured and forced to play out the roles of a royal household, working for Litster. Violence spread out across the county, as gaols were opened, Flemish immigrants killed, court records burned, and property looted and destroyed.|$|E

5|$|On Thursday, 5 September, the Australians {{arrived at}} Clifton for what {{promised to be}} an {{explosive}} encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire soundly by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7–49 and 5–41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1–90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who really did have a score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It {{was the first time}} Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.|$|E
5|$|The Gliders {{planned to}} {{dominate}} Mexico early, playing as aggressively against {{them as they}} had played against the Netherlands. Australia's first shots at goal were taken by Kean from the free-throw line, but she missed both. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, {{which turned out to}} be their biggest of the game. Gauci then put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Gauci, which was repeated on the next play, with Stewart providing the assist this time. Mexico scored, but the Gliders responded with another shot from Crispin. On the next play, Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Nott then took a defensive rebound, leading to Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled, but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Stewart drew another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14–4.|$|E
5|$|Having {{retired from}} top-tier football, Loxton soon broke into {{first-class}} cricket. He {{was selected for}} Victoria to make his debut in the match against Queensland in December 1946 because five players, including Miller, were playing in a Test match for Australia against England during their Test tour. The debutant scored 232 not out, sharing a Victorian record sixth-wicket partnership of 289 with Doug Ring, who made 145. When he had scored 183, Loxton hit himself {{on the head with}} his bat in attempting a hook shot, but continued batting until the end of Victoria’s innings and <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> bowling in Queensland’s innings. He took the first wicket before going off to hospital with concussion. Recovering in time to bowl in the second innings, he took 2 wickets for 40 runs (2/40) in an innings win. Loxton's 232 not out remains a record debut score in Australian first-class cricket. His debut performance was enough for him to keep his place when the Test players returned, and he scored 73 and took a total of 3/17 in the next match against arch-rivals New South Wales, which Victoria won by an innings. He compiled 87 in the next match against Queensland, and Victoria won {{all but one of the}} five Sheffield Shield matches in which he played—the only draw was washed out—to claim the title. The all-rounder finished the season atop Victoria's batting averages, with 429 runs at a batting average of 143.00. He also headed the bowling averages with 8 wickets at 14.00 runs apiece.|$|E

5|$|To this end, he {{contacted}} Abu'l-Aswar and called upon him {{to attack the}} Armenians from the rear. Abu'l-Aswar agreed, in exchange for guarantees that he would retain his conquests, a request granted in an imperial chrysobull. Faced with a two-pronged assault, Gagik was forced to visit Constantinople. There he was kept hostage and Ani was surrendered to the Byzantines in 1045. Notwithstanding his previous promises, immediately after taking possession of Ani, the emperor requested that Abu'l-Aswar vacate the fortresses he had conquered. When the latter refused, a large army under Michael Iasites and the magistros Constantine the Alan, containing numerous Armenians, marched against Dvin. Abu'l-Aswar let them approach, and <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> irrigation canals and flooded the plain around the city. Stuck in the mud, the besiegers were easy prey for the Shaddadid archers, who inflicted huge casualties on the Byzantine force. Constantine IX responded by placing Katakalon Kekaumenos and the parakoimomenos Constantine in charge of Armenia. Instead of attacking Dvin, however, the new Byzantine leadership concentrated its efforts on recovering the forts captured by Abu'l-Aswar. Surmari, Anberd, and Khor Virap fell to the Byzantine army, but Chelidonion (modern Yerevan) resisted until September 1047, when the outbreak of a rebellion led by Leo Tornikios forced the army's recall to Constantinople. A peace treaty was hastily concluded, whereby Abu'l-Aswar agreed not to raid Byzantine territory and to recognize {{the authority of the}} emperor.|$|E

Miller then missed the innings victory against Minor Counties, instead spending the weekend with Princess Margaret.|$|E

On 17 May 1989 old Glamorgan players formed Glamorgan 1969 to face the current team, Glamorgan 1989 in a 30 over day/night match. Davis took three wickets for 44 runs off of four overs, those of Michael Cann, John Derrick and the century maker Matthew Maynard. Davis <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> batting for Glamorgan 1969 with Alan Jones, scoring three before being bowled by Steve Watkin.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} professions open {{to college}} graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau, so in 1835 {{he took a}} leave of absence from Harvard, during which he taught school in Canton, Massachusetts. After he graduated in 1837, he joined the faculty of the Concord public school, but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment. He and his brother John <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Concord Academy, a grammar school in Concord, in 1838. They introduced several progressive concepts, including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses. The school closed when John became fatally ill from tetanus in 1842 after cutting himself while shaving. He died in Henry's arms.|$|E
25|$|By that time, Jayakatwang, the Adipati (Duke) of Kediri, a {{vassal state}} of Singhasari, had usurped and killed Kertanagara. After being pardoned by Jayakatwang {{with the aid}} of Madura's regent, Arya Wiraraja; Raden Wijaya, Kertanegara's son-in-law, was given the land of Tarik timberland. He <b>then</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> vast timberland and built a new {{settlement}} there. The village was named Majapahit, which was taken from the name of a fruit that had a bitter taste (maja is the fruit name and pahit means bitter). When the Mongolian Yuan army sent by Kublai Khan arrived, Wijaya allied himself with the army to fight against Jayakatwang. Once Jayakatwang was destroyed, Raden Wijaya forced his allies to withdraw from Java by launching a surprise attack. Yuan's army had to withdraw in confusion as they were in hostile territory. It was also their last chance to catch the monsoon winds home; otherwise, {{they would have had to}} wait for another six months.|$|E
