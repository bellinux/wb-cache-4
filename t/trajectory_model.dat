40|$|Abstract We {{have shown}} that the HMM whose state output vector {{includes}} static and dynamic feature parame-ters can be reformulated as a <b>trajectory</b> <b>model</b> by imposing the explicit relationship between the static and dynamic features. The derived model, referred to as “trajectory HMM, ” can alleviate the limitations of HMMs: i) constant statistics within an HMM state and ii) independence assumption of state output probabilities. In this paper, we first summarize the definition and the training algorithm. Then, to show that the trajectory HMM is a proper generative model, we derive a new algorithm for sampling from the <b>trajectory</b> <b>model,</b> and show the result of an illustrative experiment.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that hidden Markov models (HMMs) can only exploit the time-dependence in the speech process in a limited way.

Speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition experiments showed that the proposed method is effective for speech recognition. 1...|$|R

To date, {{the neural}} {{decoding}} of time-evolving physical state – for example, {{the path of}} a foraging rat or arm movements – has been largely carried out using linear <b>trajectory</b> <b>models,</b> primarily due to their computational efficiency. The possibility of better capturing the statistics of the movements using nonlinear <b>trajectory</b> <b>models,</b> thereby yielding more accurate decoded trajectories, is enticing. However, nonlinear decoding usually carries a higher computational cost, which is an important consideration in real-time settings. In this paper, we present techniques for nonlinear decoding employing modal Gaussian approximations, expectatation propagation, and Gaussian quadrature. We compare their decoding accuracy versus computation time tradeoffs based on high-dimensional simulated neural spike counts.
