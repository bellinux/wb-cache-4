5|$|Newsweek {{verbally}} accepted Hensmann's {{offer and}} he in turn informed Murdoch, {{giving him the}} option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements {{and came to a}} second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.|$|E

His writings show that with the exception of his bravado, he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared.

25|$|De Valera’s {{preoccupation with}} {{his part in}} history, and his need to explain and justify it, are {{reflected}} in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify {{what he saw as}} the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.|$|E

500|$|Summing up Captain Scarlet as [...] "better puppets, bigger {{action and}} a huge step {{backwards}} in stories" [...] compared to Thunderbirds, Peel disputes {{the claim that the}} next generation of puppets mark a failure {{on the part of the}} series, arguing that the increased realism could not have deterred an audience familiar with the previous design. Although <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> the characterisation was less endearing, Peel suggests that it is an over-emphasis on the visual, at the expense of characterisation, that truly accounts for the reduced credibility of Captain Scarlet.|$|E
500|$|Author Yoshihiro Togashi {{stated that}} he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho {{during a period of}} time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and {{illustrate}} a manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, {{he did not have a}} clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title [...] "How to be a Ghost" [...] while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed [...] "YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)" [...] for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: [...] "YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)". He commented that he could have used [...] "Den (Legend)" [...] or [...] "Monogatari (Story)", but [...] "Hakusho (Report)" [...] was the first thing that came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. [...] "Yusuke Urameshi" [...] is a pun, [...] "Kazuma Kuwabara" [...] is a combination of two professional baseball players, and [...] "Hiei" [...] and [...] "Kurama" [...] are [...] "just names that popped into [...] head". When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.|$|E
500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He {{is the one who}} hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> tricks, it is difficult to tell for sure if he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the whole place collapses - which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E

2500|$|Later in life Suzuki {{was more}} {{inclined}} to Jodo Shin (True Pure Land) practice on a personal level, seeing in the doctrine of Tariki, or other power as opposed to self power, an abandonment of self that is entirely complementary to Zen practice and yet <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> even less willful than traditional Zen. In his book Buddha of Infinite Light (2002), (originally titled, Shin Buddhism) Suzuki declared that, [...] "Of all the developments that Mahayana Buddhism has achieved in East Asia, the most remarkable one is the Shin teaching of Pure Land Buddhism."

It {{was the first}} project to credit Wings as the artist. The band name {{is said to have}} come to McCartney as he was praying in the hospital while Linda was giving birth to their second child together, Stella, on 13 September 1971. Paul McCartney recalled in the film Wingspan that the birth of Stella was [...] "a bit of a drama"; there were complications at the birth and that both Linda and the baby almost died. He was praying fervently and the image of wings came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He decided to name his new band [...] "Wings".|$|E
2500|$|Without having {{much in the}} way of {{sustenance}} or {{good news}} to offer the British people, he took a risk in deliberately choosing to emphasise the dangers instead. [...] "Rhetorical power", wrote Churchill, [...] "is neither wholly bestowed, nor wholly acquired, but cultivated." [...] Not all were impressed by his oratory. Robert Menzies, Australian Prime Minister, said of Churchill during the Second World War: [...] "His real tyrant is the glittering phrase so attractive <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> that awkward facts have to give way." [...] Another associate wrote: [...] "He is... the slave of the words which his mind forms about ideas... And he can convince himself of almost every truth if it is once allowed thus to start on its wild career through his rhetorical machinery." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{arriving}} in Paris after the war, de Hory {{attempted to make}} an honest living as an artist, but soon discovered {{that he had an}} uncanny ability to copy the styles of noted painters. In 1946, he sold a pen and ink drawing to a British woman who mistook it for an original work by Picasso. His financial desperation trumped his scruples, as was most often the case for the next two decades. <b>To</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> it offered redemption from the starving artist scenario, buttressed by the comfortable rationalization that his buyers were getting something beautiful at [...] "friendly" [...] prices. He began to sell his Picasso pastiches to art galleries around Paris, claiming that he was a displaced Hungarian aristocrat and his offerings were what remained from his family's art collection, or that he had acquired them directly from the artist whom he had known during his years in Paris.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the age of}} 16 until 32, Nichiren, {{originally}} a monk of [...] Tendai Buddhism, studied in numerous temples in Japan, especially Mt. Hiei (Enryaku-ji) and Mt. Kōya, in his day the major centers of Buddhist study, in the KyotoNara area. He eventually concluded that the highest teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha (563?–483?BC) were {{to be found in}} the Lotus Sutra. The mantra he expounded on 28 April 1253, known as the Daimoku or Odaimoku, Namu-Myōhō-Renge-Kyō, expresses his devotion to that body of teachings. During his lifetime, Nichiren stridently maintained that the contemporary teachings of Buddhism taught by other sects, (particularly the Nembutsu, Zen, Shingon, and Ritsu sects) were, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> mistaken in their interpretations of the correct path to enlightenment, and therefore refuted them publicly and vociferously. In doing so, he provoked the ire of the country's rulers and of the priests of the sects he criticized; he was subjected to persecution which included an attempted beheading and at least two exiles.|$|E
2500|$|The Padres {{selected}} Gwynn in {{the third}} round of the 1981 MLB draft with the 58th overall pick. He had gone to Padres games while he was at San Diego State, and would sit there thinking that they had the [...] "ugliest uniforms I've ever seen in my life". Those uniforms again came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> after he was drafted. McKeon had wanted to take Gwynn with the Padres' first pick, but they chose two other players in the first round and another in the second. McKeon threatened to walk out of the draft room had San Diego not selected him {{in the third}}. Later that day, Gwynn was also selected by the San Diego Clippers in the 10th round of the NBA draft. According to then-Clippers general manager Ted Podleski, Gwynn might have gone as high as the sixth round if he was not a baseball player. Gwynn chose to play baseball with the Padres in what he termed a [...] "practical" [...] decision, citing his physical battles pushing and fighting against larger players such as Charles Bradley while playing WAC basketball.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} in Germany, {{but he and his}} family fled to the United States before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, where he changed his name and later served the American war effort. Afterwards, he pursued work in electronics. He was asked to build [...] "the best television set in the world" [...] in 1951 while working at Loral. He proposed the idea of playing games on television screens, but his boss rejected it. That idea came back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> in 1966 while working at Sanders Associates, and he went on to develop eight hardware prototypes. The last two were the Brown Box and its de/dt extension, which became the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. He also contributed to the development of other consoles and consumer game units. In February, 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology for [...] "his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms".|$|E

And as he grew into years, and his reason became weaker by length of time, it was not sufficient to recall <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> the institutions of his own country; so he still more and more condemned his own God, and continued to regard the gods that his marriages had introduced nay, before this happened, he sinned, and fell into an error about the observation of the laws, when he made the images of brazen oxen that supported the brazen sea, and the images of lions about his own throne; for these he made, although it was not agreeable to piety so to do; and this he did, notwithstanding that he had his father as a most excellent and domestic pattern of virtue, and knew what a glorious character he had left behind him, because of his piety towards God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1973, Yes {{were on the}} Japanese leg {{of their}} 1972–73 world tour to promote their fifth studio album, Close to the Edge (1972). By this time, the band's line-up had stabilised around singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White, who had {{replaced}} original drummer Bill Bruford the year before. During their stop in Tokyo, Anderson was {{in his hotel room}} seeking a theme for the next Yes album. One of his ideas involved a [...] "large-scale composition", which came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> when he found himself [...] "caught up in a lengthy footnote on page 83" [...] of Autobiography of a Yogi (1946), the autobiography of Indian yogi and guru Paramahansa Yogananda. This footnote described four bodies of Hindu text, collectively named the shastras, that Yogananda described as [...] "comprehensive treatises" [...] that cover [...] "every aspect of religious and social life, and the fields of law, medicine, architecture, art, etc." [...] that [...] "convey profound truths under a veil of detailed symbolism". Anderson soon [...] "became engrossed" [...] {{with the idea of a}} [...] "four-part epic" [...] album based on the four shastras, though he later admitted that he did not fully understand what the scriptures were about. He was introduced to Yogananda's book by Jamie Muir, then the percussionist for King Crimson, at Bruford's wedding reception on 2 March 1973. Anderson spoke about his meeting with Muir: [...] "I felt I had to learn from him. We started talking about meditation in music—not the guru type but some really heavy stuff." [...] During the album's production, Anderson talked to Vera Stanley Alder, a painter and author of several books on spirituality that had a profound influence on Anderson, for clarifications on his interpretations of the scriptures.|$|E
