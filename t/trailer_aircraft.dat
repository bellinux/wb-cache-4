50|$|Vehicles and <b>trailers</b> shipped on <b>aircraft</b> had a {{vertical}} yellow 6 inch line, ¾ inch wide, showing {{the centre of}} gravity, ½ inch wide on motorbikes.|$|R
40|$|Study {{has been}} made to assure maximum utility of storage space and crew member {{facilities}} in planned space shuttle orbiter. Techniques discussed in this study should be of interest to designers of storage facilities in which space is at premium and vibration is severe. Manufacturers of boats, campers, house <b>trailers,</b> and <b>aircraft</b> could benefit from it...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} predominantly from foam, aluminum and wood with no aircraft fabric used in finishing. Each 12 ft wing uses a deep spar, foam ribs and {{is covered in}} a single pre-painted white aluminum panel. The controls are conventional three-axis, with full-span ailerons and an all-flying rudder. The wings are not folding, but can be removed in five minutes to allow <b>trailering</b> the <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M819, with {{an extra}} long wheelbase, was a wrecker with a fifth wheel mounted behind the boom. This let the truck load and tow semi <b>trailers.</b> Meant for <b>aircraft</b> recovery, they had a smaller body and less {{equipment}} than the M816.|$|R
50|$|The Mylius Family of Aircraft {{was derived}} from the barn-built MHK-101 design, which later was adopted by MBB and became the Boelkow Bo-209 Monsun project. The Bo-209 was a full metal, low wing basic trainer with {{standard}} aerobatic capabilities (+6/-3.5 g), 150 hp O-320 or 160 hp IO-320 engine. The front wheel was retractable (fixed as an option). Both wings were foldable, thus permitting to <b>trailer</b> the <b>aircraft</b> by a car on its own main wheels, nose wheel retracted and tail forward.|$|R
50|$|Animal {{transporters}} {{are used}} to transport livestock or non-livestock animals over long distances. They could be specially-modified vehicles, <b>trailers,</b> ships or <b>aircraft</b> containers. While some animal transporters like horse trailers only carry a few animals, modern ships engaged in live export can carry tens of thousands.|$|R
50|$|After 33 {{years of}} {{manufacturing}} <b>aircraft</b> and <b>trailers,</b> the Spartan <b>Aircraft</b> Company closed its manufacturing facilities {{and entered the}} insurance and financial business under the name Minnehoma Insurance Co. The Spartan name was sold to the Spartan School of Aeronautics, which operates today under the name Spartan College of Aeronautics.|$|R
25|$|In {{the video}} game Tom Clancy's EndWar, the Place de la Concorde is across the bridge from the spawn point and is a major firefight zone. The zone is also showcased in the trailer, Russians use the square for cover and the Luxor Obelisk is heavily damaged. Later in the <b>trailer</b> a {{transport}} <b>aircraft</b> crashes {{in the center of}} the square. In the end a missile lands in the background and destroys the square.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} an all-fabric inflatable aircraft was based on Taylor McDaniel inflatable rubber glider experiments in 1931. Designed and built in only 12 weeks, the Goodyear Inflatoplane was built in 1956, {{with the idea that}} it could be used by the military as a rescue plane to be dropped in a hardened container behind enemy lines. The 44 cubic ft (1.25 cubic meter) container could also be transported by truck, jeep <b>trailer</b> or <b>aircraft.</b> The inflatable surface of this aircraft was actually a sandwich of two rubber-type materials connected by a mesh of nylon threads, forming an I-beam. When the nylon was exposed to air, it absorbed and repelled water as it stiffened, giving the aircraft its shape and rigidity. Structural integrity was retained in flight with forced air being continually circulated by the aircraft's motor.|$|R
50|$|Vehicle tax is levied {{annually}} on owners of motor vehicles and <b>trailers,</b> ships, and <b>aircraft.</b> Commercial ships and aircraft operated by transportation companies, agricultural, military vehicles and ambulances are exempt. The Code establishes maximum rates tied to engine power. Rates increase steeply with increasing horsepower. For example, in 2009 fiscal year {{the city of}} Moscow levies 700 roubles on a 100 h.p. passenger car, 2400 roubles on 120 h.p., 12,000 roubles on 200 h.p. and 45,000 roubles on 300 h.p. Taxation {{does not depend on}} emission levels.|$|R
50|$|Spartan Aircraft Company reorganized after World War II, {{renaming}} {{itself as}} Spartan Aero Repair in 1946. It ceased to produce aircraft, though {{it continued to}} operate the school. For the next 15 years the parent company made Spartan <b>Trailers</b> instead of <b>aircraft.</b> It closed the Tulsa manufacturing plant in 1961, and renamed Minnehoma Insurance Company. The Spartan tradename was sold to the Spartan school. In 1967, the former Spartan interests were bought by Automation Industries, Inc., which sold them to National Education Corporation parent company of National Education Center, Inc. in 1972.|$|R
