5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide <b>Th(OH)4</b> forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Thorium hydroxide, <b>Th(OH)4,</b> can be {{prepared}} by adding a hydroxide of ammonium or an alkali metal to a thorium salt solution, where it appears as a gelatinous precipitate that will dissolve in dilute acids, among other substances. It can also {{be prepared}} by electrolysis of thorium nitrates. It is stable from 260–450°C; at 470°C and above it continuously decomposes to become thoria. It easily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the hydrated carbonate ThOCO3·xH2O and, under high-pressure conditions in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, Th(CO3)2·0.5H2O or Th(OH)2CO3·2H2O. Several mixed oxides are known, such as BaThO3, which has the perovskite structure.|$|E
500|$|In another {{extraction}} method, monazite is decomposed with a 45% {{aqueous solution}} of sodium hydroxide at 140°C. Mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first, filtered at 80°C, washed {{with water and}} dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Next, the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to pH = 5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide (<b>Th(OH)4)</b> contaminated with ~3% of rare-earth hydroxides; the rest of rare-earth hydroxides remains in solution. Thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements. An efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid, because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents: ...|$|E
50|$|Eigencolloid {{is a term}} {{derived from}} the German {{language}} (eigen: own) and used to designate colloids made of pure phases. Most often such colloids are formed by the hydrolysis of heavy metals cations or radionuclides, such as, e.g., Tc(OH)4, <b>Th(OH)4,</b> U(OH)4, Pu(OH)4, or Am(OH)3. Colloids have been suspected for the long-range transport of plutonium on the Nevada Test Site.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{types of}} colloids are recognised: {{inorganic}} colloids (clay particles, silicates, iron oxy-hydroxides, ...), organic colloids (humic and fulvic substances). When heavy metals or radionuclides {{form their own}} pure colloids, the term [...] "Eigencolloid" [...] is used to designate pure phases, e.g., Tc(OH)4, <b>Th(OH)4,</b> U(OH)4, Am(OH)3. Colloids have been suspected for the long range transport of plutonium on the Nevada Nuclear Test Site. They {{have been the subject}} of detailed studies for many years. However, the mobility of inorganic colloids is very low in compacted bentonites and in deep clay formations ...|$|E
