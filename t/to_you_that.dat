25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails.

500|$|In April 2011, Katy {{released}} her debut album, entitled On a Mission, by Rinse and Columbia Records. Exploring dubstep-based musical genres, it garnered critical praise, including being {{nominated for the}} Mercury Prize. In the UK, it was a commercial success, peaking at number 2 in the UK. Following that release, was the extended play (EP) Danger, which was available online in December 2012. During an interview with Billboard held in March 2013, Katy revealed that her sophomore studio album was nearly done. Katy revealed to MTV UK website District MTV that she felt inspired to record [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] by hearing dance music.

500|$|On September 11, 1841 {{after the}} second bank veto, members of the cabinet entered Tyler's office {{one by one and}} resigned—an {{orchestration}} by Clay to force Tyler's resignation and place his own lieutenant, Senate President pro tempore Samuel L. Southard, in the White House. The only exception was Webster, who remained to finalize what became the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty, and to demonstrate his independence from Clay. When told by Webster {{that he was willing to}} stay, Tyler is reported to have said, [...] "Give me your hand on that, and now I will say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Henry Clay is a doomed man." [...] On September 13, when the president did not resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party. Tyler was lambasted by Whig newspapers and received hundreds of letters threatening his assassination. Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds to fix the White House, which had fallen into disrepair.|$|E
500|$|The $210 million LIRR plan faced great criticism, and one {{particular}} section received heavy opposition. New York State Senator John J.

Santucci said that the link's construction would irreversibly destroy part of the park, destroying a community landmark and [...] "stripping away {{the resources of the}} people for the luxury of the few." [...] In October 1974, the president of the Hammel Holland Seaside Civic Association wrote to Mayor Abraham Beame, [...] "It is our earnest plea <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your decision on this rape of Forest Park be rescinded." [...] The association's president further said that although it would be cost-ineffective to create a premium service to JFK Airport, the Rockaway Beach Branch should still be reactivated for local passengers.|$|E

500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have I said <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E
500|$|Champollion was {{particularly}} {{captured by the}} array of important monuments and inscriptions at Thebes, and decided {{to spend as much}} time there as possible on the way back north. South of Thebes, the Isis sprang leak and nearly sank. Having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing the boat they continued south to Aswan where the boats had to be left, since they could not make it across the first Cataract. They traveled by small boats and camelback to Elephantine and Philae. At Philae, Champollion spent several days recovering from an attack of gout brought on by the hard trip, and he also received letters from his wife and brother, both sent many months earlier. Champollion attributed their delay to Drovetti's ill will. They arrived at Abu Simbel on November 26, the site had been visited by Bankes and Belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively, but the sand that they had cleared from the entrance had now returned. On January 1, 1829, they reached Wadi Halfa and returned north. That day, Champollion composed a letter to M. Dacier stating that [...] "I am proud now, having followed the course of the Nile from its mouth to the second cataract, {{to have the right to}} announce <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there is nothing to modify in our [...] "Letter on the Alphabet of the Hieroglyphs."

500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E
