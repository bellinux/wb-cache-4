25|$|There is also {{a strong}} {{connection}} between the transpersonal and the humanistic approaches to psychology, {{as indicated by the}} sourcebook of Donald Moss. Although transpersonal psychology is considered to have started off within, or developed from humanistic psychology, many of its interests, such as spirituality and modes of consciousness, extend beyond the areas of interest discussed by humanistic theory. According to writers in the field transpersonal psychology advocates for an expanded, spiritual, view of physical and mental health <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> addressed by humanistic psychology.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} different, and often conflicting, {{hypotheses}} {{that attempt to}} explain the deficits associated with deep dyslexia.

Some models may be stronger than others, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> reflected here.

25|$|Fractals are {{different}} from other geometric figures {{because of the way}} in which they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). But if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography is a {{non-invasive}} method of quantifying cardiac output using ultrasound. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and Doppler measurements are used together to calculate cardiac output. 2D {{measurement of the}} diameter (d) of the aortic annulus allows calculation of the flow cross-sectional area (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the flow volume per beat (stroke volume, SV). The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output. Although used in clinical medicine, it has a wide test-retest variability. It is said to require extensive training and skill, but the exact steps needed to achieve clinically adequate precision have never been disclosed. 2D measurement of the aortic valve diameter is one source of noise; others are beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume and subtle differences in probe position. An alternative <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> more reproducible is the measurement of the pulmonary valve to calculate right-sided CO. Although it is in wide general use, the technique is time consuming and {{is limited by the}} reproducibility of its component elements. In the manner used in clinical practice, precision of SV and CO is of the order of ±20%.|$|E
