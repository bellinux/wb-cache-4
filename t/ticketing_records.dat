40|$|Despite their {{principal}} use {{as predictors of}} response to changing conditions, most travel demand models are estimated from data collected in single time periods. The fact of high mutual correlation between explanatory variables is perhaps the single greatest problem for the analyst, and has led to increasing use of disaggregate approaches, and a widespread recognition {{of the need for}} the 'temporal validation' of the models. Ideally, of course, such models would be estimated from data sets spanning different time periods; in practice the only historic information that is usually available is highly aggregate and incomplete. For example, the calibration of a conventional mode-splitldistribution model requires the collection of a sufficient set of zone-to-zone flows by each mode to identify the model parameters; such information will not normally exist for other time periods. However, it may happen that for previous years <b>ticketing</b> <b>records</b> and automatic traffic counts do provide information about certain specific groups of these flows. Such information is potentially useful, and may even allow a time dimension to be incorporated in the model specification. The second major use of conventional models is to Snfill' incomplete data to establish a current pattern of demand; here too estimates of aggregate quantities often exist, and could be used. In addition to such directly observed groups as flows on roads or revenue collected, there may be independent estimates of other aggregates which can also be used in the model fitting process, or in forecasts. The most familiar of these would be trip-end estimates calculated on the basis of socio-economic characteristics of households in each zone. More recently {{it has been suggested that}} the average amounts of time and money allocated to travel, so called 'travel budgets', can also be estimated directly and used to inform more detailed forecasts of travel patterns. The aims of this paper are as follows; firstly (in Section 2), it will present some recent evidence for the nature of 'travel budgets', and for the implications that the stability of these budgets has for the form of travel demand models. Secondly (in Section 3), it will outline an approach by which all of the forms of data described above may be used during the model fitting, together with a corresponding algorithm which applies to the most common form of spatial interaction model, the logit model...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{the demographics of}} ski injury in relation to age, gender, and perceived cause during a representative season to identify potential injury prevention strategies. SETTING: Blackcomb Mountain, a world class ski resort in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Data were collected from the lift <b>ticket</b> <b>records</b> and from ski patrol injury reports for one season, November to May 1991 - 2. RESULTS: There were 720, 066 skier and snowboarder day visits counted by the mountain's lift <b>ticket</b> <b>records,</b> {{with a total of}} 2, 092 injury reports (incidence 2. 91 per 1, 000 day visits). Of those with significant injuries (those requiring physician care), 1, 210 (58 %) were male. The highest injury rate was among children (age 7 - 12) and teens (age 13 - 17) with incidences of 3. 18 and 3. 34 significant injuries per 1, 000 skier days, respectively. Head and face injuries constituted 17 % and 22 % of injuries, respectively in these groups. Overall 22 % of head and face injuries were severe enough to cause loss of consciousness or clinical signs of concussion. This was the body region injured most frequently in males. For females over 7 years of age, the knee was the most common site of injury. For youths, the incidence of injuries during school organized activities was 25 % higher than during other outings. CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of school group participants suggests special education is warranted. The high incidence of head injuries, particularly among young males, needs to be addressed. In light of the high proportion of this group who already wear helmets, the role of helmets in both protection and possible causation of head injury needs objective research...|$|R

50|$|Airline {{reservation}} systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger {{reservations and}} <b>ticket</b> <b>records.</b> An airline's direct distribution works {{within their own}} reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications {{to make their own}} reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A EDIFACT format for real time interactive communication and Type B TTY for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} {{ticketing}} {{complex is}} to issue and store electronic <b>ticket</b> <b>records</b> and the {{very small number of}} paper tickets that are still issued. Miscellaneous charges order (MCO) is still a paper document; IATA has working groups defining the replacement document the electronic multipurpose document (EMD) as at 2010. The electronic ticket information is stored in a database containing the data that historically was printed on a paper ticket including items such as the ticket number, the fare and tax components of the ticket price or exchange rate information. In the past, airlines issued paper tickets; since 2008, IATA has been supporting a resolution to move to 100% electronic ticketing. So far, the industry {{has not been able to}} comply due to various technological and international limitations. The industry is at 98% electronic ticket issuance today, although electronic processing for MCOs was not available in time for the IATA mandate.|$|R
