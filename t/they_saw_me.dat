500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so they can say that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> pee." ...|$|E
500|$|While Mr. Eko {{was created}} as a more passive character, the idea changed when the {{producers}} first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: [...] "once <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up, they knew this guy wasn't {{going to be just}} a passive priest". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those three guys out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's no better way to make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> as somebody ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness. And I stand guilty on those counts." ...|$|E

60|$|I found Checco, Bartolomeo and his {{two sons}} sitting together. They jumped up when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|I:2:30 [...] ALAR. [...] Ay! and <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> [...] <b>Me</b> ride {{this morning}} in my state again; [...] The people cried 'Alarcos and Castille!' [...] The shout will dull their feasts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Professor!" [...] I replied: but {{my voice}} sounded strange and far away, and the {{children}} took not the slightest notice of our farewell. Evidently <b>they</b> neither <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> nor heard me, as, with their arms lovingly twined round each other, they marched boldly on.|$|R
60|$|I think <b>they</b> both <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> at {{the same}} moment. The effect of my {{appearance}} on them was illustrative of their respective characters. Augustus turned a deep shade of purple and fixed me with a horrified stare. The Nugget winked. Augustus halted and shuffled his feet. The Nugget strolled up and accosted me like an old friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't give me {{a chance}} to speak to him. He and Guardley {{disappeared}} in the crowd like a flash. I rather think <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> and avoided me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1977 and 1983 May {{worked at}} the Bank of England, and from 1985 to 1997 as a {{financial}} consultant and senior advisor in International Affairs at the Association for Payment Clearing Services. She married Philip May in September 1980. Her father {{died in a car}} accident in 1981 and her mother of multiple sclerosis the following year. May later stated she was [...] "sorry <b>they</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> elected as a Member of Parliament".|$|R
5000|$|TQ wrote {{every word}} on <b>They</b> Never <b>Saw</b> <b>Me</b> Coming, with the lion's {{share of the}} sparse, on-point {{production}} handled by Mike Mosley of Steady Mobbin Productions. Mosley's outstanding studio work with such artists as Tupac Shakur and E-40 speaks for itself. [...] "Mike and I really like and respect each other," [...] TQ acknowledged. [...] "He's very serious about his work, like I am. By motivating each other, we both gave my project 110 percent." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Westside" [...] was {{the lead}} single from TQ's debut album, <b>They</b> Never <b>Saw</b> <b>Me</b> Coming. The song was {{produced}} by Bay-area producers Femi Ojetunde and Mike Mosley, with TQ serving as co-producer. The song is an anthemic ode to TQ's native California. In the song's lyrics he mentions several other California musicians who influenced him, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Ice-T, Too Short and DJ Quik, {{at the end of}} [...] "Westside", TQ dedicates the song to the deceased Eazy-E and Tupac Shakur.|$|R

5000|$|Terrance Quaites {{began his}} music {{career in the}} early 1990s with the R&B group Coming of Age, who had a hit with the ballad [...] "Coming Home to Love". After two album releases, the group went their {{separate}} ways. The summer of 1998 saw TQ notch his first hit with [...] "Westside". Later that year, <b>They</b> Never <b>Saw</b> <b>Me</b> Coming was released, along with the single [...] "Bye Bye Baby", and [...] "Better Days" [...] which followed the next year.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a strange}} similarity," [...] she said softly, [...] "between your {{position}} and mine. Is there anything cheering in my prospects? I am far away from home--my father and mother wouldn't care if <b>they</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> again. People talk about my money! What {{is the use of}} money to such a lonely wretch as I am? Suppose I write to London, and ask the lawyer if I may give it all away to some deserving person? Why not to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tars Tarkas was in advance, and <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him, but <b>me</b> <b>they</b> did not see. The Thark sprang {{back to my}} {{side and}} forced me into an {{adjacent}} doorway, where {{he told me to}} remain in hiding until I could escape, making my way to Helium if possible.|$|R
60|$|The two peasants {{paused in}} their work a moment as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> glance towards them, and each, with the simple gentility of the German working man, quietly stood on his head until I had {{finished}} looking at him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> at last, {{and they}} chased me with cries, [...] And they soon had me packed into bed; [...] But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes, [...] And the stars going round in my head.|$|E

60|$|For some {{hundreds}} of yards I rode on thus recklessly, because recklessness seemed my only chance. Thrice I met bodies of Zulus, but on each occasion they scattered before me, calling out words that I could not catch. It {{was as though}} they were frightened of something <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> about <b>me.</b> Perhaps <b>they</b> thought that I was mad to ride thus among them. Indeed I must have looked mad, or perhaps there was something else. At any rate I believed that I was going to win right through them when an accident happened.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of the {{explanation}} for Warren surviving, Lomas said, [...] "The saving grace was that <b>they</b> never actually <b>saw</b> my body — all <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> was <b>me</b> getting hit by a mirror. So we're {{going to do a}} whole storyline on how Warren got out, what happened and whose body it was that they found badly burnt. It's really exciting and I think the fans are going to love it." [...] On-screen, flashback sequences were filmed to show how Warren survived the fire. Hollyoaks announced a special episode centred around Warren and how he survived the fire to be broadcast on 1 December 2010, shown to viewers in various flashbacks.|$|R

60|$|<b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> {{and began}} gesticulating and advancing. I stood {{watching}} them approach.

60|$|I {{called my}} {{servants}} and bade them follow me, and went out. I walked proudly, surrounded by my retainers, and I {{came to the}} house of Bartolomeo Moratini. He had just finished dinner, and was sitting with his sons. They rose as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

Indeed, I cannot commend my life; for I am {{conscious}} {{to myself}} of many failings therein; I know also, {{that a man}} by his conversation may soon overthrow, what by argument or persuasion he doth labour to fasten upon others for their good. Yet this I can say, I was very wary of giving them occasion, by any unseemly action, to make them averse to going on pilgrimage.[73] Yea, for this very thing, they would tell me I was too precise, and that I denied myself of things, for their sakes, in which <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> no evil. Nay, I think I may say, that if what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>me</b> did hinder them, it was my great tenderness in sinning against God, or of doing any wrong to my neighbour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Baas, I went {{to fetch}} the horses with the others, and ours had strayed. I got up a tree to look for them.

Well, they came and assegaied all the other Totties, and stood under my tree cleaning their spears and getting their breath, for one of my brothers had given them a good run. But <b>they</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> although I was nearly sick from fear on the top of them. Indeed, I was sick, but into the nest.|$|R
