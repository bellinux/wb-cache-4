5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> travelling and whether <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten minutes}} {{interval}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> again put in play, this time being kicked {{off by the}} Cliftons. The rest period had apparently stiffened the Cliftons, for the Academy making a vigorous spurt got the ball thru them, and Street, following it up well, scored a touchdown for the Academy.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E
5|$|Brett Jaekle handled all of Nevada's kicking duties. He {{made all}} five extra-point attempts. Jaekle punted eight times for 295yards and kicked off five times for 270yards. With 1:42remaining, he {{attempted}} an onside kick, but <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> recovered by Maryland's Danny Oquendo.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{starting}} {{almost at}} midfield, the offensive drive that {{began at the}} end of the third quarter failed to reach field goal range, and the Hokies were forced to punt. Boston College's offense fared no better, however, and punted after a three-and-out possession. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> downed at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line, and the Hokies began their first full offensive possession of the fourthquarter.|$|E
50|$|When {{the play}} ends, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> set for <b>the</b> next play. For {{the first three}} {{instances}} above, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> set at <b>the</b> point of its maximum forward progress. That means that if a runner is driven back {{in the process of}} a tackle OR is ruled down by lack of forward progress, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> placed as close to his opponent's goal line as he had gotten before being driven back. If he runs backwards of his own volition, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> marked where he goes down. In the case of an incomplete pass, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> placed at <b>the</b> previous line of scrimmage.|$|R

5|$|Handled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> {{formerly}} one of {{the methods}} of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|In the 77th minute, Keenor, Ferguson and Davies {{passed the}} ball among {{themselves}} before playing it wide to Thirlaway. Ferguson {{ran to the}} centre and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> crossed towards him. Ferguson leapt and headed {{the ball into the}} net to equalise for Cardiff. It looked like Cardiff were about to go ahead, however, a last minute tackle by Alfred Bower prevented Ernie Curtis from scoring, giving the Welsh team another corner. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> fired towards the goal mouth, and was shot into the goal from close range by Davies putting Cardiff ahead. The final two attacks of the game were both by Cardiff, with Russell saving a header by Ferguson and then Curtis firing the ball over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Kansas {{took over}} {{at its own}} 12-yard line after the punt. On the first play of the drive, Reesing {{completed}} a 37-yard pass to Dexton Fields, putting the ball near midfield. Three straight incomplete passes later, Kansas faced a fourth-and-ten and a punt. Instead of punting the ball away, however, Kansas elected to try a risky fake punt-pass. Instead of snapping {{the ball to the}} punter, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> snapped to running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw the ball 22yards downfield to Micah Brown for a first down. On the very next play, Reesing, having returned to the field, connected on a 28-yard pass to Dexton Fields, who was pushed out of bounds just short of the goal line. With a first-and-goal from inside the one-yard line, a Kansas touchdown seemed inevitable. On the first play inside the red zone, however, Kansas fumbled the ball. Though <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> recovered by a Kansas player, the play lost fouryards. On the next play, Kansas committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. The personal foul was followed by a 10-yard holding penalty, and Kansas was pushed entirely outside the Virginia Tech red zone. In an effort to push back, Reesing threw a pass deep downfield. Instead of being completed, however, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> intercepted by Virginia Tech's D.J. Parker. With 39seconds left in the quarter, Virginia Tech had stopped Kansas from gaining a point despite the Jayhawks penetrating inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line.|$|E
5000|$|Throwing rules {{differ from}} regular Hooverball.

25|$|To grip <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for a leg-spinning delivery, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> {{placed into}} <b>the</b> palm with the seam {{parallel}} to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and <b>the</b> third and fourth fingers close together and rest {{against the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>The</b> first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> bowled, <b>the</b> third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> released, adding more spin. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> released.|$|R
50|$|In Australian rules football, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} out {{of bounds}} when the whole of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> outside <b>the</b> plane of boundary line; or, if any part of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> touches <b>the</b> behind post.|$|R
5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on {{the hand}} with a short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it difficult to}} position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle United hosted Chelsea at St James' Park in {{the fifth}} round of the competition. The home team came close to scoring after the midway point of the first half; Obafemi Martins's shot towards the Chelsea goal hit the {{underside}} of the crossbar and bounced down, before <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> cleared. In the 79th minute, Drogba – on as a substitute – scored the winning goal of the match, from a free-kick.|$|E
5|$|The Auburn Tigers upset {{expectations}} and tied the Commodores 7–7. Ammie Sikes scored first for Vanderbilt. Auburn scored after a Sikes fumble. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> kicked some fifteen yards down field {{clear of the}} melee, picked up by Kirk Newell, and run 55 yards to the end zone.|$|E

5|$|The first {{score of}} the game came when Wilson Collins got away for a 20-yard run, but fumbled. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> picked up by Zach Curlin and run in for a touchdown. When the game ended, Georgia men tried to steal the ball, and a fight broke out, broken up by coach McGugin and umpire Ted Coy.|$|E
5|$|Trailing by 11, {{and with}} time running down, Texas needed to score quickly. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. During the sack, Brown fumbled, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> {{picked up by}} Virginia Tech's Jim Baron who returned it {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 2810 with 5:06 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal got {{the game}} {{underway}} {{and won the}} first corner of the match. Taken by Paul Merson, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> flicked on at the near post by O'Leary and reached Alan Smith. The forward's header was obstructed by a Wrexham player, who proceeded to clear it out. It did not take long for Arsenal to create another chance; Nigel Winterburn played the ball down {{the left side of}} the pitch, finding Merson who ran in towards the penalty area and produced a cross. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> cleared, but reached Carter whose effort near the penalty spot went wide of the right-side post. Wrexham managed to get into the opposition's area and create half-chances, but then Arsenal broke forward again with Kevin Campbell having a shot on target. Gareth Owen nearly scored the opener, when he controlled the ball from a flick on and instinctively took a shot that whistled past the post. Two minutes before the interval, Arsenal took the lead. Merson surged forward into the penalty area and his cross was met Smith who slided the ball past goalkeeper Vince O'Keefe. Wrexham almost equalised immediately from the restart, but David Seaman denied Steve Watkin by rushing towards the midfielder and obstructing him.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the goal post. As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to keep the ball in match play. Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post. A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{replaced}} midfielder Jiří Jarošík with striker Eiður Guðjohnsen at {{the start}} of the second half, and started the second half in the same manner that they finished the first, with Liverpool withholding the pressure on their penalty area. Cole passed the ball over the Liverpool defence to Drogba in the 54th minute, but defender Jamie Carragher was able to get back and clear the ball. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> played back into the penalty area and met by Guðjohnsen, whose header was saved by Dudek, the ball fell to Gallas and Dudek again saved the subsequent shot. Midfielder Antonio Núñez replaced Harry Kewell in the 56th minute. Against the run of play, Liverpool had an attack in the 64th minute. A counter-attack results in a Dietmar Hamann shot, but it was saved by Čech. Liverpool made another substitution following the attack as Igor Bišćan replaced an injured Djimi Traoré. Chelsea continued to push forward and were close to a goal in the 71st minute, but Riise cleared a Gallas after <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> played to him by Makélélé. Both teams made substitutions in the following minutes. Striker Milan Baroš replaced Morientes for Liverpool while Chelsea substituted Gallas for striker Mateja Kežman.|$|E
