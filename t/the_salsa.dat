25|$|Globally, {{the term}} salsa has eclipsed the {{original}} {{names of the}} various Cuban musical genres it encompasses. Ironically, Cuban-based music was promoted more effectively worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s by <b>the</b> <b>salsa</b> industry, than by Cuba. For a brief time in the early 1990s {{a fair number of}} Cuban musicians embraced the term, calling their own music salsa Cubana. The practice did not catch on however.|$|E
25|$|When salsa uses non-Cuban rhythms, {{such as a}} Puerto Rican plena, guajeos are {{essential}} to tie that genre in with <b>the</b> <b>salsa</b> format.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>salsa</b> {{controversy}} is also {{closely tied to}} the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the United States embargo against Cuba. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from Cuban exiles) for playing Cuban records over the air. Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term salsa music was a euphemism for authentic Cuban music stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.|$|E

The Cents {{wound up with a}} record of 30–21–9 and 69 points. However, it wouldn't be the regular season that fans in Merritt would remember the most about the year, rather an improbable run to the Fred Page Cup Final. The Cents faced off against Prince George in the Interior Division opening round and promptly swept the Spruce Kings in four straight. They then met up in the Interior Conference final with the Penticton Panthers, who had finished the season first in the division, 29 points ahead of the Centennials. The first place Panthers proved to be no match for Merritt, as the Cents outscored Penticton 16 to 7 in a four-game sweep.
