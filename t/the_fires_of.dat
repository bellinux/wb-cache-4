5|$|During the Second World War, a Nazi {{task force}} assaults the Natural History Museum in London, {{which has been}} overrun by monsters. Later action would have {{involved}} {{the discovery of a}} secret chamber beneath the museum. This episode was written by Mark Gatiss and planned to air in the fourth series of Doctor Who, but was replaced by <b>The</b> <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> Pompeii. Elements of the story were later reused in Steven Moffat's The Big Bang, the finale of Series 5.|$|E
5|$|Prometheus– Punished by Zeus {{for giving}} mankind <b>the</b> <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that ripped out and ate his liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis. Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, died by self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called the Rage of the Titans. The character was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in God of War II.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent}} of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E

50|$|Several times, {{the town}} was devastated by fire; each time, it was rebuilt. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> January 1859 {{resulted}} in an $8,600 loss. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> August 1862 destroyed most of the town's business district, resulting in a $50,000 loss.|$|R
5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has festivals {{representing}} its cultural heritage. Twice each year, {{there is a}} Tejikara Fire Festival. It first occurs on the second Saturday of April at Tejikarao Shrine and it again occurs on the second Sunday of August at Nagara River Park. Half-naked men ring bells, and carry shrines and other devices that shoot off large sparks. Near the end of August, the city sponsors Takigi Noh, a traditional form of Japanese theater that takes place {{on the banks of}} the Nagara River, lit only by the surrounding bonfires and <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> cormorant boats.|$|E
5|$|The {{park service}} gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> <b>Of</b> the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E
40|$|<b>Firing</b> <b>the</b> {{manager is}} a drastic measure {{employed}} by firms {{to deal with}} poor performance. However, data on within-firm dynamics are scarce, and <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> individual managers is rarely recorded in the firm level data currently available. This makes <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> a manager difficult to assess. Data on sports offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study this phenomenon because <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a coach is usually well-publicized. Using data on soccer, the author evaluates <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a coach on team performance. As teams do not face the same opponents before and after a coach is <b>fired,</b> <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> sample selectivity is addressed. ...|$|R

5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1270 and 1390 {{that included the}} doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
