5|$|Bradley {{was born}} on April 15, 1978, in Harbor City, California. His mother, Charlena Rector, worked as a clerk at a local Safeway supermarket, while his father, Milton Bradley Sr., was {{a veteran of the}} Vietnam War, and was awarded a Purple Heart for his service. Bradley was named Milton Bradley Jr. when Milton Bradley Sr. filled out his son's birth {{certificate}} without Rector's permission. According to Bradley Jr.'s mother, Bradley Sr. was addicted <b>to</b> <b>cocaine,</b> physically abused her, and was homeless for several years. Growing up, Bradley had four half-siblings from Rector's previous marriage.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) {{wishes to}} conduct a further {{post-mortem}} on Laura's body, but it is due to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield and knocking him down. Later, Rosenfield shares what he has found; Laura had been bound when she was killed, had been addicted <b>to</b> <b>cocaine,</b> and had been clawed by a bird. An unidentified plastic shard was also found in her stomach.|$|E
50|$|An appreciable {{tolerance}} <b>to</b> <b>cocaine’s</b> high may develop, {{with many}} addicts reporting that they seek but fail to achieve as much pleasure {{as they did}} from their first experience. Some users will frequently increase their doses to intensify and prolong the euphoric effects. While tolerance to the high can occur, users might also become more sensitive (drug sensitization) <b>to</b> <b>cocaine's</b> local anesthetic (pain killing) and convulsant (seizure inducing) effects, without increasing the dose taken; this increased sensitivity may explain some deaths occurring after apparent low doses of cocaine.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, he {{was arrested}} for {{allegedly}} trying <b>to</b> sell <b>cocaine</b> <b>to</b> an undercover police officer in Denver. Smith pleaded guilty in March 2006 for conspiring <b>to</b> distribute <b>cocaine,</b> and was sentenced to {{two and a half years}} in federal prison that May.

5|$|One Hot Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject matters, such as drug use, depression, anguish, and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions <b>to</b> <b>cocaine</b> and heroin in 1994 after being sober {{for more than five}} years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure <b>to</b> <b>cocaine.</b> Prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E
5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted <b>to</b> <b>cocaine,</b> begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
50|$|As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was {{the only}} company in the US that is allowed <b>to</b> receive <b>cocaine,</b> which it has used <b>to</b> make <b>cocaine</b> hydrochloride, a {{prescription}} drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.|$|R

5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and cocaine. He {{has said that}} in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction <b>to</b> <b>cocaine.</b> In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|John was {{the eldest}} child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, {{and did not}} get on well with him, though {{he was close to}} his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After {{spending}} time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in part of the family seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to £35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction <b>to</b> <b>cocaine</b> and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating in the sale of the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol.|$|E
25|$|Other causes {{may include}} spasm of an artery. This may occur due <b>to</b> <b>cocaine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anxiety, paranoia, and restlessness {{can also}} occur, {{especially}} during the comedown. With excessive dosage, tremors, convulsions and increased body temperature are observed. Severe cardiac adverse events, particularly sudden cardiac death, become a serious risk at high doses due <b>to</b> <b>cocaine's</b> blocking effect on cardiac sodium channels.|$|R

25|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} reported that cocaine use causes congenital defects between 15 and 20% of the time; however another large-scale study found no difference in rates of birth anomalies in PCE and non-PCE infants. It has been suggested that some birth defects could be due <b>to</b> <b>cocaine's</b> disruption of blood vessel growth.|$|R
25|$|Townshend {{became a}} lower-profile {{follower}} after 1982, having felt that his former addictions <b>to</b> <b>cocaine</b> and heroin {{made him a}} poor candidate for spokesman. Nevertheless, his discipleship continues to the current day.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, Kudlow {{entered a}} twelve-step program {{in order to}} deal with his {{addiction}} <b>to</b> <b>cocaine</b> and alcohol. He subsequently converted to Catholicism under the guidance of Father C. John McCloskey III.|$|E
25|$|The NCO later {{branched}} out <b>to</b> <b>cocaine</b> trafficking, {{partly because it}} was less subject to police investigation than heroin, {{but also because the}} Sicilian Mafia was less involved in the cocaine trade.|$|E
50|$|Modafinil {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a possible method <b>to</b> treat <b>cocaine</b> dependence, for several reasons involving biochemical mechanisms of the two drugs, {{as well as the}} observation that clinical effects of modafinil are largely opposite <b>to</b> symptoms of <b>cocaine</b> withdrawal.|$|R

25|$|Clinical LAs {{belong to}} one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic LAs are {{structurally}} related <b>to</b> <b>cocaine.</b> They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have a very low abuse potential and do not produce hypertension or (with few exceptions) vasoconstriction.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} the effects that had been thought after early studies to be {{attributable}} to prenatal exposure <b>to</b> <b>cocaine</b> are actually due partially or wholly to other factors, such as exposure to other substances (including tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana) or to {{the environment in which}} the child is raised.|$|E
