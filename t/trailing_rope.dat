60|$|The boat {{drifted back}} to the {{schooner}} and bumped against her side until somebody caught a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope.</b> Marston with an effort climbed the rail and dropping on deck saw Wyndham at the wheel.|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{the small}} craft {{rose from the}} ground as Gahan leaped the inert bodies of the rykors lying in his path. The first of the pursuers sprang from the tower just as Gahan seized the <b>trailing</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>trail</b> <b>rope</b> was studied by the {{resistance}} and yawing experiments. A {{model of a}} tuna long liner of gross tonnage about 260 tons was used. Figures 1 and 2 show the plans of the experiments. When a boat makes head at a higher speed than 3 knots relative to the surface water, {{the effect on the}} course stability of the <b>trail</b> <b>rope</b> as a Jury rudder is very marked, while less so at a higher speed than 5 knots. In the case where the speed was 4. 4 knots, the boat without <b>trail</b> <b>rope</b> showed a critical yawing angle 12 °. The angle increased to 15 ° with rope of straight line type and to 24 ° with rope of U-line type. The boat with <b>trail</b> <b>rope,</b> especially of U-type, shows a faster damping period of yawing (Fig. 4 a and 4 b). This type of a Jury rudder seems to be very useful in the case of strong gale. ...|$|R

60|$|Quivering, {{not with}} fear but with rage, Ben Bolt perforce endured the {{buckling}} around his throat of a thick, broad collar of leather to which was attached a very stout {{and a very}} long <b>trailing</b> <b>rope.</b> After that, when Mulcachy had left the cage, {{one by one the}} five nooses were artfully manipulated off his legs and his neck. Again, after this prodigious indignity, he was free--within his cage. He went up into the air. With returning breath he roared his rage. He struck at the <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> that offended his nerves, clawed at the trap of the collar that encased his neck, fell, rolled over, offended his body-nerves more and more by entangling contacts with the rope, and for half an hour exhausted himself in the futile battle with the inanimate thing. Thus tigers are broken.|$|E
60|$|I {{was almost}} to the <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> by now. The craft was still rising slowly, the while it drifted from me. Then I {{stumbled}} on the icy way, striking my head upon a rock as I fell sprawling but an arm's length from the rope, {{the end of which}} was now just leaving the ground.|$|E
60|$|As I ran I saw Matai Shang clambering up the swaying, {{swinging}} ladder {{toward the}} deck, while above him leaned the evil {{face of the}} First Born. A <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> from the vessel's stern put new hope in me, for if I could but reach it before it whipped too high above my head there was yet a chance to gain the deck by its slender aid.|$|E
50|$|While {{this could}} explain {{the shape of the}} prints, sceptics have {{disagreed}} about whether the balloon could have travelled such a random zigzag course without its <b>trailing</b> <b>ropes</b> and shackles becoming caught in a tree or similar obstruction.|$|R

50|$|Ski {{areas have}} marked paths for skiing known as runs, trails or pistes. Ski areas {{typically}} {{have one or}} more chairlifts for moving skiers rapidly {{to the top of}} hills, and to interconnect the various <b>trails.</b> <b>Rope</b> tows can also be used on short slopes (usually beginner hills or bunny slopes). Larger ski areas may use gondolas or aerial trams for transportation across longer distances within the ski area.|$|R
60|$|Bellying {{closer to}} the ground, Ben Bolt {{advanced}} upon him, creeping slowly like a cat stalking a mouse. When he came to his next pause, which was within certain leaping distance, he crouched lower, gathered himself for the leap, then {{turned his head to}} regard the men at his back outside the cage. The <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> in their hands, to his neck, he had forgotten.|$|E
60|$|When they swung round a rocky point, Jimmy {{stopped the}} engine, and the launch ran in toward {{a small wooden}} pier. Dark pines rolled down to the water, and the swell broke angrily upon the beach and surged among the piles. There was nobody about, but Jimmy caught a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> abreast of a few steps where the water washed up and down, while the launch ground against the weedy timber.|$|E
60|$|It {{could not}} have been more than a few seconds that I lay {{senseless}} there upon the northern ice, while all that was dearest to me drifted farther from my reach in the clutches of that black fiend, for when I opened my eyes Thurid and Matai Shang yet battled at the ladder's top, and the flier drifted but a hundred yards farther to the south--but the end of the <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> was now a good thirty feet above the ground.|$|E

50|$|This trail {{traverses}} 50 meter- (164 ft-) high walls, dray waterfalls, and craters {{filled with}} water. This <b>trail</b> requires <b>rope</b> to complete.|$|R
60|$|While all this, {{along with}} many other noises, squealings of boat-boys and shouts of Borckman, was {{impacting}} on Jerry's ear-drums, he was still sliding down the steep deck of his new and unstable world. But he did not bring up against the rail where his fragile ribs might well have been broken. Instead, the warm ocean water, pouring inboard across the buried rail in a flood of pale phosphorescent fire, cushioned his fall. A raffle of <b>trailing</b> <b>ropes</b> entangled him as he struck out to swim.|$|R
60|$|The turn {{of affairs}} {{had been so}} sudden that Shepley and Van Blott were taken {{completely}} by surprise, as were likewise the sailors who had sided with the rascals, and, for the moment, none of them knew exactly what to do. In the meantime the canoe bumped alongside of the Stormy Petrel, and, catching hold of a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> thrown overboard by the sailor named Diski, Captain Marshall hauled himself to the deck, followed by Billy Dill and the boys.|$|E
60|$|They {{were now}} {{scarcely}} a fathom from the trailing wreckage, and the schooner's rail was dipping lower. It seemed just possible to clutch it by a desperate leap, {{and the next}} moment Harry launched himself out into the air. Frank followed, struck the wet planking, and seizing a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> held on by it with his legs in the sea. Then he dragged himself up clear of the water, and Harry, who was kneeling in the opening in the broken rail, reached down to him.|$|E
60|$|Clear and {{perfectly}} conscious now, though frantically fighting for existence with the current, he could dimly see a floating black object shooting by the shore, at times striking the {{projections of the}} bank, until in its recoil it swung half round and drifted broadside on towards him. He was near enough to catch the frayed ends of a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> that fastened the structure, {{which seemed to be}} a few logs, together. With a convulsive effort he at last gained a footing upon it, and then fell fainting along its length. It was the raft which the surveyors from the embarcadero had just abandoned.|$|E
50|$|As of 2014, the OAC {{contains}} {{approximately two}} miles of <b>trails,</b> a <b>ropes</b> course, a nature-themed playground, a tree house classroom, a 650-gallon freshwater aquarium, and a multi-purpose building.|$|R
50|$|A pier {{adjacent}} to the fallen pier needed to be stabilised, and this was done by driving a timber pier to support it. During {{the course of this}} work, the barge carrying the contractor's piling rig broke away at night when it was anchored unmanned. Again in flood tide conditions to travelled upstream. The Resident Engineer commandeered a power launch and tried to board the barge and take control, but his propellers were fouled by <b>trailing</b> <b>ropes</b> and he was unable to do so. The barge then drifted downstream on the subsequent ebb tide, and the crane jib struck the bridge, causing the collapse of the crane jib.|$|R
50|$|Artegon Marketplace, {{formerly}} known as Festival Bay Mall, was an enclosed shopping mall located on International Drive in Orlando, Florida, United States. Opened in 2002 as a property of the Belz Factory Outlets, it is owned by FB Orlando Acquisition Company, LLC and managed by Paragon Outlet Partners LLC. The mall was 860000 sq ft in size with Bass Pro Shops, Boot Barn, Book Warehouse, Gods & Monsters, and Ron Jon Surf Shop as anchor stores. It also comprised several entertainment venues, including a Cinemark movie theater, Sky Zone Trampoline Park, Sky <b>Trail</b> <b>Ropes</b> Course, Gods & Monsters, and a Putting Edge glow-in-the-dark miniature golf course.|$|R
60|$|The panther {{recovered}} himself {{almost immediately}} and, wheeling, tore after his prey, the ape-boy's rope dragging {{along the ground}} behind him. In doubling back after Tarzan, Sheeta had passed around a low bush. It was a mere nothing {{in the path of}} any jungle creature of the size and weight of Sheeta--provided it had no <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> dangling behind. But Sheeta was handicapped by such a rope, and as he leaped once again after Tarzan of the Apes the rope encircled the small bush, became tangled in it and brought the panther to a sudden stop. An instant later Tarzan was safe among the higher branches of a small tree into which Sheeta could not follow him.|$|E
60|$|For {{half an hour}} he {{roamed the}} arena, which was the {{greatest}} area of restricted freedom he had known in the ten weeks of his captivity. Then, a hooked iron rod, thrust through the bars, caught and drew the bight of his <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> {{into the hands of}} the men outside. Immediately ten of them had hold of it, and he would have charged up to the bars at them had not, at that moment, Mulcachy entered the arena through a door on the opposite side. No bars stood between Ben Bolt and this creature, and Ben Bolt charged him. Even as he charged he was aware of suspicion in that the small, fragile man-creature before him did not flee or crouch down, but stood awaiting him.|$|E
6000|$|Bert {{followed}} him, and collided, without upsetting, with {{a fisherman}} bent upon a similar errand. A woman carrying {{a baby in}} her arms, two small boys with toy spades, and a stout gentleman in flannels all got to the <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> {{at about the same}} time, and began to dance over it in their attempts to secure it. Bert came up to this wriggling, elusive serpent and got his foot on it, went down on all fours and achieved a grip. In half a dozen seconds the whole diffused population of the beach had, as it were, crystallised on the rope, and was pulling against the balloon under the vehement and stimulating directions of the man in the car. [...] "Pull, I tell you!" [...] said the man in the car--"pull!" ...|$|E
50|$|Often {{abbreviated}} as CAVOC, the Cedric A. Vig Outdoor Classroom {{is named}} for the late Cedric Vig. CAVOC was founded in the late 1970s, to educate students about the outdoors. CAVOC also provides wetland trails, ski <b>trails,</b> and <b>rope</b> courses.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the waters}} around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly upheaved, as if {{sideways}} sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly {{rising to the}} surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with <b>trailing</b> <b>ropes,</b> and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered {{for a moment in}} the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.|$|R
6000|$|The second hour {{found him}} {{examining}} the equipment {{of the car}} with great particularity. Above him was the throat of the balloon bunched and tied together, but with an open lumen through which Bert could peer up into a vast, empty, quiet interior, and out of which descended two fine cords of unknown import, one white, one crimson, to pockets below the ring. The netting about the balloon-ended in cords attached to the ring, a big steel-bound hoop to which the car was slung by ropes. From it depended the <b>trail</b> <b>rope</b> and grapnel, and over {{the sides of the}} car were a number of canvas bags that Bert decided must be ballast to [...] "chuck down" [...] if the balloon fell. ("Not much falling just yet," [...] said Bert.) ...|$|R
60|$|The robbers waved {{a defiant}} adieu and plunged {{down the steep}} slope into the thick woods that lined the track. Five minutes of {{crashing}} through a thicket of chaparral brought them to open woods, where three horses were tied to low-hanging branches. One was waiting for John Big Dog, who would never ride by night or day again. This animal the robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free. They mounted the other two with the bag across one pommel, and rode fast and with discretion through the forest and up a primeval, lonely gorge. Here the animal that bore Bob Tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and broke a foreleg. They shot him through the head at once {{and sat down to}} hold a council of flight. Made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they had travelled, the question of time was no longer so big. Many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse that could follow. Shark Dodson's horse, with <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> and dropped bridle, panted and cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the gorge. Bob Tidball opened the sack, drew out double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and chuckled with the glee of a child.|$|E
50|$|Leach {{and several}} other crewmen ambush Larsen and throw him and his first mate overboard. However, Larsen manages to grab a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope,</b> climb back aboard, and put down the mutiny. Larsen cannot afford to lose any men, so instead of {{punishing}} them, he betrays his informant, the ship’s cook (Barry Fitzgerald), to them. They drop him in the water, holding onto a rope for dear life. Before they can pull him back in though, a shark bites off his leg.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{performers}} who portrayed the Queen during the series included Mary Gallien (who later became Dr. Mary De Longis) and Mary Jose. In the episode [...] "The Hanged Man", male stuntman Curro doubled for the Queen to perform {{one of the}} most dangerous stunt in a Western involving a moving wagon and horses, when dressed as the Queen, Curro jumped from the wagon onto the horses then passed under the horses and wagon, grabbed a <b>trailing</b> <b>rope</b> and was dragged along the ground from where he hauled himself back on to the rear of the wagon. This was performed in the style of Yakima Canutt, who first performed the stunt in the films Stagecoach and Riders of the Dawn.|$|E
60|$|He {{was perhaps}} ten {{feet above the}} people {{when he made his}} decision. His {{paralysis}} ceased. He leapt up on the seat, and, at imminent risk of falling headlong, released the grapnel-rope from the toggle that held it, sprang on to the <b>trail</b> <b>rope</b> and disengaged that also. A hoarse shout of disgust greeted the descent of the grapnel-rope and the swift leap of the balloon, and something--he fancied afterwards it was a turnip--whizzed by his head. The trail-rope followed its fellow. The crowd seemed to jump away from him. With an immense and horrifying rustle the balloon brushed against a telephone pole, and for a tense instant he anticipated either an electric explosion or a bursting of the oiled silk, or both. But fortune was with him.|$|R
50|$|Uncle Tom's Trail {{has been}} {{maintained}} and improved by the National Park Service. While the original <b>trail</b> had <b>rope</b> ladders and 528 steps.

5000|$|In May 2014, Moody Gardens {{opened the}} tallest steel ropes {{course on the}} Gulf Coast. The five-tier Sky <b>Trail</b> <b>Ropes</b> Course (or [...] "challenge course") is five stories tall - {{standing}} at 81 ft tall - and features 48 obstacles (or [...] "elements") with the obstacles gradually getting harder with each tier. The Moody Gardens Zip Line is 500 ft long and is connected to another steel tower located {{at the far end}} of Palm Beach next to the wave pool - suspending visitors 60 ft above Palm Beach, allowing them to get a bird's eye view of the Moody Gardens pyramids and tropical gardens. The ropes course and zip line was manufactured, installed, and is serviced by Ropes Courses Inc. The ropes course and zip line is open year-round during the weekend and the weekdays during school holidays and the weekday evening during Festival of Lights.|$|R
