Also, possibility of getting energy surplus or over-unity energy by using pendulum as parametric oscillator will be discussed. In this work the following will be discuss:- <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> angular momentum,- angular momentum and conflict with <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> total energy in orbits of central forces (gravitational, electrostatic, etc.),- angular momentum and corruption of centrifugal force,- an experiment of increasing potential and kinetic energy {{in the same time}} when <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> angular momentum was supposed to be valid,- possibility of getting energy surplus out of pendulum which works as parametric oscillator,- importance of egg shaped forms and angular momentum for fluids...|$|R

5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} listed on Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Conservation</b> <b>of</b> Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).
