50|$|In Alexandre Dumas' The Vicomte de Bragelonne, {{although}} the plot to replace King Louis XIV with his twin brother is foiled, the twin is initially {{depicted as a}} much more sympathetic character than the King.

In the 1929 silent version, The Iron Mask starring Douglas Fairbanks as D'Artagnan, the King is depicted favorably and the twin brother as a pawn in an evil plot whose <b>thwarting</b> <b>by</b> D'Artagnan and his companions seems more appropriate.|$|R
