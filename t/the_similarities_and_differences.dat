5|$|Classic TV Press {{published}} the book Worlds Apart: an unofficial and unauthorised {{guide to the}} BBC's remake of Survivors (March 2010), written by Rich Cross, shortly after transmission of the second series completes. The book incorporates: in depth synopses and reviews for all the episodes from Series 1 and 2; insights into {{the making of the}} series; examination of <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the new series and the 1970s series; a photographic guide to filming locations; and exclusive production shots.|$|E

This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. <b>The</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order {{from any of the}} other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E

25|$|Early naturalists well {{understood}} <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> of living species leading Linnaeus {{to develop a}} hierarchical classification system still in use today. Darwin and his contemporaries first linked the hierarchical structure of {{the tree of life}} with the then very sparse fossil record. Darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification, or evolution, whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures, or they perish.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues {{in the study}} of evolution. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of molecular biology; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the ribosome and organelles, the development of embryos with body plans, the vertebrate immune system) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between humans and our closest relatives (the primates, and indeed the other mammals) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands {{are very}} common in this biome, {{including}} lakes, shallow open water, marshes, and grassy wetlands. Glacial erosion has contributed to such features by creating depressions in which standing water can collect. In the larger depressions, permanent lakes or ponds of water remain. Many of the lakes have a saline character, thus most shore vegetation has a high tolerance of salty soils. These lakes are known as alkali lakes. Wet meadows are flooded {{in the spring and}} dry by fall. They contain rushes, sedges and grasses and provide excellent opportunities to study <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> of these forms of vegetation.|$|E

25|$|Experiments on twin {{children}} in concentration camps {{were created to}} show <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> in the genetics of twins, {{as well as to}} see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated. The central leader of the experiments was Josef Mengele, who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz. About 200 people survived these studies. The twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in barracks between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to see whether it would change their color to sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> in the experiences of the Whiteoak family and de la Roche's. While the lives and successes of the Whiteoaks rise and fall, there remained for them the steadiness of the family manor, known as Jalna. De la Roche's family endured the illness of her mother, the perpetual job searches of her father, and the adoption of her orphaned cousin while being moved 17 times. Several critics believe that Finch Whiteoak who majors in Finch's Fortune (1932) is a reflection of de la Roche herself. He was a somewhat tortured concert pianist with overtones of gayness. The names of many of the characters were taken from gravestones in a Newmarket, Ontario cemetery.|$|E
25|$|There were {{questions}} about the actual content of the map. Witten had pointed out that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner Andrea Bianco, but others found some of <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> very strange—the map cuts off Africa where Bianco's map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions {{in the far east}} and west. The most surprising revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous Cantino World Map, the Vinland Map depicts Greenland as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while Norway, of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of Claudius Clavus in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, Arctic sea ice may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent Japan—they seem to show not only Honshu, but also Hokkaido and Sakhalin, omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.|$|E

[...] The Rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E

Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance {{in some of the}} things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|E
500|$|Many {{types of}} mimicry have been described. An {{overview}} of each follows, highlighting <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> {{between the various}} forms. Classification is often based on function {{with respect to the}} mimic (e.g., avoiding harm). Some cases may belong to more than one class, e.g., automimicry and aggressive mimicry are not mutually exclusive, as one describes the species relationship between model and mimic, while the other describes the function for the mimic (obtaining food). The terminology used is not without debate and attempts to clarify have led to new terms being included. The term [...] "masquerade" [...] is sometimes used when the model is inanimate but it is differentiated from [...] "crypsis" [...] in its strict sense by the potential response of the signal receiver. In crypsis the receiver is assumed to not respond while a masquerader confuses the recognition system of the receiver that would otherwise seek the signaller. In the other forms of mimicry, the signal is not filtered out by the sensory system of the receiver. These are not mutually exclusive and in the evolution of wasp-like appearance, {{it has been argued that}} insects evolve to masquerade wasps since predatory wasps do not attack each other but this mimetic resemblance also deters vertebrate predators.|$|E
