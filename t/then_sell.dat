5|$|During the Tudor and Stuart periods, horse {{ownership}} {{was more}} widespread in Britain than in continental Europe, but it suffered {{a decline in}} the harsh economic environment of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With economic recovery, the number of horse owners increased again. Travel became more popular, along with the hiring of horses, although a common practice at the time was for a traveller to buy a horse for a journey, and <b>then</b> <b>sell</b> it on arrival at his destination. Horses had been raced in Britain for hundreds of years by the time of King James VI of Scotland (1567– 1625), but he brought the sport as it is known today into England from Scotland while he was king of both countries (1603– 1625); he organised public races in a number of places, and continued to import quality animals aimed at the development of a new, lighter, faster type of horse.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and <b>then</b> <b>sell</b> the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Though the Halifax {{area was}} settled by aboriginals, {{particularly}} the Mi'kmaq people, {{as early as}} 7000 BC, there is no archaeological evidence of native habitation on Melville Island prior {{to the arrival of}} the Europeans. The first Europeans to reach the land were likely French traders and missionaries in the 17th century. Halifax was founded by the British in 1749. The first documented use of Melville Island was by Robert Cowie and John Aubony, who obtained a Crown grant in 1752 to allow them to build a storehouse. After Cowie's death in 1781, John Butler Kelly purchased what was then known as Cowie's Island and quickly resold it in 1784 to James Kavanagh, the head of a prosperous family fishery, for £65. Kavanagh used the land, known as Kavanagh's Island according to the then-prevalent tradition of place naming, to dry and store fish that he would <b>then</b> <b>sell</b> from his Halifax store.|$|E
