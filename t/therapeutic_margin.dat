50|$|Digitalis lanata {{contains}} a powerful cardiac glycoside {{that may be}} used by patients with heart conditions. Digoxin (digitalin) is a drug that is extracted from Digitalis lanata. It is used to treat some heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation. It slows atrioventricular conduction so that the heartbeat slows down and slightly increases contraction power (positive inotropic effect). Because of the improved circulation in congestive heart failure caused by fast atrial fibrillation, the kidneys can function better, which stimulates the flow of urine, which lowers the volume of the blood and lessens the load on the heart. This is the effect that was first described when the plant was discovered as a medicine (Withering 1785).Digitalin was not discovered until the mid-19th century by two French scientists Homolle Ouevenne and Theodore Ouevenne. It was not until 1875 that Oscar Schmiedberg identified digoxin in the plant. It was first isolated in the 1930s in Britain by Sydney Smith. At that time it was used to treat ulcers in the lower abdomen, boils, headaches, abscesses, and paralysis, and externally healing wounds. Today it is still extracted from the plant because synthetis is quite expensive and difficult. However, it is becoming less frequently used due to the narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin</b> and high potential for severe side effects. Digoxin is being replaced by newer drugs including beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the calcium channel blocking agents. As new pharmacotherapeutic agents arise, the use of digitalis preparations is expected to continue to decline. There are also other commercial uses for Digitalis lanata other than heart conditions. For example, in South America the powdered leaves are used to relieve asthma, as sedatives, and as diuretics. In India it is included in an ointment that contains digitalis glycosides used to treat wounds and burns.|$|E

Tumor vascular disruption is a therapeutic strategy of great potential; however, VDAs currently under development display a narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin,</b> with cardiovascular toxicity posing a dose-limiting obstacle. Discovery of new VDAs, which display a wider <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin,</b> may allow attainment of improved clinical outcomes. To identify such compounds, we used an in vitro selectivity screening approach that exploits {{the fact that}} tumor endothelial cells are {{in a constant state}} of activation and angiogenesis and do not undergo senescence. Our effort yielded the compound BNC 105. This compound acts as a tubulin polymerization inhibitor and displays 80 -fold higher potency against endothelial cells that are actively proliferating or are engaged in the formation of in vitro capillaries compared with nonproliferating endothelial cells or endothelium found in stable capillaries. This selectivity was not observed with CA 4, a VDA currently under evaluation in phase III clinical trials. BNC 105 is more potent and offers a wider therapeutic window. CA 4 produces 90 % vascular disruption at its no observed adverse event level (NOAEL), whereas BNC 105 causes 95 % vascular disruption at 1 / 8 th of its NOAEL. Tissue distribution analysis of BNC 105 in tumor-bearing mice showed that while the drug is cleared from all tissues 24 hours after administration, it is still present at high concentrations within the solid tumor mass. Furthermore, BNC 105 treatment causes tumor regressions with complete tumor clearance in 20 % of treated animals. Gabriel Kremmidiotis, Annabell F. Leske, Tina C.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin</b> of aminoglycoside therapy may be improved by manipulation of dosing strategy. Recent understanding of concentration-dependent bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect argues that the aminoglycosides may be administered in larger doses and at longer dosing intervals than currently recommended without compromising efficacy. Preliminary clinical experience suggests that once-daily regimens are as efficacious as conventional intermittent injections in the treatment of gram-negative infections including urinary tract infections, cystic fibrosis, and bacteremia in nonneutropenic patients. The transient. high peak serum concentrations achieved in once-daily dosing have not been associated with excessive nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity thus far. Decreased accumulation in renal cortex as a result of saturable renal uptake after the single daily dose may even reduce the incidence o...|$|E

40|$|Drug {{development}} has improved over recent decades, with refinements in analytical techniques, population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling and simulation, and new biomarkers of efficacy and tolerability. Yet this progress has not yielded improvements in individualization {{of treatment and}} monitoring, owing to various obstacles: monitoring is complex and demanding, many monitoring procedures have been instituted without critical assessment of the underlying evidence and rationale, controlled clinical trials are sparse, monitoring procedures are poorly validated and both drug manufacturers and regulatory authorities take insufficient account {{of the importance of}} monitoring. Drug concentration and effect data should be increasingly collected, analyzed, aggregated and disseminated in forms suitable for prescribers, along with efficient monitoring tools and evidence-based recommendations regarding their best use.

Methods for aggregating PK-PD data in systematic reviews should be devised. Observational and intervention studies to evaluate monitoring procedures are needed.

40|$|The individualization of {{anti-cancer}} {{therapy has}} been given much attention over the past decade. There has been a focus on differences between patients in tumor characteristics, but also the individualization of the given dose is extremely important. Many anti-cancer agents have a very narrow therapeutic window, {{which means that the}} range between drug concentrations at which severe toxicity is observed during treatment and the levels at which the drug has sub-therapeutic effects is small. As a result of these small <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margins,</b> the individual variability in toxicity during treatment and efficacy of treatment is large. The work described in this thesis provides a pharmacological approach contributing to the knowledge of factors influencing the metabolism and toxicity profiles of three anti-cancer agents known for their large inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: the taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel, and the anti-hormonal agent tamoxifen. Both environmental factors (i. e. smoking) as well as genetic factors (polymorphisms in genes coding for metabolizing enzymes and uptake/efflux transporters) were investigated in translational studies, including cell line experiments, mice experiments, and studies in patients with cancer. Finally, both an endogenous marker and exogenous marker were correlated with taxane and tamoxifen pharmacokinetics, respectively. Future studies should focus on further exploring factors that may influence systemic exposure of anti-cancer agents with a small therapeutic window. Ultimately, bringing these factors together in a predictive model that can be tested and validated in large cohorts of cancer patients should lead to more evidence-based dosing regimens for these drugs...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: While {{respiratory}} {{motion compensation}} for MR-guided HIFU interventions {{has been extensively}} studied, the influence of slow physiological motion due to, for example, peristaltic activity, {{has so far been}} largely neglected. During lengthy interventions, the magnitude of the latter can exceed acceptable <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margins.</b> The goal of the present study is to exploit the episodic work-flow of these therapies to implement a motion correction strategy for slowly varying drifts of the target area and organs at risk over the entire duration of the intervention. Methods: The therapeutic work-flow of an MR-guided HIFU intervention is in practice often episodic: Bursts of energy delivery are interleaved with periods of inactivity, allowing the effects of the beam on healthy tissues to recede and/or during which the plan of the intervention is re-optimized. These periods usually last for at least several minutes. It is at this time scale that organ drifts due to slow physiological motion become significant. In order to capture these drifts we propose the integration of 3 D MR scans in the therapy work-flow during the inactivity intervals. Displacements were estimated using an optical flow algorithm applied on the 3 D acquired images. A preliminary study was conducted on 10 healthy volunteers. For each volunteer 3 D MR images of the abdomen were acquired at regular intervals of 10 min over a total duration of 80 min. Motion analysis was restricted to the liver and kidneys. For validating the compatibility of the proposed motion correction strategy with the work-flow of an MR-guided HIFU therapy, an in-vivo experiment on a porcine liver was conducted. A volumetric HIFU ablation was completed over a time span of 2 h. A 3 D image was acquired before the first sonication, as well as after each sonication. Results: Following the volunteer study, drifts larger than 8 mm for the liver and 5 mm for the kidneys prove that slow physiological motion can exceed acceptable <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margins.</b> In the animal experiment motion tracking revealed an initial shift of up to 4 mm during the first 10 min and a subsequent continuous shift of ∼ 2 mm/h {{until the end of the}} intervention. This leads to a continuously increasing mismatch of the initial shot planning, the thermal dose measurements and the true underlying anatomy. The estimated displacements allowed correcting the planned sonication cell cluster positions to the true target position, as well as the thermal dose estimates during the entire intervention and to correct the NPV-measurement. A spatial coherence of all three is particularly important to assure a confluent ablation volume and to prevent remaining islets of viable malignant tissue. Conclusions: This study proposes a motion correction strategy for displacements resulting from slowly varying physiological motion that might occur during an MR-guided HIFU intervention. We have shown that such drifts can lead to a misalignment between interventional planning, energy delivery and therapeutic validation.

Similarly, considerable variation {{in the quality of}} melanoma care in the United States when assessed using 26 quality indicators drawn by a panel of melanoma experts was independently reported. These observations underscore the significant lack of adherence to published best practice patterns reflected by the NCCN guidelines. The untoward effects of these variations in practice pattern can have an inordinate impact on the survival of melanoma patients in whom long term outcomes are affected by the adequacy of surgical management. Thin malignant melanoma is curable; however, thick or node positive melanoma is often incurable. This outcome is determined not only by the stage at presentation but by the use of best practice patterns as reflected in current NCCN cutaneous melanoma practice guidelines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{powdered}} Stachytarpheta jamaicensis L. leaves known for treating different ailments was investigated for toxicity. In the study, twenty Wister rats (male and female) after due acclimatization, were fed with different graded mixtures of feed mash {{and the treatment}} plant. The animals were weighed and divided into four groups of three treatment groups and one control group with each group consisting of five rats. The rats were administered different concentrations {{of powdered}} S. jamaicensis leaves mixed with different amount of feed mash. i. e., 75, 50 and 25 g of S. jamaicensis was mixed with 25, 50 and 75 g of normal feed mash. The control was fed only with feed mash all through the period of experiment. The results revealed levels of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) were slightly elevated (p> 0. 05). Bilirubin levels in all the groups showed slight variation (p> 0. 05) when compared with control. The ultrasound picture of heart, liver, kidney and spleen showed no significant difference from control. From the results obtained, no significant alteration in the normal serum biochemistry {{as well as in}} the echogenic pattern was identified between the control and experimental rats thus suggesting wide <b>therapeutic</b> safety <b>margin</b> in the use of S. jamaicensis...|$|R
40|$|The pharmacologic {{interventions}} {{for treatment of}} acute repetitive seizures and those for treatment of status epilepticus are similar. The choice of treatment {{should be based on}} the drug’s onset of action, spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, route and ease of administration, elimination half-life, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin</b> of safety, and redistribution from the central nervous system. Treatment should be initiated early in patients who are prone to seizure clusters or prolonged partial seizures that may generalize or progress to status epilepticus. Benzodiazepines have become first-line drugs for treatment of acute seizures and status epilepticus, followed by phenytoin/fosphenytoin and phenobarbital. Short-acting benzodi-azepines, including diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and midazolam, can decrease the frequency of emergency department visits if given at the appropriate times. The recently approved intravenous formulation of valproate may be of use in chil-dren receiving oral valproate who develop breakthrough seizures caused by subtherapeutic plasma levels that are secondary to missed doses or an inability to tolerate oral valproate. (J Child Neurol 1998; 13 (Suppl 1) :S 23 -S 26). Seizures and status epilepticus are among the most common neurologic emergencies in children and adolescents. The management of acute seizures can be initiated by emer-gency medical technicians or paramedics responding to...|$|E
40|$|Background: Radiotherapy {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of lung cancer, with both curative and palliative intent according to the stage of the disease. The tumour control potential of radiotherapy is limited by the induction of side effects; in the case of thoracic radiotherapy (tRTX), common side effects are oesophagitis, pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. The main challenges in the field are, therefore, to find ways to increase tumour killing and/or decrease normal tissue toxicity, to improve the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin</b> of radiation. Aims: Firstly, to characterise selected early and late tissue responses in a mouse model of tRTX. Secondly, to investigate approaches to improve the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin</b> of tRTX by modulating the inflammatory response or the DNA damage response (DDR). Methods: To evaluate normal tissue responses, we used tRTX of C 57 BL 6 mice, a well-established preclinical model of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In parallel, human lung cancer cells were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in immune compromised nude mice, and used to evaluate anti-tumour responses. A/J mice bearing urethane-induced lung tumours were used to evaluate normal and tumour lung tissue responses simultaneously. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and non-invasive imaging were used to assess treatment responses. Results: Acute and transient local (neutrophil lung infiltration) and systemic (plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines) inflammatory/immune responses were induced by tRTX. Thoracic radiation induced DNA double-strand breaks in lung tissue, a proportion of which were persistent. Fractionation schedules of tRTX led to pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Knock-out of myeloperoxidase activity was associated with decreased early and late normal tissue responses to tRTX. In separate mouse models, we observed that DDR inhibitors effectively radiosensitised xenograft tumours, but differentially affected thoracic normal tissues. PARP inhibition in combination with tRTX lead to oesophagitis whereas ATM inhibition increased radiation-induced lung damage. Using the A/J strain, we simultaneously evaluated normal and tumour lung tissues responses to tRTX, establishing a novel mouse model for the study of therapeutic index. In the A/J model, ATM inhibition in combination with tRTX showed significant anti-tumour activity, but was also associated with increased late normal tissue effects. Conclusions: Myeloperoxidase contributes to early inflammatory responses and late effects induced by tRTX. DDR inhibitors have similar tumour responses but differential normal tissue responses when combined to tRTX. A newly established A/J mouse model has the potential to {{have a significant impact on}} studies evaluating the therapeutic index of novel therapies in combination with thoracic radiation by allowing for the simultaneous assessment of normal and tumour lung tissues in the context of a fully functional immune system...|$|E
40|$|Bupropion is an {{atypical}} antidepressant with {{a unique}} aminoketone structure similar to amphetamines. A narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>margin</b> is evident from observational studies that show seizure activity with doses of 400 - 600 mg or higher. A 38 -year old woman took an overdose of 6 grams of bupropion with 110 grams of alcohol. She presented to the Emergency Department with agitation, visual hallucinations and myoclonus of the upper limbs; eyes spontaneously open with isochoric and light reactive pupils with horizontal nystagmus; afebrile, normotensive (121 / 63 mm Hg) and tachycardic (120 beats/minute). The electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with prolonged QT interval (QT/QTc: 0. 46 / 0. 537) and a QRS complex length in the upper limit of normal. Arterial blood gases revealed metabolic acidosis (pH = 7. 16) with increased anion-gap (value= 18). She developed mal epilepticus needing thiopental induced coma and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. She suffered prolonged symptoms including seizures before fully recovering. The narrow therapeutic range and the increasing use {{in the treatment of}} smoking cessation boosted the number of intentional and unintentional poisoning by this drug. Previous reports of bupropion overdose almost all involve the immediate release formulation. There are some reports of overdose with sustained-release formulation, but there is limited information on its spectrum of toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{antiplatelet}} agents, {{specifically the}} thienopyridines, {{has become a}} standard of care in the approach to the patient presenting with an acute coronary syndrome. These drugs irreversibly inhibit the platelet by permanently binding to the surface P 2 Y 12 receptor and blocking the downstream fibrinogen cross-linking between platelets, which leads to aggregation and thrombus. However, currently available therapeutic choices are limited by potential interaction with other medications, slow hepatic conversion to active metabolite, genetic resistance, and narrow <b>therapeutic</b> safety <b>margin.</b> In order to overcome these disadvantages, {{there has been an}} interest in developing alternatives to thienopyridines. Recent investigations have included ticagrelor, a reversible inhibitor of the P 2 Y 12 platelet receptor, which appears to have overcome several drawbacks of the current thienopyridines. Its unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles result in an inhibition of platelet aggregation that is rapid, high, consistent, and less susceptible to interpatient variability than currently available P 2 Y 12 inhibitors. In addition, ticagrelor offers a potential mortality advantage not apparent with current agents. Although questions regarding the nature, magnitude, and clinical significance of several observed adverse effects (dyspnea and ventricular pauses) remain unanswered, it appears that ticagrelor may represent a significant advancement over currently available oral antiplatelet agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to verify its <b>therapeutic</b> effects and <b>margin</b> of safety for human body. Besides exploring the new pharmacological and biological activities of Cyperus rotundus one of the aspects of present research is to reproduce the standard method of preliminary screening of medicinal plants. This is achieved through the extracting of mixture of pharmacological active compounds and also through their fractions. The fractions are made in different solvent to separate the compounds and then performed different activities on various parameters. Extract of the plant and fractions were 'correlated with the effectiveness in term of percent of response and presented graphically. The graphs represent the comparative best pharmacological and biological activities. The world wide increasing demand for medicines from natural sources has motivated search for drugs with potential hypotensive activity as well. Aqueous extract of C. rotundus caused a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats in a dose dependent manner. At the dose of 3 mg/kg the mean arterial blood pressure was found to reduce by 42. 6...|$|R

Publications on 58 topics were assessed during six 5 -year periods from 1984 to 2013. Our analysis showed that during 2009 – 2013, out of seven anesthetics with a high general popularity index (≥ 2. 0), only two were introduced after 1980, ie, the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane and the local anesthetic ropivacaine; however, only sevoflurane had a high index of expectations (12. 1). Among anesthetic adjuncts, in 2009 – 2013, only one agent, sugammadex, had both an extremely high index of change (> 100) and a high index of expectations (25. 0), reflecting the novelty of its mechanism of action. The index of ultimate success was positive with three anesthetics, ie, lidocaine, isoflurane, and propofol, all of which were introduced much longer than 30 years ago. For the past 30 years, there were no new anesthetics that have produced changes in scientometric indices indicating real progress.
