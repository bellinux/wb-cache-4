500|$|By 1762, Johnson {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for being a slow worker. Contemporary poet Charles Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and <b>takes</b> <b>your</b> cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon stung Johnson into renewed work. It was only in 20 July 1762, when he received the first payment on a government pension of 300 pounds a year, that he no longer had to worry about money and was finally able to dedicate most of his time to finishing the work.|$|E
500|$|Like many of {{the songs}} on Highway 61 Revisited, [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] has {{abundant}} literary references, including images recalling Malcolm Lowry's novel Under the Volcano and a street name taken from Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue". The song also uses the phrase [...] "housing project hill" [...] which is taken from Jack Kerouac's novel Desolation Angels. A number of Dylan biographers, including Colin Irwin, Robert Shelton and Andy Gill, {{have suggested that the}} song's title makes reference to Arthur Rimbaud's poem [...] "My Bohemian Life (Fantasy)", in which Rimbaud refers to himself as [...] "Tom Thumb in a daze." [...] In addition, some commentators have suggested {{that there may be a}} musical reference in the lines [...] "And she <b>takes</b> <b>your</b> voice/And leaves you howling at the moon," [...] since [...] "Howlin' at the Moon" [...] is the title of a song by Hank Williams, a musician whom Dylan admired.|$|E
500|$|By 1762, however, Johnson {{had gained}} notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the {{contemporary}} poet Churchill teased Johnson {{for the delay}} in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and <b>takes</b> <b>your</b> cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare, and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, {{he was able to}} dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension [...] "is not given you for anything you are to do, but for what you have done".|$|E

50|$|<b>Take</b> <b>Your</b> Dog to Work Day (TYDTWDay) {{was created}} by Pet Sitters International and first celebrated in 1999.

500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it <b>takes</b> <b>your</b> breath away." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{romantic comedy}} America's Sweethearts was Zeta-Jones' sole film project of 2001. She starred as a shrewd movie star, {{opposite}} Julia Roberts who featured as her character's under-confident sibling. The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical Singin' in the Rain (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly [...] "chilly and manipulative" [...] in her part. The following year, Zeta-Jones starred alongside Renée Zellweger as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002), a film {{adaptation of the}} Broadway musical {{of the same name}} from the director Rob Marshall. She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey her character's [...] "flamboyance" [...] and [...] "desperation" [...] through [...] "little looks and nuances". The film and her performance received critical acclaim. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer felt that the actress made [...] "a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess", and David Edelstein of Slate magazine wrote that she has [...] "a smoldering confidence that <b>takes</b> <b>your</b> mind off her not-always-fluid dancingalthough she's a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage" [...] and particularly praised her rendition of the song [...] "All That Jazz". Chicago earned [...] worldwide, and was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture. For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and nominations.|$|E
