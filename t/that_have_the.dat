3000|$|Since J is an (α,δ)-compatible ideal <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> IFP of a ring R, hence by Lemma  3.2, √(J) is an (α,δ)-compatible ideal <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> IFP of a ring R. Thus, √(J) is weak (α,δ)-skew Armendariz ideal.|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E

LEPR drops the bundle {{with the lowest}} delivery probability. In other words, LEPR drops <b>the</b> bundle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> lowest P. Lastly, HOP-COUNT drops <b>the</b> bundle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> greatest number of hops and forwards <b>the</b> bundle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> smallest number of hops. We also evaluated QM-EBRP against Optimal Global Knowledge (OGK), a scheme {{that is similar to}} [21] and [33]. In this policy, we assume that nodes are synchronized with a shared global memory to update bundle information such as the number of disseminated replicas. Accordingly, every node is instantly aware of the accurate number of disseminated replicas of each bundle in the network. This policy thus allows us to compare QM-EBRP against a theoretical scheme.|$|R
5|$|Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{values for}} Kettle Creek have been measured. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{is a method}} of {{determining}} water quality based {{on the presence of}} macroinvertebrate families and their tolerance to pollution. It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least polluted. Kettle Creek ranges from 4.61 to 2.54 with an average of 3.32. The EPT Index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera Index) has also been measured for the creek. It ranges from 10 to 25 with an average of 17. There are 285 vertebrate species <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to inhabit the Kettle Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Markov property, {{which means the}} next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process.

5|$|Over {{the last}} several years, HPMI has proven a number of {{technology}} concepts <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to narrow the gap between research and practical applications of nanotube-based materials. These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of nanotube membranes or buckypapers, production of nanotube composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation. HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).|$|E

5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E
