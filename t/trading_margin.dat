The {{study also found that}} market participation was inadequate as a result of endogenous and exogenous conditional probabilistic reasons. Efficient <b>trading</b> <b>margins</b> and effective credit availability positions were not realized. Price discreteness had a negative impact on returns, as trading prices and credit availability in each of the trading hours were inversely related. Trading risks, and hence losses, were not minimized by hedging positions. The monopoly power in the Nifty market was 8.9526. Given this monopoly power, returns were less elastic with respect to the existing <b>trading</b> <b>margins,</b> financial resources, and market microstructure (price discreteness) that were available for reinvestment. Therefore, before investing in derivatives (index futures), market investors should evaluate <b>trading</b> <b>margins,</b> credit availability positions, and price discreteness.

In the present study, the tick size effect was observed through the tick value, i.e., tick size multiplied by the Nifty contract size. Contract size again depended on the number of market lots and the market lot price. Hence, tick size effect on returns was examined through the number of market lots. The time of submission of limit orders was the proxy for a bid-ask bounce effect on returns. The effects of other market frictions (e.g., <b>trading</b> <b>margin,</b> credit availability) on Nifty returns, i.e., the closing prices compared to average money values of contracts, were examined.|$|E

A total of 1, 200 Cobb- 500 line male broilers were placed in a completely randomized design with four treatments and 10 replicates, with 30 animals each. The diets in each treatment were as follows: 1. COBB-VANTRESS (2009); 2. Commercial feed; 3. Rostagno et al. (2005); and 4. Rostagno et al. (2011). The following performance traits were evaluated: feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG), body weight (BW), feed conversion (FC) and productive efficiency index (PEI). The experiment ran while chickens were 1 to 21 and 1 to 42 days old. For the economic analysis, the diet cost and live weight price were considered when calculating the average cost of the diet (ADC) and the gross <b>trading</b> <b>margin</b> (TM). Analysis of variance was used to evaluate ADC and TM performance traits; diets means were compared with Tukey’s test. In the 1 to 21 day period, there was a higher FI and less efficient FC with diet 1 and more efficient PEI with diet 4. During the 1 to 42 day period, diets 1, 3 and 4 had the highest BW, WG and PEI.

Historical development of agricultural sector influenced the difference of Czechoslovakian and Polish agriculture. Despite the differences, governments of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland decided to provide public support for newly established producer groups after EU accession. Main aim of this analyses is to compare how money were provided to newly established producer groups in above mentioned countries and to assess efficiency of spend money. Main part of the theses {{is focused on}} measures provided during {{part of the first}} postaccession Programming Period 2004 when 2006. Between 2007 and 2013, support was provided only in Poland and Slovakia, the Czech Republic did not used the opportunity to open measure for new entities. Own analytical part is focused on measure evaluation through subject identification. Supported subjects were examined whether they follow main conditions of recognition or whether they fulfil main theoretical prerequisite for operation as marketing cooperative. Subject examination was based on own methodology that was developed on the bases of literature overview. Evaluation was based following indicators (i) share of marketed production on the total agricultural output of the country; (ii) market share on the relevant market and created value added. Results of the theses indicate, that part of supported producer groups were established solely in order to gain easy access to public money. Groups share on relevant market is negligible, goals of market concentration were not met. Groups value added is low. This fact is mainly caused by observed characteristics groups often does not own any investment assets, does not have any employees. After receiving last payment, groups were closed, transformed into other business activity or its ownership structure were changed In the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{efficient}} market hypothesis {{is a special}} case in finance. It explains only tiny fractions of observed phenomena. Perhaps its major contribution is a formal definition of an ideal market world, to which policy formulations may be directed and against which they can be measured. Indeed, {{it seems unlikely that}} the infirmities of market action ever will be so minuscule as to render the EMH more than a special case, though it may explain more in the future than it does now. However things evolve, during the evolutionary course the shackles of the EMH should be unloosed from corporate and investing culture. Part I presents behavioral finance as to how prices of stocks are formed?including a theoretical framework, empirical evidence, and psychological explanations. It integrates these materials into a model of market and investor behavior that {{can be used as a}} lens through which to analyze a wide variety of legal rules and policies bearing on market regulation and corporate governance. Part II is a series of prescriptions on the implications of this account relating to investor governance. It starts with a proposal to promote and expand investor education concerning the cognitive biases behavioral finance exposes. It proceeds to introduce and propose reforms in three critical areas of law and policy that this model impacts: (1) the market regulatory environment in which investors participate, including suitability and churning rules and policies relating to day <b>trading,</b> <b>margin</b> trading, and circuit breakers; (2) the legal duties of boards of directors in making capital allocation decisions such as equity offerings, dividend distributions and stock acquisitions; and (3) issues in corporate and securities litigation, principally the reliance requirement in securities fraud cases and the stock market exception to the appraisal remedy in cash out mergers. The {{efficient market}} idea turns out to be an aspiration worth pursuing, but one never likely to be realized. These proposals and prescriptions therefore operate both to push the reality toward the ideal and to deal with the gap that will persist. The article has a major public policy subtext too, at stake in the discussion of how prices are formed is the overarching question of capital allocation. Society is better off in terms of aggregate wealth when its resources are allocated to those best able to deploy them. Investors allocating capital based on rational calculation will produce that result, while those allocating based on sentiment will not. A word on methodology concludes the piece concerning where the piece fits in the bourgeoning legal literature drawing on behavioral social science. Throughout the intellectual history and genealogy of behavioral finance, legal scholars with a social science inclination have drawn on various strands of thought pioneered in these fields, importing the work of the cognitive psychologists, principally behavioral decision theory (which they call BDT). Concerns of the lead importers center on the usefulness of BDT to legal scholarship and policymaking generally include whether all it will do is furnish criticism of law and economics and fail to offer its own positive theories of law or normative prescriptions. Whatever power BDT has for legal scholarship in general, this Article should leave no doubt that it furnishes a positive theory of market behavior quite different than that of efficiency (imported and promoted by some law and economics devotees) and that this theory carries with it substantial normative implications for law and legal policy in the fields of securities and corporate law...|$|E

The proposed methodology is founded on the business statistics approach and tries to answer to the question “who sell what and to whom?”. The data collected from the enterprises, at a very detailed level of classification, provide a good representation of the “distributive channels ” (e. g. supermarkets, traditional grocery stores) but it needed an integration with information related to the economic destination of products (householders, enterprises, etc.) and to the different products sold by each commercial firm.
