They organized a powerpoint project, titled, The Miami Project, {{and began a}} series of presentations in their local offices at the Poynter Institute. Their colleagues were interested yet unenthusiastic about the project. In the spring of 2004, while preparing for an annual Online Leaders seminar at the Institute, they were asked to present it again. This time, they decided to present the story {{from the perspective of the}} future, as if it had already happened. They assembled the first version of the film late one night in Poynter's visual journalism lab, on an iMac G4 running Final Cut Pro. The narrative was met with enthusiasm by the conference participants, and they soon began revising and polishing their presentation, this time using Macromedia Flash. They kept presenting it, introducing the film dramatically – gliding into rooms wearing tin foil hats. They always followed the movie with the question: [...] "If this is what the year 2014 looks like, what are you going to do today <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> news organization doesn't get sidelined?

50|$|While punishments may be {{of limited}} value in {{consistently}} influencing rule-related behavior, non-punitive discipline techniques {{have been found to}} have greater impact on children who have begun to master their native language. Non-punitive discipline (also known as empathic discipline and positive discipline) is an approach to child-rearing that does not use any form of punishment. It is about loving guidance, and requires parents to have a strong relationship with their child so that the child responds to gentle guidance as opposed to threats and punishment. According to Dr. Laura Markham, the most effective discipline strategy is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> child wants to please you.|$|E

Having seen the film, he thought that it started off reasonably, but deceptively presented creationists as though they had reputations on a par with well credentialed experts, and as the film went on more standard creationism began to emerge.|$|E
50|$|Primordia has {{a typical}} point-and-click interface: a left mouse click to {{interact}} with objects, a right click to examine them. Every function needed is always available from a drop-down control panel that appears when you move the pointer {{to the top of}} the screen. Inventory items can be combined in the inventory UI and may be used on every hotspot and character. Crispin can be told {{to interact with}} objects, too. Crispin also serves as a hint-system blended in appropriately within the game in order to avoid breaking the fourth wall. As Horatio and Crispin wander about, a datapad automatically stores codes, passwords and information about the world. The datapad also contains a map which allows fast travel (whenever that's available) with one click to every known location. Conversations with other robots are handled in a multiple choice fashion.

But then when John (Corbett) and I recently sat down to do that interview (for the 10th anniversary edition), we laughed so hard through the whole thing. It made me think that it's time. He said, [...] "Come on, write something, will you?" [...] And I now think I will. We have such an easy chemistry together. And we have chemistry because we never 'did it.' That's the surefire way to kill chemistry in a scene. You have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> actors don't 'do it' off-screen.
