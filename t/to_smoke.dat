40|$|Cigarettes contain {{thousands}} of poisonous substances. Therefore, {{it is imperative}} that attempts be made to end unnecessary exposures <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoke,</b> and prevent unnecessary exposure <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>to</b> prevent suffering. The situation is even more dangerous in the case of Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) which contributes significantly to 'passive smoking. (see, Megazine, April 13, 1995). This is because the amount of chemicals/poisons found in ETS can range from twice to 50 times as much, compared with normal (mainstream) cigarette smoke. Some of these are as follows: Nicotine:It has twice the amount of ETS relative <b>to</b> "mainstream" <b>smoke.</b> 2 times Tar:It has two to five times the amount of ETS relaive <b>to</b> "mainstream" <b>smoke.</b> Carbon monoxide:It has five times the amount of ETS relative <b>to</b> "mainstream" <b>smoke.</b> Hydrogen cyanide:It has four to six times more ETS relative <b>to</b> "mainstream" <b>smoke.</b> Toluene:It has six to eight times more ETS relative <b>to</b> "mainstream" <b>smoke.</b> Nitrosamine (carcinogen) : It has 50 times the amount of ETS relative <b>to</b> "mainstream" <b>smoke...</b>|$|R

The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded.

40|$|BackgroundIn the past, {{studies have}} {{compared}} smokeless tobacco and non-tobacco users for {{the risk of}} various chronic diseases. The differences {{in the risk of}} chronic diseases between smokeless tobacco user and smokers have not been explored. The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the risk of chronic diseases among smokeless tobacco users compared to smokers. MethodsThe data were used from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave- 1, conducted in 2007 – 2008 in India. The study sample is the respondents who reported consuming any form of tobacco in last 1 [*]month. The total sample size was 4, 038 respondents. The odds ratio of chronic morbidities was estimated taking smokers as the reference category. ResultsThe odds ratios for (self-reported) diabetes, asthma, and hypertension were not significant for smokeless tobacco user compared <b>to</b> <b>smoked</b> tobacco users. The odds ratio of chronic lung diseases (CLDs) was significantly lower among smokeless tobacco users compared <b>to</b> <b>smoked</b> tobacco users. The odds ratio of hypertension (measured) combined with low education and belonging to lowest wealth quintiles were not significant for smokeless tobacco users compared <b>to</b> <b>smoked</b> tobacco users. Duration of the use of smokeless tobacco and quantity of use was found to have no significant relation with risk of chronic diseases as compared to smoking. ConclusionThis study did not find the significantly higher risk of chronic morbidities except for CLD for smokeless tobacco users compared <b>to</b> <b>smoked</b> tobacco users. The study suggests that the use of any form of tobacco may have a similar risk of chronic diseases...|$|R

5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> a herbal cigarette as it was illegal <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E

40|$|Background: Exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> from {{cigarettes}} is {{a public}} health hazard that is increasing globally and emerging in resource-poor nations where {{the health effects of}} secondhand smoke are less publicized in biomedical literatures, electronic and print media. As the global prevalence of cigarette smoking increases so does the health hazards and harm associated with secondhand smoke increases with implication for family and community health. Aim: The study was aimed at describing the epidemiology of exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> from cigarettes among innocent never smoked adult Nigerians in a primary care clinic of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive hospital-based study was carried out on 500 adult Nigerian patients in a primary care clinic in Nigeria. Data were collected using pretested, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaire containing information on relevant epidemiological variables. Exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> was defined as exposure <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> in a never smoked adult in the previous 1 year. Results: The prevalence of exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> was 45. 0 %. Exposures occur predominantly among males (56. 4 %), middle-aged adults (44. 0 %), outside home environment (72. 0), during the daytime (63. 6 %), and dry season (58. 7 %). The persons involved in the smoking were principally friends and passersby (65. 8 %). Exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> was associated with age (middle-aged adults) (P = 0. 036) and male gender (P = 0. 02). Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the variable epidemiology of exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke.</b> Tackling relevant epidemiological factors that predispose to exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> through programs and policies will facilitate appropriate public health action to safeguard the health of never smoked individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeCigarette smoking, {{exposure}} <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke,</b> and arsenic exposure {{are well}} known risk factors for developing urothelial carcinoma (UC). We investigated the combined effects of cigarette smoking, exposure <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke,</b> {{and the presence of}} urinary total arsenic on the risk of developing UC. MethodsWe conducted a hospital-based, case–control study involving 261  UC patients and 672 cancer-free control individuals between September 2002 and May 2009. ResultsIndividuals who had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime (ever smokers) and had a high urinary total arsenic level, had increased risks of developing UC (3. 20 -fold and 6. 45 -fold greater), respectively, compared to individuals who were never smokers and had a low urinary total arsenic level. Individuals who had high urinary total arsenic levels and had been exposed <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke,</b> and individuals with high urinary arsenic levels who had not been exposed <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke,</b> had increased chances (2. 71 -fold and 5. 00 -fold greater, respectively) of developing UC, compared to individuals who were not exposed <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> and had low urinary total arsenic levels. Ever smokers who had been exposed <b>to</b> secondhand <b>smoke</b> and had a high urinary total arsenic level had the greatest increased risk for developing UC (10. 82 -fold greater).
