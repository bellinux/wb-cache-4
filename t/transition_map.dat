25|$|Such a {{function}} {{is called a}} <b>transition</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{function}} {{is its own}} inverse and thus {{can be used in}} both directions. As the <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> is a smooth function, this atlas defines a smooth manifold.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} manifold, or Cω-manifold is {{a smooth}} manifold {{with the additional}} condition that each <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> is analytic: the Taylor expansion is absolutely convergent and equals the function on some open ball.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smoothness}} {{requirements on}} the transition functions can be weakened, {{so that we}} only require the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> to be k-times continuously differentiable; or strengthened, so that we require the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> to be real-analytic. Accordingly, this gives a [...] or (real-)analytic structure on the manifold rather than a smooth one. Similarly, we can define a complex structure by requiring the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> to be holomorphic.|$|R
25|$|The {{manifold}} {{is constructed}} by specifying an atlas, which is itself defined by <b>transition</b> <b>maps.</b> A {{point of the}} manifold is therefore an equivalence class of points which are mapped to each other by <b>transition</b> <b>maps.</b> Charts map equivalence classes to points of a single patch. There are usually strong demands on {{the consistency of the}} <b>transition</b> <b>maps.</b> For topological manifolds they are required to be homeomorphisms; if they are also diffeomorphisms, the resulting manifold is a differentiable manifold.|$|R
5000|$|A {{differentiable}} manifold is a topological manifold {{equipped with}} an equivalence class of atlases whose <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are all differentiable. More generally, a Ck-manifold is a topological manifold with an atlas whose <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are all k-times continuously differentiable.|$|R
25|$|Viewed using calculus, {{the circle}} {{transition}} function T {{is simply a}} function between open intervals, which gives a meaning to the statement that T is differentiable. The <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> T, and all the others, are differentiable on (0, 1); therefore, with this atlas the circle is a differentiable manifold. It is also smooth and analytic because the transition functions have these properties as well.|$|E
25|$|Charts in the atlases which {{specify the}} {{structure}} of manifolds and fiber bundles are partial functions. In the case of manifolds, the domain is the point set of the manifold. In the case of fiber bundles, the domain is the total space of the fiber bundle. In these applications, the most important construction is the <b>transition</b> <b>map,</b> which is the composite of one chart with the inverse of another. The initial classification of manifolds and fiber bundles is largely {{expressed in terms of}} constraints on these transition maps.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} with the <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> t = 1⁄s {{from the second}} half of the circle example. Start with two copies of the line. Use the coordinate s for the first copy, and t for the second copy. Now, glue both copies together by identifying the point t on the second copy with the point s = 1⁄t on the first copy (the points t = 0 and s = 0 are not identified with any point on the first and second copy, respectively). This gives a circle.|$|E
50|$|Such a map is a homeomorphism between open subsets of Rn. That is, {{coordinate}} charts {{agree on}} overlaps up to homeomorphism. Different types of manifolds {{can be defined}} by placing restrictions on types of <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> allowed. For example, for differentiable manifolds the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are required to be diffeomorphisms.|$|R
25|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} differentiable manifolds are smooth and analytic manifolds. For smooth manifolds the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are smooth, that is infinitely differentiable. Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds {{with the additional}} condition that the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are analytic (they can be expressed as power series). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>transition</b> <b>maps,</b> a G-bundle {{can be reduced}} {{if and only if}} the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> can be taken to have values in H.Note that the term {{reduction}} is misleading: it suggests that H is a subgroup of G, which is often the case, but need not be (for example for spin structures): it's properly called a lifting.|$|R
2500|$|The n-sphere Sn is a {{generalisation}} of {{the idea}} of a circle (1-sphere) and sphere (2-sphere) to higher dimensions. An n-sphere Sn can be constructed by gluing together two copies of Rn. The <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> between them is defined as ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{is called}} the <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> between the two copies of C — the {{so-called}} charts — glueing them together. Since the transition maps are holomorphic, they define a complex manifold, called the Riemann sphere. As a complex manifold of 1 complex dimension (i.e., 2 real dimensions), this is also called a Riemann surface.|$|E
2500|$|Either of [...] or [...] may be zero, but not both, so both charts {{are needed}} to cover the {{projective}} line. The <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> between these two charts is the multiplicative inverse. As it is an differentiable function, and even an analytic function (outside of zero), the real projective line is both a differentiable manifold and an analytic manifold.|$|E
50|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} differentiable manifolds are smooth and analytic manifolds. For smooth manifolds the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are smooth, that is infinitely differentiable. Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds {{with the additional}} condition that the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are analytic (they can be expressed as power series). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces.|$|R
25|$|One may {{construct}} an atlas for the tangent bundle consisting of charts based on , where U'α denotes {{one of the}} charts in the atlas for M. Each of these new charts is the tangent bundle for the charts U'α. The <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> on this atlas are defined from the <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> on the original manifold, and retain the original differentiability class.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the theorem with real {{coefficients}} features the de Rham cohomology with values in the orientation bundle. This is the flat real line bundle denoted , that is trivialized by coordinate charts of the manifold NM, with <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> {{the sign of the}} Jacobian determinant of the charts <b>transition</b> <b>maps.</b> As a flat line bundle, it has a de Rham cohomology, denoted by ...|$|R
2500|$|Many places {{will appear}} {{in more than one}} chart. [...] For example, a map of North America will likely include parts of South America and the Arctic circle. [...] These regions of the globe will be {{described}} in full in separate charts, which in turn will contain parts of North America. [...] There is a relation between adjacent charts, called a <b>transition</b> <b>map</b> that allows them to be consistently patched together to ...|$|E
2500|$|Poincaré's {{notion of}} a chain of {{manifolds}} is a precursor to the modern {{notion of a}}tlas. In particular, he considers two manifolds defined respectively as graphs of functions [...] and [...] If these manifolds overlap (a une partie commune), then he requires that the coordinates [...] depend continuously differentiably on the coordinates [...] and vice versa (...les [...] sont fonctions analytiques des [...] et inversement). In this way he introduces a precursor {{to the notion of}} a chart and of a <b>transition</b> <b>map.</b> Note that it is implicit in Analysis Situs that a manifold obtained as a 'chain' is a subset of Euclidean space.|$|E
2500|$|Charts in an atlas may overlap and {{a single}} point of a {{manifold}} may be represented in several charts. If two charts overlap, parts of them represent the same region of the manifold, just as a map of Europe and a map of Asia may both contain Moscow. [...] Given two overlapping charts, a transition function can be defined which goes from an open ball in Rn to the manifold {{and then back to}} another (or perhaps the same) open ball in Rn. [...] The resultant map, like the map T in the circle example above, is called a change of coordinates, a coordinate transformation, a transition function, or a <b>transition</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, an {{analytic}} manifold is a topological manifold with analytic <b>transition</b> <b>maps.</b> Every complex manifold is an analytic manifold.|$|R
40|$|In human {{reasoning}} and multi-modal information processing, the diagrams offer a visual clarity in examining spatial constraints. Special diagrams like <b>transitions</b> <b>maps</b> are introduced for assisting {{the elaboration of}} operational procedures and for helping the training of operators. Adding visual-logic weights like values, colors or level curves, the diagrams assist better in recognizing conditioned inferences and in elaborating correctly procedures. The <b>transitions</b> <b>maps</b> extend the Euler-Venn diagrams and concur to {{an explanation of the}} four-color theorem...|$|R

2500|$|Although a {{manifold}} locally resembles Euclidean space, {{meaning that}} every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic {{to an open}} subset of Euclidean space, globally it may not: manifolds in general are not homeomorphic to Euclidean space. [...] For example, {{the surface of the}} sphere is not homeomorphic to a Euclidean space, because (among other properties) it has the global topological property of compactness that Euclidean space lacks, but in a region it can be charted by means of map projections of the region into the Euclidean plane (in the context of manifolds they are called charts). [...] When a region appears in two neighbouring charts, the two representations do not coincide exactly and a transformation is needed to pass from one to the other, called a <b>transition</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{presentation}} of a topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to a linear space, by a collection (called an atlas) of homeomorphisms called charts. [...] The composition of one chart with the inverse of another chart is a function called a <b>transition</b> <b>map,</b> and defines a homeomorphism of an open subset of the linear space onto another open subset of the linear space. This formalizes the notion of [...] "patching together pieces of a space to make a manifold" [...] – the manifold produced also contains the data of how it has been patched together. However, different atlases (patchings) may produce [...] "the same" [...] manifold; a manifold does not come with a preferred atlas. [...] And, thus, one defines a topological manifold to be a space as above with an equivalence class of atlases, where one defines equivalence of atlases below.|$|E

2500|$|Every topological {{manifold}} has an atlas. A Ck-atlas is an atlas whose <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are Ck. A topological manifold has a C0-atlas and {{in general}} a Ck-manifold has a Ck-atlas. A continuous atlas is a C0 atlas, a smooth atlas is a C∞ atlas and an analytic atlas is a Cω atlas. If the atlas is at least C1, it is also called a differential structure or differentiable structure. [...] A holomorphic atlas is an atlas whose underlying Euclidean space is defined on the complex field and whose <b>transition</b> <b>maps</b> are biholomorphic.|$|R
