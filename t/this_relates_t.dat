40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{efficiently}} drives {{proliferation of}} human primary B cells in vitro, a process relevant for human {{diseases such as}} infectious mononucleosis and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Human B-cell proliferation is also driven by ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), notably viral or bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, which triggers TLR 9. Here we quantitatively investigated how TLR stimuli influence EBV-driven B-cell proliferation and expression of effector molecules. CpG DNA syner-gistically increased EBV-driven proliferation and transformation, T-cell costimulatory molecules, and early production of interleukin- 6. CpG DNA alone activated only memory B cells, but CpG DNA enhanced EBV-mediated transformation of both memory and naive B cells. Ligands for TLR 2 or TLR 7 / 8 or whole bacteria had a weaker but still superadditive effect on B-cell transformation. Additionally, CpG DNA facilitated the release of transforming virus by established EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines. These {{results suggest that the}} proliferation of EBV-infected B cells and their capability to interact with immune effector cells may be directly influenced by components of bacteria or other microbes present at the site of infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus, is a very successful infectious agent: it establishes and maintains latent infection in 95 % of human beings worldwide. <b>This</b> success is <b>related</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major professor) ^r^- 7 ^ The {{problem of}} stream pollution lias been {{greatly influenced by}} wastes arising from fruit and vegetable canneries. Of the many agricultural products processed in these canneries, red beets (Beta vulgaris) constitute a major problem {{not only because of}} their organic content but also because of their highly colored nature. This beet color may pass through subsequent waste treatment processes, enter a receiving stream and impart an undesirable color to the water. Many canneries discharge their waste to the city sewers and the screening and primary treatment orocesses of sewage treatment plants give only slight color reductions. It is toe secondary treat ment processes which afford a means of removing beet waste color. This study presents the ability of the activated sludge process to remove beet color from a waste and <b>relates</b> <b>this</b> ability <b>t...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{study has}} shown the {{antiarrhythmic}} effects of carvedilol on isolated rat hearts, but {{little is known about}} the mechanism of this protective action. This article examines the inhibitory effect of carvedilol against arrhythmias induced by reperfusion in anesthetized rats. In addition, the results are compared with those with propranolol, super-oxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase, and a combination of both in order to elucidate the mechanism of the protective actions. Methods and Materials: Ninety percent of the rats in the control group showed lethal ventricular fibrillation (VF). Carvedilol at the doses of 0. 03, 0. 1, and 0. 3 mg/kg significantly reduced the incidence of lethal VF to 0 %, 0 %, and 10 %, respectively (P <. 05). In contrast, propranolol at the doses of 0. 3, 1. 0, and 3. 0 mg/kg and SOD (35, 000 units/kg) plus catalase (400, 000 units/kg) did not reduce the incidence of lethal VF (80 %, 60 %, 70 %, and 70 %, respectively). However, administration of a combination of propranolol (1. 0 mg/kg) and SOD plus catalase completely inhibited the occurrence of lethal VF to 0 % (P <. 05). Conclusion: These results indicate that carvedilol has the inhibitory effect against reperfusion arrhythmias in rats and suggest that the mechanism of action of <b>this</b> compound is <b>related</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R

At the end an annotated bibliography has been supplied. Conventions and notations. I adhered to {{the historical development of}} T E X et cetera, and did not order the tools with respect to perceived importance. The latter is a matter of taste and definitely time-dependent. The Contents list is not a one-to-one mapping of the section titles. It is used to stress the main items and their treatment within a logical hierarchy. I clustered some section titles and subsection titles, whenever convenient, to enhance readability. The aim was to convey the contents and not so much the form, to paraphrase Marvin Minsky. Because it is a `helicopter' view I need to refer to other work. This has been done a little loose via the name of the (first) author and the title, or keywords form the title. The reader can easily spot from the supplied list of references which work is hinted at. Just start by the author name and look for the matching title. I also did not bother about traditions which require that book titles are set in italics or so. In my opinion to find out whether it is a book, a report or a journal article follows easily from the ISBN number if provided, respectively the journal name.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} “second {{parameter}} ” pair of globular clusters NGC 288 /NGC 362 {{on the basis}} of theoretical models for red giant branch (RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) stars. The results of the most extensive set of RGB/HB simulations computed so far for these clusters are presented for two different metallicities. Using several different analytical mass loss formulae for RGB stars, we derive relative “HB morphology ages. ” We compare them with the relative main-sequence turnoff ages derived by application of the “bridge test ” by Bellazzini et al. (2001), who found that NGC 288 is 2 ± 1 Gyr older than NGC 362. We find that adoption of a higher metallicity ([Fe/H] ≈ − 1. 2), as favored by the Carretta & Gratton metallicity scale, makes age a much more plausible second parameter candidate for this pair than is the case when a lower metallicity ([Fe/H] ≈ − 1. 5), closer to the Zinn & West scale, is adopted. However, while the different HB morphology of these two clusters can be reproduced by canonical HB models with [Fe/H] ≈ − 1. 2 and an age difference of 2 Gyr, this explanation is not without difficulty. In particular, we confirm previous suggestions that canonical models are unable to reproduce the detailed HB morphology of NGC 288 at its red end, for as yet unknown reasons. Finally, we show that the mass dispersion on the HB of NGC 362 is substantially larger than for NGC 288, and suggest that there is a correlation between the mass dispersion on the HB phase and the central density of globular clusters. <b>This</b> is presumably <b>related</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
