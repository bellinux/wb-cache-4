50|$|As adults, all {{males have}} paired {{turquoise}} patches of {{skin on the}} abdomen; females lack this abdominal coloration. Male ornate <b>tree</b> <b>lizards</b> are found {{in a variety of}} colors. While not all populations contain {{more than one or two}} colors, 9 color types have been documented within U. ornatus. A population documented in Verde River, Arizona, has two types of coloration patterns among male <b>tree</b> <b>lizards</b> that account for 45% of all males. The first is characterized by a blue spot in the center of a larger orange patch on the throat fan ("dewlap"). The second has a solid orange throat fan ("dewlap"). The orange-blue males are more aggressive and defend territories that can include up to four females. The orange males have longer, leaner body types and are much less aggressive. Orange males can be nomadic during dry years, and during rainy years tend to occupy small territories.|$|R

40|$|Exposure {{to stress}} can aVect an organism’s {{partitioning}} of resources among immune function and other organismal functions. How-ever, measuring immune function is often diYcult. Recent {{studies show that}} the rate of cutaneous wound healing in laboratory rodents is a simple, integrated measure of stress-sensitive immune function. We investigated the use of this technique in <b>tree</b> <b>lizards</b> to test the hypotheses (1) that stress compromises wound healing and (2) that this eVect is at least partially mediated by corticosterone. Laboratory-housed male <b>tree</b> <b>lizards</b> randomly assigned to the experimental and control treatment groups received a 3. 5 mm cutaneous biopsy on the dorsal surface of the pelvis. Experimental group males were restrained in cloth bags for 60 min every day for 21 days during the healing proWle, whereas control males were left in their cages. Wound sizes were measured every other day by image analysis. Control animals healed faster than stressed animals. The diVerence in wound surface area between the groups was most pronounced early in the healing proWle. Stressed animals also had higher corticosterone levels and corticosterone was negatively correlated with healing rate in the stressed animals. These observations support both hypotheses that stress compromises healing and that corticosterone may act to mediate the eVects of stress...|$|R

Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species.

5000|$|The {{species is}} diurnal, active during the daytime. [...] The level of {{activity}} exhibited is at least partially dependent {{on the presence of}} sunlight. Individuals emerge once the sun comes out, and will remain active unless cloud cover reduces sunlight. The approximate times of activity are from 8:30am until 5:00pm and males appear to emerge from holes in trees earlier than females and juveniles. Upon emerging from the <b>tree</b> <b>lizards</b> will bask in the sun to raise their body temperature until activity body temperatures are reached. When approached by humans or startled the lizards will either run into their holes to hide or run out on limbs of the tree to avoid whatever startled them.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{conceptual}} {{recognition that}} indirect effects initiated by large herbivores {{are likely to}} have profound impacts on ecological community structure and function, the existing literature on indirect effects focuses largely on the role of predators. As a result, we know neither the frequency and extent of herbivore-initiated indirect effects nor the mechanisms that regulate their strength. We examined the effects of ungulates on taxa (plants, arthropods, and an insectivorous lizard) representing several trophic levels, using a series of large, long-term, ungulate-exclusion plots that span a landscape-scale productivity gradient in an African savanna. At each of six sites, <b>lizards,</b> <b>trees,</b> and the numerically dominant order of arthropods (Coleoptera) were more abundant in the absence of ungulates. The effect of ungulates on arthropods was mediated by herbaceous vegetation cover. The effect on lizards was simultaneously mediated by both <b>tree</b> density (<b>lizard</b> microhabitat) and arthropod abundance (lizard food). The magnitudes of the experimental effects on all response variables (<b>trees,</b> arthropods, and <b>lizards)</b> were negatively correlated with two distinct measures of primary productivity. These results demonstrate strong cascading effects of ungulates, both trophic and nontrophic, and support the hypothesis that productivity regulates the strength of these effects. Hence, the strongest indirect effects (and thus, the greatest risks to ecosystem integrity after large mammals are extirpated) are likely to occur in low-productivity habitats...|$|R
