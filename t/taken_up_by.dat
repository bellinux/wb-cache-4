5|$|In 1237, Óláfr {{died and}} was succeeded by his elder son, Haraldr, who later drowned in 1248. The kingship was then <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> his brother, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson. After a reign of only weeks, Rǫgnvaldr was slain and the kingship was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Haraldr Guðrøðarson, a {{descendant}} of Óláfr's half-brother and deadly rival, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. After a short reign, this Haraldr was removed from power by his overlord, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway. In Haraldr's absence, Magnús and a relation of his, Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, King in the Isles, unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Mann. A few years later, Magnús successfully made {{his return to the}} island and was proclaimed king.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Israelites purely {{as a religious}} mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as {{a rite of passage}} into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> cells {{and must be}} broken into their smaller units {{before they can be}} used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much {{time and effort to}} provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or seakeeping.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} Land Use Survey by the Office for National Statistics in 2005 {{noted that}} the local authority area of Bournemouth had the third highest proportion of land <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> domestic gardens, 34.6%, of the 326 districts in England; narrowly less than the London Boroughs of Harrow and Sutton at the time with 34.7% and 35.1%.|$|E

In 1946, following another drought, Fraser moved the homestead again, to its present location. He abandoned the property in 1957.|$|R

5|$|The {{domestic}} and industrial waste dumped on Chat Moss resulted in {{very high levels}} of heavy metals such as lead and copper in the soil, raising concerns that crops grown there may pose a health risk. The high pH of the peaty soil limits the mobility of the metals however, and prevents them being <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> crops.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of {{drug-resistant}} Plasmodium parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins. Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{health is}} an issue which has been <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> many feminists, {{especially}} where reproductive health is concerned and the international women's movement was responsible {{for much of the}} adoption of agendas to improve women's health.|$|E

50|$|From then on, rugby in India, {{lingered on}} {{at a very}} low key. Part {{of the reason for}} this was that the British {{preferred}} to play apart from their colonial subjects, leading to a low <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the local population. Another reason was the climate, which meant that games would frequently have to be played in the evenings or early morning, which meant that it was not too popular with the colonists themselves.|$|R
5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany had been <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence.

5|$|Aylmer Road is a {{very short}} stretch of road, running west for {{less than half a}} mile between the {{junction}} with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet.

The road is named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, VC KCB, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> MPs George Galloway and Andrew Hunter and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of The Guardian. Allison {{became one of}} the campaign's patrons. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police {{gathered}} outside the house before shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Bamber was guilty. In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related to the case, in the interests of transparency.|$|E
5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to be <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E

His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.|$|E
