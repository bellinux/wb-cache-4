2500|$|It is {{not clear}} when the first Windsor Chairs were made. It is known that, {{as early as the}} 16th century, [...] wheelwrights started coping out chair {{spindles}} in the same way <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>wheel</b> spokes. The design was probably a development of West Country, Welsh and Irish 'stick-back' chairs, but the evidence on origin is not certain. It is thought that the first Windsor chair made its appearance in the county of Buckinghamshire, where the main centre of production eventually moved to High Wycombe. The first Windsors were of the comb-back variety. By the 18th century steam-bending was being used to produce the characteristic [...] "bow" [...] of the Windsor chair. [...] The first chairs made this way were shipped to London from the market town of Windsor, Berkshire in 1724. There is speculation that the chair derives its name from the town of Windsor, which became the centre for the trade between the producers and the London dealers. Thus the name [...] "Windsor Chair" [...] is more about the style of chair than where it was made, with many diverse forms of Windsor chair being made worldwide.|$|R
