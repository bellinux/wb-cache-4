The film was also released as The Mysterious Satellite in some areas. It was shown in the U.S. by American International Television later in the 1960s as Warning From Space.|$|E
5|$|Domestic competition, however, eclipsed Phonofilm. By September 1925, De Forest and Case's working {{arrangement}} {{had fallen}} through. The following July, Case joined Fox Film, Hollywood's third largest studio, to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed by Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name Movietone, thus {{became the first}} viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, <b>though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage. In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film.|$|E

For example, the Leopard 2 {{armed with the}} 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Egypt had manufactured 700–800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005, and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks; their M256 main guns (the US version of the L/44) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal. The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia, while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The American license-built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems {{as part of the}} M60-2000 Main Battle Tank which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a reduced cost, <b>though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> has not yet found a buyer.|$|E

5|$|Iowan resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. <b>Though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Iowan continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal.	For {{a time in}} the early 1920s, Iowan was chartered to the United American Line.

Later that same month, on 29 May, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line cargo ship Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon. Seven men aboard Welsh Prince were killed and three were injured in the crash and subsequent fire.|$|E
5|$|Kentuckian resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. <b>Though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Kentuckian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal {{with a few}} incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, Kentuckian was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker Los Alamos near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. Kentuckian had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port bilge keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in Kentuckians number two cargo hold, {{which resulted in the}} delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. Kentuckian made her way to Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo.|$|E

5|$|Kudos Film and Television {{developed}} Spooks after releasing Channel 4 medical drama Psychos in 1999, <b>though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> initially faced friction {{from television}} networks which saw no potential in a post-Cold War spy show.

Four episodes were being written when the September 11 attacks took place, and the some scenes were rewritten {{to take the}} event into account to show the audience Spooks's goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former intelligence officers from the Security Service, KGB and Central Intelligence Agency. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} indigenous rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force. In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. <b>Though</b> <b>the</b> <b>Company</b> made good on most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his own capital at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the subsequent submission of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E
5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, <b>though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E

5|$|Starting with Final Fantasy III, Square began {{publishing}} guide {{books for}} its games which traditionally include additional content such as developer interviews and expanded plot and setting information. Studio BentStuff {{wrote the first}} Ultimania book for Final Fantasy VIII in 1999, <b>though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had been contracted to write Final Fantasy VII True Script Dissection for the previous game. Since then, Ultimania books have been written for every major Final Fantasy title, including Battle Ultimania, Scenario Ultimania, and Ultimania Omega editions for some games. Square experimented with online content delivery with Final Fantasy IX Online Ultimania, but the move was criticized for forcing customers to buy a print guide while releasing {{most of the information}} online. Another online Ultimania was planned for Final Fantasy XI, but it was dropped during development. Square Enix has produced expanded editions to some books, such as Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania Revised Edition. In addition to the Ultimania series, Square Enix also publishes an Official Complete Guide series of guide books.|$|E
5|$|The company {{known today}} as Burger King itself began as a franchise; the {{predecessor}} of the modern company was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. The original founders and owners, Kieth J. Kramer and Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around {{a piece of equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, Kramer and Burns required all of their franchises to carry the device. The rights to open stores in Miami, Florida, belonged to two businessmen named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton and their company: South Florida Restaurants, Inc. Due to operational issues with the Insta-Broiler, in 1954 McLamore and Edgarton made the decision to replace the Insta-Broiler with a mechanized gas grill they called a flame broiler. Even <b>though</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had rapidly expanded throughout the state until its operations totaled more than 40 locations in 1955, the original Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties and the pair of McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain and rechristened the company as Burger King of Miami.|$|E
