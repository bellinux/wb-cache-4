5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E
5|$|The first British {{furnaces}} {{outside the}} Weald {{appeared during the}} 1550s, and many {{were built in the}} remainder of that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it in some more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew. The Backbarrow blast furnace built in Cumbria in 1711 has been described as the first efficient example.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{spent the}} summer of 1892 at his Bar Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in the presidential {{campaign}} other <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a single speech in New York in October. Harrison was defeated soundly in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine returned to Washington at the close of 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine’s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.|$|E

The designer does this because it is usually more practical to make a dam of material essentially just piled up <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the material stick together against vertical tension.|$|E
25|$|Goodall {{had always}} been passionate about animals and Africa, which {{brought her to the}} farm of a friend in the Kenya {{highlands}} in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining his wife Mary Leakey's approval, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.|$|E

500|$|Leigh {{explained}} that she played [...] "as many different parts as possible" [...] {{in an attempt to}} learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, [...] "It's much easier to make people cry <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them laugh." ...|$|E

Naturally, the Great Wall of China came under attack {{as a symbol of}} the past. For example, an influential writer of this period, Lu Xun, harshly criticized the [...] "mighty and accursed Great Wall" [...] in a short essay: [...] "In reality, it has never served any purpose <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> countless workers labour to death in vain... surrounds everyone." ...|$|E

He added that he [...] "should know better <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> political statements". Some members of the U.S. Congress, the NBA and human rights groups suggested that Rodman had become a public relations stunt for the North Korean government.

500|$|Patel and Menon, {{who were}} charged with the actual job of {{negotiating}} with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru. The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on 5 July 1947 made no threats. Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress' intentions, and invited them to join independent India [...] "to make laws sitting together as friends <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> treaties as aliens". He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states. Unlike the Political Department of the British Government, {{it would not be}} an instrument of paramountcy, but a medium whereby business could be conducted between the states and India as equals.|$|E
500|$|Usher toured {{fourteen}} {{cities in}} North America, coining the trip One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour. Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008. The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special like this for their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull that off, I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up close and personal <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E

500|$|When Metamorphosis Alpha was updated and {{expanded}} into Gamma World, {{it seemed the}} right time for Gygax to reintroduce Expedition to the Barrier Peaks to the public. Said Gygax, [...] "What could be more logical <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> available a scenario which blends the two role playing approaches into a single form?" [...] Gygax updated the scenario to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) rules, hoping it could serve as a primer on how to integrate science into one's fantasy role playing game. In 1980, the updated version was published as Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. At the time of Expedition to the Barrier Peakss release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The 32-page adventure bears the code S3 ("S" [...] for [...] "special"). The module included a 36-page book and a 32-page book, with two outer folders; {{it was one of the}} first deluxe scenario modules, and included a book of illustrations intended to be shown to the players during the game, including four color paintings. This module was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987. Although an article on the Wizards.com web site did provide a conversion to Future Tech, the adventure never received an official sequel and was not updated for the D version 3.5 rules (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons & Dragons and releases a new version). [...] It was made into a novel of the same name by Roland J. Green for the Greyhawk Classics series. The adventure has also been referenced in the Nodwick comic series. Unlike the other S series adventures, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks was not included in the Dungeon Survival Guide by author Bill Slavicsek because to him it was a [...] "wonderful adventure", but not [...] "a D adventure. Once you add ray guns and power armor to the game, you have a fundamentally different experience." [...] Other products that have introduced futuristic elements into D include the adventure City of the Gods (1987) and the novel Tale of the Comet (1997).|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E
