In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and how to set up a system to create one, and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E

500|$|Uncle David {{was filmed}} over {{five days in}} October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey, a {{location}} chosen for its proximity to London. Hoyle commented that the profusion of barbed wire fences there made him wonder if they were [...] "keeping people out or keeping people in?". Reich {{said that he had}} been [...] "obsessed" [...] with Sheppey, a place he had considered [...] "a truly Godforsaken wasteland" [...] since working on a television show there ten years previously. He remarked that the [...] "trailer trash setting" [...] of the film was influenced by Harmony Korine's Gummo (1997) and John Waters' Female Trouble (1974). He also said that the filming budget of under £1000 was a homage to [...] "the spirit of John Waters." [...] All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey, and to film a scene in a local cafe, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> and asked the proprietors if they could shoot there. Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a horror film, during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew's activities.|$|E

500|$|Part One has a 67% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, while Part Two has an 80% rating. Scott Foundas of the LA Weekly proclaimed Che [...] "nothing if not {{the movie}} of the year". In his review for the Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, [...] "At its best, Che is both action film and ongoing argument. Each new camera setup seeks to {{introduce}} a specific idea—about Che or his situation—and every choreographed battle sequence {{is a sort of}} algorithm where the camera attempts to inscribe the event that is being enacted". Hoberman compared Soderbergh's directing style and [...] "non-personalized" [...] historical approach on the film to Otto Preminger's observational use of the moving camera, or one of Roberto Rossellini's [...] "serene" [...] documentaries. Armond White, in his review for the New York Press, wrote, [...] "Out-perversing Gus Van Sant's Milk, Soderbergh makes a four-hour-plus biopic about a historical figure without providing a glimmer of charm or narrative coherence". In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott writes, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh once again offers a master class in filmmaking. As history, though, Che is finally not epic but romance. It takes great care to be true to the factual record, but it is, nonetheless, a fairy tale". Sheri Linden, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "in this flawed work of austere beauty, the logistics of war and the language of revolution give way to something greater, a struggle that may be defined by politics but can't be contained by it". In her review for the Washington Post, Ann Hornaday wrote, [...] "The best way to encounter Che, is to let go of words like 'film' and 'movie', words that somehow seem inadequate to the task of describing such a mesmerizing, fully immersive cinematic experience. By the end of Che, viewers will likely emerge as if from a trance, with indelibly vivid, if not more ambivalent feelings about Guevara, than the bumper-sticker image <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> with".|$|E

2500|$|Bao Tong, Zhao Ziyang's aide, was {{the highest-ranking}} {{official}} to be formally {{charged with a}} crime in connection with 1989 demonstrations. He was convicted in 1992 of [...] "revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing" [...] and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to [...] "deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests. More than 30,000 communist officers were deployed to assess 'political reliability' of more than one million government officials. The authorities arrested tens if not {{hundreds of thousands of people}} across the country. Some were seized in broad daylight while <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the street; others were arrested at night. Many were jailed or sent to labor camps. They were often denied access to see their families and often put in cells so crowded that not everyone had space to sleep. Dissidents shared cells with murderers and rapists, and torture was not uncommon.|$|E
