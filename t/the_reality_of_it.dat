500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Stenson had decided to quit the serial to pursue a career in musical theatre. She deemed it [...] "one of the most difficult decisions [...] ever made", stating that Hollyoaks had been her [...] "dream job" [...] and that she would miss her friends in the cast and crew. She made the decision to resign around June 2009, but was convinced by then-producer Lucy Allan to play out a long exit storyline, which concluded filming in September 2010. Before filming her final scenes, Stenson secured her first West End role. Though she had previously felt ready to leave the series, when the time came, she was upset because she felt <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She called her final scenes [...] "really sad and emotional", and stated that while she had not had any input in Steph's exit, she was happy with it.|$|E

2500|$|This apprenticeship... {{became a}} part of [...] how things were recorded. I started to learn {{microphone}} placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room... And so bit by bit I was learning really how not to record.|$|E

I was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again, playing it, but not sounding it, with her right hand.|$|E

60|$|Bidwell {{was ruled}} by her clear and {{sensible}} words, and rode {{away into the}} clear dark of the summer's night with a feeling {{that it was all}} a dream--a vision such as he had often had while prospecting in the mountains; but, as day came on and he looked back upon the red hole he had made in the green hillside, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all came to pinch his heart and make him gasp. His storehouse, his well of golden waters, was unguarded, and open to the view of any one who should chance to look that way. He beat his old mule to a gallop in the frenzy of the moment.|$|E
60|$|Karl Albert, {{now at the}} top-gallant of his hopes: homaged Archduke of Upper Austria, homaged King of Bohemia, {{declared}} Kaiser of the German Nation,--is the highest-titled mortal going: and, poor soul, it is tragical, once more, {{to think}} what <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was for him. Ejection from house and home; into difficulty, poverty, despair; life in furnished lodgings, which he could not pay;--and at last heart-break, no refuge for him but in the grave. All which is mercifully hidden at present; so {{that he seems to}} himself a man at the top-gallant of his wishes; and lives pleasantly, among his friends, with a halo round his head to his own foolish sense and theirs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s current defence {{strategy}} does not correspond with <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> 2 ̆ 7 s security situation. The {{plan for the}} modernisation of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) is focused on expensive maritime and air capabilities for conflicts that the ADF couldn’t fight alone. Consequently, the ADF is exposed with an atrophying ground force and expeditionary capability for the low-level regional operations in which it will be most likely to engage. The ANZUS alliance is emerging as the cornerstone alliance for stability in the Asia-Pacific region but the US must understand the implications Australian defence planning {{will have on the}} future alliance.

60|$|The {{object of}} {{publishing}} these letters is, therefore, {{to give to}} those who are true-hearted and honest the same agreeable picture of life and manners which met the writer's own, eyes. She had in view a wide circle of friends throughout her own country, between whose hearts and her own there has been an acquaintance and sympathy of years, and who, loving excellence, and feeling <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in themselves, are sincerely pleased to have their sphere of hopefulness and charity enlarged. For such this is written; and if those who are not such begin to read, let them treat the book as a letter not addressed to them, which, having opened by mistake, they close and pass to the true owner.|$|E
6000|$|This {{made new}} {{difficulty}} for Ptolemy's friends. They attempted, at first, to evade this inspired injunction by denying <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> There {{was no such}} passage to be found, they said. It was all an invention of their enemies. This point {{seems to have been}} overruled, and then they attempted to give the passage some other than the obvious interpretation. Finally they maintained that, although it prohibited their furnishing Ptolemy himself with troops, it did not forbid their sending an armed force into Egypt under leaders of their own. That they could certainly do; and then, when the rebellion was suppressed, and Berenice's government overthrown, they could invite Ptolemy to return to his kingdom and resume his crown in a peaceful manner. This, they alleged, would not be [...] "furnishing him with troops," [...] and, of course would not be disobeying the oracle.|$|E
6000|$|This enthusiasm, this stern {{thirst for}} adventure, wilted under the sultry August sun {{and did not}} last above one hour. One poor little hour--and then we were ashamed that we had [...] "gushed" [...] so. The poetry was all in the anticipation--there is none in the reality. Imagine a vast, waveless ocean {{stricken}} dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn waste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude that belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like a bug through {{the midst of this}} shoreless level, and sending up tumbled volumes of dust {{as if it were a}} bug that went by steam; imagine this aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the shore still as far away as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color; imagine ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes.

25|$|In his {{analysis}} of the new art movement, Apollinaire makes a distinction between four different types of Cubism; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, Scientific Cubism, is the art of painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> vision, but from <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. <b>It</b> is <b>the</b> tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.|$|R
60|$|He used to {{tell his}} story to every {{stranger}} that arrived at Mr. Doolittle's hotel. He was observed, at first, to vary on some points every time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighborhood, but knew it by heart. Some always pretended to doubt <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and insisted that Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point on which he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost universally gave it full credit. Even to this day, they never hear a thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins; and it is a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out of Rip Van Winkle's flagon.|$|E
60|$|And so it went, verses new and old, verses without end, all in {{glorification of}} the {{succulent}} shellfish of Carmel. Saxon's enjoyment was keen, almost ecstatic, {{and she had}} difficulty in convincing herself of <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all. It seemed like some fairy tale or book story come true. Again, it seemed more like a stage, and these the actors, she and Billy having blundered into the scene in some incomprehensible way. Much of wit she sensed which she did not understand. Much she did understand. And she was aware that brains were playing as {{she had never seen}} brains play before. The puritan streak in her training was astonished and shocked by some of the broadness; but she refused to sit in judgment. They SEEMED good, these light-hearted young people; they certainly were not rough or gross as were many of the crowds she had been with on Sunday picnics. None of the men got drunk, although there were cocktails in vacuum bottles and red wine in a huge demijohn.|$|E
6000|$|But no visions {{have been}} recorded. It {{is true that}} certain stories of alleged visions have been {{circulated}} {{during the last few}} years. One, very pretty and touching, is of a child from the London slums who saw things invisible to others. This was one of the children of the very poor, who are taken in summer and planted all about England in cottages to have a week or a fortnight of country air and sunshine. Taken to Stonehenge, she had a vision of a great gathering of people, and so real did they seem that she believed in <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all, and so beautiful did they appear to her that she was reluctant to leave, and begged to be taken back to see it all again. Unfortunately it is not true. A full and careful inquiry has been made into the story, of which there are several versions, and its origin traced to a little story-telling Wiltshire boy who had read or heard of the white-robed priests of the ancient days at [...] "The Stones," [...] and who just to astonish other little boys naughtily pretended that he had seen it all himself! ...|$|E

40|$|Jacques Hamel, Interdisciplinarity : The Fiction of Scientific Research and <b>the</b> <b>Reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Its</b> Contemporary Management Interdisciplinarity in {{the social}} sciences, and {{especially}} in sociology, poses a number of questions. What is interdisciplinarity in relation to multidisciplinarity, to transdisciplinarity and to pluridisciplinarity ? Is interdisciplinarity derived from the definition of an object of study ? Can interdisciplinarity be achieved through the mediation of theory ? Does interdisciplinarity come from a methodology or a method ? Is interdisciplinarity revealed in the transition from explanation to action ? In the light of such questions, interdisciplinarity is a "theory" of theories of philosophical knowledge capable of explaining movements from one discipline to another, from one field of knowledge to another.

60|$|Well, Dolly, I {{suppose you}} will {{think it was}} pretty hard for those people, and when I got over my temper I confess that I felt sorry for the two men, and for the young girl whom the Altrurians would not call Lady Moors, but {{addressed}} by her Christian name, as they did each of the American party {{in his or her}} turn; even Mrs. Thrall had to answer to Rebecca. They were all rather bewildered, and so were the butler and the footmen, and the chef and his helpers, and the ladies' maids. These were even more shocked than those they considered their betters, and I quite took to my affections Lord Moors' man Robert, who was in an awe-stricken way trying to get some light from me on the situation. He contributed as much as any one to bring about a peaceful submission to the inevitable, for he had been a near witness of {{what had happened to the}} crew when they attempted their rebellion to the authorities; but he did not profess to understand the matter, and from time to time he seemed to question <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

And {{so long as}} {{you have}} the fire of the heart within you, and know <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> you need to be under no alarm as to the {{possibility}} of its chemical or mechanical analysis. The philosophers are very humorous in their ecstasy of hope about it; but the real interest of their discoveries in this direction is very small to humankind. It is quite true that the tympanum of the ear vibrates under sound, and that {{the surface of the water}} in a ditch vibrates too; but the ditch hears nothing for all that; and my hearing is still to me as blessed a mystery as ever, and the interval between the ditch and me quite as great. If the trembling sound in my ears was once of the marriage-bell which began my happiness, and is now of the passing-bell which ends it, the difference between those two sounds to me cannot be counted by the number of concussions. There have been some curious speculations lately as to the conveyance of mental consciousness by [...] "brain-waves." [...] What does it matter how it is conveyed? The consciousness itself is not a wave. It may be accompanied here or there by any quantity of quivers and shakes, up or down, of anything you can find in the universe that is shakable-- what is that to me? My friend is dead, and my--according to modern views --vibratory sorrow is not one whit less, or less mysterious, to me, than my old quiet one.|$|E
6000|$|But {{when the}} little sister herself takes it in hand, to measure things outside of us with, the joints shoot out in an amazing manner: the four-square walls even of {{celestial}} cities being measurable enough by that reed; and the way pointed to them, though only to be followed, or even seen, in the dim starlight shed down from worlds amidst {{which there is no}} name of Measure any more, though <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> always. For, indeed, to all true modesty the necessary business is not inlook, but outlook, and especially uplook: it is only her sister Shamefacedness, who is known by the drooping lashes--Modesty, quite otherwise, by her large eyes full of wonder; for she never contemns herself, nor is ashamed of herself, but forgets herself--at least until she has done something worth memory. It is easy to peep and potter about one's own deficiencies in a quiet immodest discontent; but Modesty is so pleased with other people's doings, that she has no leisure to lament her own: and thus, knowing the fresh feeling of contentment, unstained with thought of self, she does not fear being pleased, when there is cause, with her own rightness, as with another's, as with another's, saying calmly, [...] "Be it mine or yours, or whose else's it may, it is no matter; this also is well." [...] But the right to say such a thing depends on continual reverence and manifold sense of failure. If you have known yourself to have failed, you may trust, when it comes, the strange consciousness of success; if you have faithfully loved the noble work of others, you need not fear to speak with respect of things duly done, of your own.|$|E
