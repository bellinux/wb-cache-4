Some players prefer <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> from <b>the</b> midfield positions, as they do not have to turn to shoot, and they are often driving against a short stick defender. Other players prefer <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> from <b>the</b> wings and X, as it is often easier to pass to other players, who are more likely to be facing the goal for an easier shot.|$|R
