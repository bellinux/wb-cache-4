40|$|All {{documents}} 'relating to 19 decided EP patent {{applications in}} the field of genetic engineering were examined. The aim {{of the study was to}} find out, how the patentability of <b>the</b> <b>inventions</b> was evaluated by the Patent Office and by the opponents. Generally, patents have been granted without changes or with only minor changes as compared with the corresponding applications. In the cases where differences of opinion have arisen between the different parties, the most frequently discussed topics have dealt with the novelty and inventive step of <b>the</b> <b>inventions.</b> Significant questions in these cases have been the evaluation of <b>the</b> equivalence of <b>inventions</b> and <b>the</b> assessment of what a person skilled in the art would consider obvious. Broadness of the claims and insufficient description have also been subjects for discussion. The opponents consider <b>the</b> <b>inventions</b> questionable more often than the Patent Office and they pay more attention to the inventive step of <b>the</b> <b>inventions.</b> As a conclusion it can be stated that patenting of <b>the</b> genetic engineering <b>inventions</b> is still in a somewhat confused stage, and the initial liberal attitude has changed in a new, stricter direction. ...|$|R
