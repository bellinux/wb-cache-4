40|$|Late Period (3 ̆c 1500 3 ̆eyears), high-altitude (3 ̆e 2600 m asl) {{archaeological sites}} in northwestern Wyoming prove {{difficult}} to date with traditional methods. The presence of Intermountain Ware ceramics at these sites presents {{an opportunity to}} use single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to date vessel manufacture. These OSL ages also date site occupation as the vessels’ use-life is encapsulated within the standard error of the technique. This thesis develops a protocol to date quartz temper of Intermountain Ware sherds. Additionally, it investigates potential post-depositional <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> of luminescence signals by wildfires. Ceramic sherd samples were obtained from four sites in northwestern Wyoming: Boulder Ridge, High Rise Village, Caldwell Creek, and Platt. Each site, except Caldwell Creek, has existing radiocarbon ages that provide independent age control. Additionally, all sites except Platt were impacted by past wildfires of varying intensity and consequently provide {{a test of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> capabilities of wildfires. The Platt site is also the only site not located at high altitude and therefore, the sample from this site serves as a control in this study. Luminescence results demonstrate single-grain OSL dating of quartz temper from Intermountain Ware ceramics can provide improved accuracy and precision over radiocarbon dating when sherds are not adversely affected by wildfires. These results underscore the need for cultural resource managers to sample from subsurface contexts when inventorying sites impacted by high-intensity wildfires or to locate and identify sites with strong potential for high-intensity wildfires and date them prior to eventual burning. These results also validate single-grain OSL dating of ceramic temper as a valuable chronometric tool for cultural resource managers and archaeologists seeking to build and refine existing site and regional chronologies...|$|R

Isothermal experiments on Bjurbole for different heating durations suggest that at least three domains are responsible for the thermal release of radiogenic Xe- 129 (Xe*- 129) and that the system may be less susceptible to <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> than some calculations indicated. Two scenarios for the release of Xe*- 129 were proposed. In one, the mobility of Xe*- 129 is governed by diffusion in mineral grains.

Therefore, these apparent He ages obviously reflect cooling events post-granitoid intrusions. These apparent He ages can be interpreted as (A) cooling ages following total <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting,</b> (B) cooling ages following cooling from temperatures which only partially reset the He clocks, or (C) mixed ages of multiple populations. Possibility (C) is rejected for the following reasons: (1) the samples were homogeneous granitoids so all grains should have a common thermal history, and (2) as discussed above, reproducibility of the grain ages is generally reasonable (within analytical uncertainties) and over-dispersed samples/grain ages were not included for calculating the weighted mean ages. By contrast, making a distinction between (A) and (B) is difficult owing to the lack of a precise thermal analysis methodology based on He ages. Nonetheless, the He ages definitely indicate that the last cooling events occurred at or after the apparent age; in other words, the ages denote the oldest limit of the last cooling events.|$|R

For most of the samples U-Pb zircon and 40 Ar- 39 Ar mineral ages were already available (Duque-Trujillo et al., 2015). Coupled with the new AFT data these ages provide a more complete information on cooling after emplacement.

This pattern suggests that in Late Miocene, deformation due to plate transtension focused at the eastern rheological boundary of the Baja California block. Some Early Miocene AFT ages onshore Baja California could be related to plutons emplaced at shallow depths and <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> associated with the onset of volcanism at ~ 19 Ma {{in this part of the}} Peninsula.

40|$|Thermochronological {{studies of}} Variscan {{basement}} in Iberia yield cooling ages typically younger than ~ 200 Ma. In this paper, we explore the regional {{implications of this}} recurrent age maximum by examination of low and high temperature thermochronological datasets from all over Iberia. Based on these results, we show that in general the lack of cooling ages older than 200 Ma {{is the result of}} several important regional periods of <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting.</b> Resetting took place in areas of extension and burial during the Mesozoic break-up of Pangea. Evidence for large scale magmatism and mineralisation is found in Iberia during the Mesozoic, since at that time Iberia formed part of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province and a large mineralization province extending from North Africa to Western Europe. Numerical modelling allows us to assess the conditions under which rocks in the upper crust may have been thermally reset and the mechanisms likely involved. Results show that active rifting combined with shallow magmatism, {{and to a lesser extent}} deep sedimentary burial, could have led to an increase of the geothermal gradient up to ~ 73 °C/km and the reset of thermochronometers with closure temperatures up to 200 °C. Yet, we suggest that also hydrothermal activity, associated to extensional basins, played an important role to the increase of temperatures of some basement rocks above 300 °C. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

These sediments, known as the Hammamat Series, record the uncovering ofthe evolving crust of the region. We have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and Rb-Sr and K-Ar geochronologic studies of Hammamat samples collected along a single traverse. The lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus hed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks {{similar to those of}} the Dokhan Volcanics and Pink Granites, units that are preserved within the region. Rb-Sr whole-rock analyses give an 8 -point isochron age of 585 + _ 15 Ma with an initial STSr/~Sr of 0. 70323 ± 0. 00013, interpreted toapproximate closely the time of sedimentation. This is very similar to the K-Ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2 - 0. 5 #m) (588 - 567 Ma). This result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochron-ological studies indicating that Hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 Ma.

40|$|The {{accurate}} dating of {{meteorite impact}} structures on Earth {{has proven to}} be challenging. Melt sheets are amenable to high-precision dating by the U-Pb and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar methods, but many impact events do not produce them, or they are not preserved. In cases where high-temperature shock metamorphism of the target materials has occurred without widespread melting, these isotopic chronometers may be partially reset and yield dates that are difficult to interpret unambiguously as the age of impact. However, the (U-Th) /He chronometer is sensitive to <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> and can provide a powerful new tool for dating impactites. We report (U-Th) /He dates for accessory minerals from the Manicouagan impact structure in Quebec, Canada. Nine zircons from a melt sheet sample yield a weighted mean age of 213. 2 ± 5. 4 Ma (2 SE), indistinguishable from the published 214 ± 1 Ma (2 σ) U-Pb zircon age for the impact. In contrast, five apatites from this sample yield dates between 205. 9 ± 6. 5 and 162. 0 ± 5. 3 Ma (2 σ), indicating variable postimpact helium loss due to low-temperature thermal disturbance. Preimpact titanite crystals from a shocked meta-anorthosite sample yield two dates consistent with the impact age, at 212 ± 27 and 214 ± 13 Ma (2 σ), and two younger dates of 189. 6 ± 6. 9 and 192. 2 ± 9. 8 Ma (2 σ), suggestive of postimpact helium loss.

40|$|Abstract In the Montes de Toledo area, {{located in}} the axial part of the Central Hercynian zone, a {{long-term}} thermo-tectonic evolution can be deduced from apatite fission-track (AFT) data in conjunction with tight geological constraints derived from the knowledge of regional geology and other independent chronometers. The area is composed of two different blocks separated by the Toledo Shear Zone (TSZ). The northern block is a granulite facies anatectic terrane. The southern block is composed of greenschist facies Paleozoic sediments intruded by a late Hercynian granitic pluton. A total of 13 samples have been recovered for AFT analysis. AFT ages in both blocks cluster around 189 – 221 Ma, with mean confined track lengths between 11. 4 lm and 12. 4 lm. Modeling of the AFT data indicates that the thermal history is broadly similar in both blocks, which constrains the main movement of the TSZ, as essentially before the Upper Permian. AFT ages in the TSZ cluster around 124 – 164 Ma, and the track lengths vary between 11. 4 lm and 12. 4 lm. These data reveal that the fault must {{have been affected by}} a later thermal overprint as AFT ages are significantly younger than those of the footwall and hangingwall blocks. This differential <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> is likely related to the advection of localized hydrothermal fluids that are responsible for the widespread Pb–Zn mineralization along the TSZ. These results give an example of resetting AFT data by hydrothermal events. The long-term evolution suggests a lack of important Alpine tectonism in the Montes de Toledo block, in clear contrast to other nearby Hercynian areas such as the Sierra de Guadarrama, where the important effect of Alpine tectonism has almost totally erased the previous thermal signal in the AFT system...|$|R
40|$|Ar-Ar whole-rock dating {{was carried}} out {{as part of a}} {{detailed}} stratigraphical investigation of the Emeishan Basalt large igneous province (LIP) in the stratotype area, Sichuan, China. Thirteen (from twenty-one) specimens from three sections yielded reliable reversed isochron and plateau ages (maximum 1 σ errors of ≤ 2. 1 and 1. 6 m. y., respectively), and form two clusters centered on the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and Early-Late Cretaceous, with a tail spanning 82 - 40 Ma. However, all are appreciably younger than the magnetobiostratigraphically-constrained late Middle Permian (255 - 260 Ma) age of the basalts, reflecting varying degrees of <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Recently, Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous ages reported from elsewhere in the LIP have been used to infer a single 40 m. y. -long tectonic episode that affected the western Yangtze Platform. Developing this idea, the new information have been combined with data we hold for other parts of the terrain, and results from three Emeishan LIP Ar-Ar dating studies published during 2002, to give 32 reliable age dates. Three 10 - 12 m. y. events appear to be recorded {{in different parts of the}} province: Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and Early-Late Cretaceous, with a fourth shorter middle Eocene episode (the 40 m. y. Mesozoic episode appears to be a sampling artifact). Following a review of the regional deformation/tectonic features, it is argued that activity related to various phases of deformation in the Longmen Shan Thrust Belt is the most likely cause of resetting. The final suturing of the North and South China blocks may have also been responsible for the Middle Jurassic event. However, the Oligocene-present indentation of India into Asia appears not to have had an impact, possibly due to the large-scale related strike-slip faults that have effectively shielded the LIP/Sichuan Basin. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This magnetic field induced strain (MFIS) caused by twin boundary {{motion in the}} martensitic phase reaches values of about 10 % depending on composition, microstructure and texture of the material. To enable this effect special characteristics in the mechanical behaviour of the material, directly affected by microstructure and texture, are needed. Formerly {{it was possible to}} produce large strains in moderate magnetic fields only in single crystals. In this work we present results of investigations to obtain MFIS also in polycrystalline alloys. The aim is to produce strongly textured coarse grained material that shows proper mechanical behaviour for MFIS using heat treatment and training methods. The initial state forms hot extruded Ni 50 Mn 29 Ga 21 with a 5 M modulated martensitic structure at ambient temperature. The microstructure of the material shows a grain size of 100 µm and a cyclic fibre texture along extrusion direction. The stress-strain curve shows no martensitic plateau. To increase grain size and texture different heat treatments were applied. The results show that only annealing at 1000 °C leads to increased grain size but also reduces texture. To achieve a stronger texture the samples were compressed by 5 % at 1000 °C and annealed without load for 60 min afterwards. Additionally, a second treatment step under load at low temperatures was applied. This procedure leads to maximum grain size of 4 mm and sharp texture. Now the stress-strain curves demonstrate a martensitic plateau at stress levels of about 10 MPa. For further mechanical improvements thermo-mechanical training was used including compression in two directions and heating the material to 80 °C for <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting.</b> This training leads to stress-strain behaviour with more reduced stress levels of the martensitic plateau and maximum residual strain of 6 %.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the results of}} {{improving}} microstructure, texture and mechanical behaviour of hot extruded polycrystalline Ni 50 Mn 29 Ga 21 using post heat treatments and training methods are summarized. The aim is to produce a strongly textured coarse grained material that shows proper mechanical behaviour for magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). That means stress-strain curves with martensitic plateau on low stress levels with high strain values. To optimize the microstructure concerning grain size and texture, treatments were performed on cube shaped samples with a 5 M modulated martensitic structure. The initial microstructure of the hot extruded material shows a grain size of 100 µm and a cyclic fibre texture along the extrusion direction measured using high-energy synchrotron radiation. The stress-strain curve demonstrates no martensitic plateau. To increase grain size and texture different heat treatments were applied. The results showed that only heat treatment at 1000 °C leads to increased grain size. Using annealing without load a maximum grain size of about 300 µm was achieved. However, synchrotron measurements revealed a reduced texture. To achieve a stronger texture the samples were compressed to 5 % strain at 1000 °C and then further annealed without load for 60 min. This treatment leads to a maximum grain size of 4 mm. Applying a second annealing step under load at low temperatures produces a sharp texture. After these treatments the stress-strain curves exhibit a martensitic plateau at stress levels of about 10 MPa. For further mechanical improvement a thermo-mechanical training was used including compression in two directions and heating the material to 80 °C for <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting.</b> This training leads to a stress-strain behaviour with more reduced martensitic plateau and a maximum residual strain of 6 %.

This thesis addresses the exhumation of metamorphic rocks in two settings in the North American Cordillera: (1) exhumation of the Pioneer core complex rocks in Idaho, related to detachment activity {{for which the}} deformation kinematics are analyzed in detail in this thesis; (2) exhumation of rocks associated with incision of the Skagit Gorge and Ross Lake drainages, North Cascades, Washington state, as traced by fission-track age-elevation relations. In the first study, kinematic analysis was aimed at determining the relative contributions of pure and simple shear strain in the ~ 100 m thick quartzite-dominated detachment shear zone, using quartz microstructures (quartz ribbons and recrystallized grains) and crystallographic preferred orientation (measured by electron backscatter diffraction) {{as well as the}} shape preferred orientation of feldspar porphyroclasts. Results from quartz microfabric suggest a pure shear contribution of 0 - 70 %, which likely reflects the spatial and temporal distributions of crustal thinning in this detachment system. Vorticity derived from feldspar shape fabrics indicates that an initial, pure-shear dominated fabric was overprinted by an increment of simple shear dominated strain (g ~ 1. 0) that rotated feldspar clasts "in mass" out of their average orientation, likely during the formation of C' shear planes. In the second study, apatite fission-track ages were obtained from 13 samples from two subvertical profiles on the steep flanks of Skagit Gorge and Ross Lake in the North Cascades, in order to construct age-elevation relations. Results from this study are combined with previous apatite and zircon U-Th/He ages from the same samples to provide some new information about the cooling history.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect that metamictization has on the weathering of zircon in detrital continental sediments and tropical soils of the Amazon basin, Brazil. The degree of radiation damage in the near-surface region of the zircon grains was determined by Raman microprobe. In {{each of the four}} series investigated (i. e., sediment, podzol, topsoil, and subsoil horizons of lateritic soil), the degree of radiation damage ranges from less than 1014 to ~ 3. 5 × 1015 α−decay/mg. The maximum degree of radiation damage coincides with the first percolation threshold of the metamictization process at ~ 3. 5 × 1015 α-decay/mg. Below this threshold, amorphous volumes in the structure of damaged zircon are not connected to each other. The ranges of U, Th, and Pb contents (in ppm) measured by proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) microanalysis are 100 < U < 7000, 100 < Th < 18000, and 100 < Pb < 1300. Chemical ages, assessed from U, Th, and total-Pb, range between 0. 15 Ga and 2. 8 Ga. This range is roughly consistent with the ages reported for the Precambrian shields of the Amazon basin (0. 45 – 3. 5 Ga). Corresponding radiation doses range between < 2 × 1015 and 3 × 1016 α-decay/mg. Comparison of calculated doses with the degree of structural damage indicates that most of the zircon grains have experienced significant annealing. However, the degree of annealing differs from one grain to another. Thus, the acute maximum limit observed for the degree of radiation damage of the whole zircon series is better explained by low-temperature alteration or weathering processes than by <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting.</b> Following this interpretation, our results provide evidence for a dramatic decrease in the chemical durability of zircon in natural weathering environments when the radiation dose exceeds 3. 5 × 1015 α-decay/mg.

40|$|New thermochronological and geochronological {{data from}} the Archean Slave and Wyoming cratons provide key {{constraints}} on the interaction of surface, deep crustal, and mantle processes. An extensive apatite (U-Th) /He (AHe) thermochronometry dataset from the Slave craton better resolves the Phanerozoic history of burial, unroofing, and elevation change. AHe dates across the northwestern Canadian shield vary from 210 to 360 Ma, and define NNE-SSW domains with older dates in eastern Slave and younger dates westward. Thermal history simulations reveal Paleozoic heating and burial to depths 3 ̆e 4. 4 km, a subsequent westward wave of unroofing to near surface conditions by earliest Cretaceous, and a lesser burial and unroofing in Cretaceous-Early Tertiary time. These data and additional observations are consistent with western Canadian shield-wide subsidence in Paleozoic time followed by surface uplift, and require 3 ̆e 300 m of post- 100 Ma elevation gain of the Slave craton. The transition from Paleozoic-Mesozoic subsidence to uplift may reflect a shift from northern to western plate boundary controls, with the Cretaceous-Early Tertiary history controlled by Cordilleran evolution. Dynamic topography and proximity to sediment sources likely influenced the burial, erosion, and vertical motion history of the craton. Slave kimberlites emplaced during the Paleozoic-Mesozoic burial phase would have been denuded during unroofing, potentially explaining the 250 myr gap in kimberlite ages. The AHe method has been little applied in cratons, but new advances enable its successful application to these settings. The large Slave craton AHe dataset is used to more comprehensively evaluate potential causes of dispersion, such as apatite U-Th zonation, on AHe results. U-Th maps for 70 apatites reveal that all grains are zoned. However, thermal history simulations show that, except in unusual circumstances, the conventional unzoned apatite assumption will not cause misinterpretation of AHe datasets. In the Wyoming craton, automated mineralogical analysis and refined SIMS U-Pb geochronology were used to locate and date in situ mafic dike zircons as small as 5 microns, a grain size undatable by conventional techniques.

40|$|The Øygarden Complex and the Bergen Arc System are {{intriguing}} large-scale {{structures in}} the SW Norwegian Caledonides, but their formation is still incompletely understood. So far, the lack of published U-Pb zircon ages has limited clear interpretations of the geologic evolution of the Øygarden Complex. The Lyderhorn Gneiss {{is located in the}} poorly studied eastern part of the Øygarden Complex and forms the core of the Bergen Arc. Detailed field mapping was conducted and seven samples were dated by SIMS U-Pb zircon geochronology, to study the magmatic and structural formation of the Lyderhorn Gneiss. Igneous protoliths formed during the Mesoproterozoic Gothian-Telemarkian (1504 Ma) and Sveconorwegian (1041 Ma and 1026 - 1022 Ma) orogenic periods. They do not record Sveconorwegian high-grade regional metamorphism. Early Ordovician (483 Ma) <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> of metamict zircons was followed by sustained residence at elevated temperatures that annealed previous radiation damage. The U-Pb zircon system was not affected by Caledonian amphibolite facies metamorphism. The structure of the Lyderhorn Gneiss formed in one single deformation event, recorded in ENE-directed exhumational deformation from amphibolite facies to the brittle-plastic transition. Fluid-assisted strain weakening formed phyllonitic E-dipping detachment shear zones that became finally overprinted by (semi-) brittle deformation. Based on the Mesoproterozoic protolith ages, the Lyderhorn Gneiss and thereby the Øygarden Complex are correlated with the Telemarkia domain of the Baltican basement. The age of magmatism relates the Øygarden Complex with the Sirdal Magmatic Belt of southern Norway. The correlation suggests a continuous NNW-trend of Sveconorwegian domain boundaries and supports the assertion that Sveconorwegian high-T metamorphism in the Baltican basement was rather local than regional. A rapid temperature increase in the Early Ordovician is interpreted to mark the onset of Caledonian convergence. The structure of the Lyderhorn Gneiss is constrained to have formed by Early Devonian extensional deformation. Bidirectional Devonian extension in the Øygarden Complex is explained by exhumation as a Devonian extensional gneiss dome. The proposed, symmetrical core complex style of exhumation, resembles previously identified core complexes in central Norway and allows for a more consistent interpretation of basement culminations along the Norwegian margin. Possible onshore-offshore correlations are suggested for the Utsira High in the northern North Sea. Detailed structural and thermochronological studies will be needed to test the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|A {{regional}} thermal {{event in}} southwestern Arizona 17 to 18 Ma ago {{is suggested by}} discordances between fission track (FT) and K-Ar dates in Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, by the abundance of primary hydrothermal orthoclase in quenched volcanic rocks, and by the concentration of Mn, Ba, Cu, Ag, and Au deposits near detachment faults.

40|$|The {{method of}} quartz {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is widely used, but generally limited to the past ~ 0. 1 million years (Ma) due to early saturation of the desired signal.

Here we explore the usability of the VSL signal to date older quartz samples from palaeosols, whose ages are bracketed by KeAr ages and palaeomagnetic data of the interbedded basalts, emplaced between 1. 6 and 0. 7 Ma. VSL ages from three palaeosols largely underestimate the independent ages of their overlying basalts.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} two novel {{approaches for}} the application of luminescence dating techniques to Quaternary volcanic eruptions: crystalline xenoliths from lava flows are demonstrated to be basically suitable for luminescence dating, and a set of phreatic explosion deposits from the Late Quaternary Vakinankaratra volcanic field in central Madagascar is successfully dated with infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL). Using a numerical model approach and experimental verification, the potential for <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> of luminescence signals of xenoliths in lava flows is demonstrated. As microdosimetry is an important aspect when using sample material extracted from crystalline whole rocks, autoradiography using image plates is introduced to the field of luminescence dating as a method for detection and assessment of spatially resolved radiation inhomogeneities. Determinations of fading rates of feldspar samples have been observed to result in aberrant g-values if the pause between preheat and measurement in the delayed measurements was kept short. A systematic investigation reveals that the phenomenon is caused by the presence of three signal components with differing individual fading behaviour. As this is restricted to short pauses, it is possible to determine a minimal required delay between preheating and measurement after which the aberrant behaviour disappears. This is applied in the measuring of 12 samples from phreatic explosion deposits from the Antsirabe – Betafo region in the Late Quaternary Vakinankaratra volcanic field. The samples were taken from stratigraphically correlatable sections and appear to represent at least three phreatic events, one of which created the Lac Andraikiba maar near Antsirabe. The obtained ages indicate that the eruptive activity in the region started in the Late Pleistocene between 113. 9 and 99. 6 ka. A second layer in the Betafo area is dated at approximately 73 ka and the Lac Andraikiba deposits give an age between 63. 9 and 50. 7 ka. The youngest phreatic layer is dated between 33. 7 and 20. 7 ka. These ages are the first recorded direct ages of such volcanic deposits, as well as the first and only direct ages for the Late Quaternary volcanism in the Vakinankaratra volcanic field. This illustrates the huge potential of this new method for volcanology and geochronology, as it enables direct numerical dating of a type of volcanic deposit which has not been successfully directly dated by any other method so far...|$|R
40|$|The Cree Lake Zone (Hearne Province) and Western Granulite domain (Rae Province), in {{northern}} Saskatchewan, are contrasting {{parts of the}} variably reworked, (?) upper plate western hinterland of the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogen. Their junction {{is defined by the}} Virgin River Shear Zone, a part of the more extensive Snowbird "tectonic zone". Subsurface extension of the ∼ 2. 0 Ga Thelon Orogen lies west of the Western Granulite domain. We present UPb zircon ages, SmNd and RbSr isotopic data from the Cree Lake Zone and Western Granulite domain, and from the Junction Granite which intrudes the Virgin River Shear Zone. Data from the Western Granulite domain indicate that prevalent granulite facies metamorphism occurred between ∼ 2. 3 and 2. 0 Ga, but is imposed on Archean protoliths ∼ 2. 8 - 3. 0 Ga old. Low amphibolite facies retrogression, which increases toward the Virgin River Shear Zone, probably postdates 2. 1 Ga. Data from the Cree Lake Zone also yield Archean protolith ages as old as 3. 0 Ga, and some rocks yield interpreted high-grade metamorphic overprint ages of ∼ 2. 3 - 2. 0 Ga. However, two samples yield data indicating "Hudsonian" high-grade metamorphic overprint ∼ 1. 87 to 1. 81 Ga. The Junction Granite has a UPb zircon age of 1. 82 ± 0. 30 Ga, but relict zircons and SmNd data show that it was derived by melting of Archean crust. High-grade mid-crustal <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> in the Western Granulite domain may be coeval with the 1. 9 - 2. 0 Ga Thelon Orogen, although the data do not preclude an earlier event or events. Similar, ∼ 2. 3 - 2. 1 Ga reworking extends into the Cree Lake Zone, but high-grade "Hudsonian" (1. 87 - 1. 84 Ga) reworking is also evident in parts of this zone well {{to the west of the}} Wollaston domain, and may extend entirely across the zone to the Virgin River Shear Zone. Relative importance of the "Thelon" and "Hudsonian" overprints in Cree Lake Zone is unknown. Data from the Junction Granite and Western Granulite domain suggest that all recorded high-strain events in the Virgin River Shear Zone postdate ∼ 2. 3 Ga and are thus unrelated to deep-crustal Archean granulite facies mylonites in the Tantato-Black Lake segment of the Snowbird tectonic zone, north of the Athabasca basin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOceanic plagiogranites and peridotite-hosted granites (PHG) of the Thetford-Mines {{ophiolite}} (TMO) yield mean U-Pb zircon ages of 479. 2 ± 1. 6 Ma and 469. 5 ± 2. 8 Ma, and {{are interpreted}} {{to be the}} products of fractionation of basaltic magma and melting of the Laurentian margin, respectively. The existing 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age for the ophiolitic metamorphic sole of the TMO is a hornblende isochron age of 477 ± 5 Ma for amphibolite facies rocks. Sites previously sampled for U-Pb and 39 Ar- 40 Ar analyses were resampled for more accurate 39 Ar- 40 Ar dating, {{in order to better}} constrain the thermo-tectonic evolution of the ophiolite and underlying Laurentian margin rocks on which they were overthrust, and quantify the time required for obduction of Tethyan-type ophiolites in the Canadian Appalachians. Amphiboles from TMO gabbro and plagiogranite yield 39 Ar- 40 Ar plateau ages of 477 - 475 Ma. In contrast, muscovites from PHG yield cooling ages of 466 - 465 Ma, and show evidence for <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> at ca. 460 Ma for both a granitic mylonite and a crosscutting pegmatite facies. The amphibolitic metamorphic sole yields 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages of ca. 471 Ma in amphibole, and high-temperature ages of ca. 466 Ma in muscovite, with evidence for recrystallization to ages as young as 457 Ma. Muscovites from the sub-ophiolitic Laurentian metasedimentary basement, and micaschist clasts in supraophiolitic debris flows of the TMO, yield similar pseudo-plateau and high-temperature ages of ca. 463 - 464 Ma. The U-Pb and 39 Ar- 40 Ar data suggest that the obduction of peri-Laurentian oceanic crust lasted approximately 5 to 10 m. y. Since both facies formed approximately m. y. after the ophiolitic crust, this supports models whereby the still-hot ophiolitic mantle provided the heat needed to generate the PHG and the metamorphic sole between ca. 475 and 470 Ma. Muscovite ages of PHG record cooling below ca. 450 - 500 °C by ca. 465 Ma, but 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages from both a mylonitized PHG facies and micaschist clasts suggest that the emplacement of the oceanic lithosphere on the Laurentia margin had nearly ended by ca. 460 Ma, likely due to foreland-directed downward thrust propagation and related exhumation of the collisional wedge. The new age data imply that the southern Quebec ophiolites were thrust 100 s of km over the Laurentian margin, which has major implications for the location of the subduction suture and {{the early stages of the}} Taconic orogeny in the Northern Appalachians...|$|R
40|$|Following the Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogeny, the Arabian-Nubian Shield of North Africa and Arabia was eroded {{and then}} covered by Cambrian {{sandstones}} that record {{the onset of}} platform sedimentation. We applied K-feldspar 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, zircon and apatite fission-track, and apatite (U-Th) /He thermochronology to detritus from Cambrian sandstones of southern Israel deposited at ca. 500 Ma. U-Pb detrital zircon ages from these sandstones predate deposition and record the earlier Neoproterozoic crustal evolution of the Pan-African orogens. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages from 50 single grains of K-feldspar yield a Cambrian mean of ca. 535 Ma. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age spectrum of a multi-grain K-feldspar aliquot displays diffusion behavior compatible with > 560 Ma cooling later affected by a heating event. Assuming that the high-temperature domains of the K-feldspars have not been affected by subsequent (hydro) thermal events, and taking previously published K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages {{from other parts of}} the East African Orogen at face value, these ages apparently record Pan-African <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> below a thick volcano-sedimentary pile similar to the Saramuj conglomerate in Jordan and/or the Hammamat in Egypt. Detrital zircon fission-track (ZFT) ages cluster around 380 Ma, consistent with previous ZFT results from Neoproterozoic basement and sediments of the region, revealing that the Cambrian platform sequence experienced a middle Devonian thermal event and low-grade metamorphism. Regional correlation indicates that during Devonian time the sedimentary cover atop the Cambrian in Israel was never in excess of 2. 5 km, requiring an abnormally steep geothermal gradient to explain the complete ZFT annealing. A basal Carboniferous unconformity can be traced from Syria to southern Saudi Arabia, suggesting that the observed Devonian ZFT ages represent a regional tectonothermal event. Similar Devonian ZFT ages were reported from Arabian-Nubian Shield basement outcrops in the Eastern Desert, 500 km south of Eilat. The detrital apatites we studied all have extremely rounded cores suggestive of a distant provenance, but some grains also feature distinct euhedral, U-rich apatite overgrowth rims. Authigenic apatite may have grown during the late Devonian thermal event we dated by ZFT, coinciding with existing Rb-Sr ages from authigenic clays in the same deposits and leading to the conclusion that the Devonian event was probably hydrothermal. Like the ZFT ages, the detrital apatite fission-track (AFT) ages were also completely reset after deposition. Sixty single-grain detrital AFT ages group at ca. 270 Ma with significant dispersion. Inverse modeling of the AFT data indicate extended and/or repeated residence in the AFT partial annealing zone, in turn suggesting an episodic burial-erosion history during the Mesozoic caused by low-amplitude vertical motions. Seven detrital apatite (U-Th) /He ages scatter between 33 and 77 Ma, possibly resulting from extreme compositional zonation associated with the authigenic U-rich overgrowths. The ca. 70 Ma (U-Th) /He ages are more likely to be accurate, setting 1 – 2 km as an upper limit (depending on the geothermal gradient) on the post-Cretaceous exhumation of the Cambrian sandstone and showing no evidence for substantial denudation related to Tertiary rifting of the Red Sea...|$|R
40|$|In the Dabieshan, the {{available}} models for exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks are poorly constrained by structural data. A comprehensive structural and kinematic map {{and a general}} cross-section of the Dabieshan including its foreland fold belt and the Northern Dabieshan Domain (Foziling and Luzenguang groups) are presented here. South Dabieshan consists from bottom to top of stacked allochtons: (1) an amphibolite facies gneissic unit, devoid of UHP rocks, interpreted here as the relative autochton; (2) an UHP allochton; (3) a HP rock unit (Susong group) mostly retrogressed into greenschist facies micaschists; (4) a weakly metamorphosed Proterozoic slate and sandstone unit; and (5) an unmetamorphosed Cambrian to Early Triassic sedimentary sequence unconformably covered by Jurassic sandstone. All these units exhibit a polyphase ductile deformation characterized by (i) a NW–SE lineation with a top-to-the-NW shearing, and (ii) a southward refolding of early ductile fabrics. The Central Dabieshan is a 100 -km scale migmatitic dome. Newly discovered eclogite xenoliths in a Cretaceous granitoid dated at 102 Ma by the U–Pb method on titanite demonstrate that migmatization post-dates HP–UHP metamorphism. Ductile faults formed in the subsolidus state coeval to migmatization allow us to characterize the structural pattern of doming. Along the dome margins, migmatite is gneissified under post-solidus conditions and mylonitic–ultramylonitic fabrics commonly develop. The north and west boundaries of the Central Dabieshan metamorphics, i. e. the Xiaotian–Mozitan and Macheng faults, are ductile normal faults formed before Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous. A Cretaceous reworking is recorded by synkinematic plutons. North of the Xiaotian–Mozitan fault, the North Dabieshan Domain consists of metasediments and orthogneiss (Foziling and Luzenguang groups) metamorphosed under greenschist to amphibolite facies which never experienced UHP metamorphism. A rare N–S-trending lineation with top-to-the-south shearing is dated at 260 Ma by the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method on muscovite. This early structure related to compressional tectonics is reworked by top-to-the-north extensional shear bands. The main deformation of the Dabieshan consists of a NW–SE-stretching lineation which wraps around the migmatitic dome but exhibits a consistently top-to-the-NW sense of shear. The Central Dabieshan is interpreted as an extensional migmatitic dome bounded by an arched, top-to-the-NW, detachment fault. This structure may account for {{a part of the}} UHP rock exhumation. However, the abundance of amphibolite restites in the Central Dabieshan migmatites and the scarcity of eclogites (found only in a few places) argue for an early stage of exhumation and retrogression of UHP rocks before migmatization. This event is coeval to the N–S extensional structures described in the North Dabieshan Domain. Recent radiometric dates suggest that early exhumation and subsequent migmatization occurred in Triassic–Liassic times. The main foliation is deformed by north-verging recumbent folds coeval to the south-verging folds of the South Dabieshan Domain. An intense Cretaceous magmatism accounts for <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> of most of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates. A lithosphere-scale exhumation model, involving continental subduction, synconvergence extension with inversion of southward thrusts into NW-ward normal faults and crustal melting is presented...|$|R
40|$|Three major lithotectonic {{units have}} {{recently}} been defined in the Grenville Province of eastern Labrador {{on the basis of}} contrasting lithologic associations, structural style and metamorphic grade. Two of these units, the Groswater Bay and Lake Melville Terranes are interpreted to represent parts of the parautochthonous and allochthonous units, respectively, which are two regional subdivisions of the Grenvllle Province in Labrador. [...] Geothermometry and geobarometry estimates derived from garnet - biotite - plagloclase - Al₂SiO₅ - quartz and garnet - orthopyroxene - clinopyroxene - plagioclase - quartz equilibria of selected paragneiss and mafic lithologies in the Sandwich Bay area suggest contrasting metamorphic P-T conditions of the two terranes. Estimates determined from the Groswater Bay Terrane range from 615 °C to 850 °C and 10 - 12 kbar, suggesting derivation from depths on the order of 30 to 40 km. In contrast estimates from the Lake Melville Terrane range from 650 °C to 900 °C and 6 - 10 kbar implying crustal derivation from 20 to 30 km. Microstructural relationships and mineral chemistry of the assemblages in each terrane suggest that the P-T estimates obtained from each terrane are representative of Grenvillian metamorphic conditions. [...] Equilibrium P-T paths constructed from the geothermobarometry estimates are interpreted to represent a portion of the uplift trajectory for both the Groswater Bay and Lake Melville Terranes. These paths suggest that both terranes followed a near isothermal uplift path, implying rapid decompression during cooling. [...] ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar incremental release radiometric dating of hornblende concentrates from orthogneiss and associated mafic dikes from the study area reveal contrasting ages from both terranes. Age spectra from the Groswater Bay Terrane are generally discordant and are interpreted to result from a combination of the presence of excess argon components and partial gas loss as a result of <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> of the argon system. One sample from the Groswater Bay Terrane yields a reasonably defined plateau age of 1260 +/- 5 Ma. A similar plateau age of 1241 +/- 3 Ma is obtained from a sample immediately south of the Rigolet thrust zone in the Lake Melville Terrane. The significance of these pre-Grenvillian ages is at present not understood since they do not correlate with any major event (thermal or cooling) previously known in the Grenville Province. However, they are tentatively interpreted to date a closure of argon in hornblende at ca. 1250 Ma. Spectra obtained from samples from the southern Lake Melville Terrane record reasonably well defined ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar plateaux. One sample yields a plateau age of 1070 +/- 50 Ma, which is in broad agreement with the 1030 Ma age suggested for the culmination of Grenvillian metamorphism in the Lake Melville Terrane and is thus interpreted to represent the very rapid uplift following Grenvillian thermal overprinting. The most southerly samples yield younger ages of 1020 +/- 8 Ma and 980 Ma +/- 12 Ma and are interpreted to results from slower post-Grenvillian uplift and subsequent cooling through the retention temperature required for argon in the hornblende crystal lattice...|$|R

In Lafayette mesostasis, we detected a secondary degassing event at approximately 1. 1 Ga, which is not related to iddingsite formation.

Cosmic-ray exposure ages for these meteorites and for Governador Valadares were calculated from bulk rock concentrations of cosmogenic nuclides 3 He, 21 Ne, and 38 Ar. Individual results are similar to literature data. The considerable scatter of T 3, T 21, and T 38 ages is due to systematic uncertainties related to bulk rock and target element chemistry, production rates, and shielding effects. This hampers efforts to better constrain the hypothesis of a single ejection event for all nakhlites and Chassigny from a confined Martian surface terrain (Eugster 2003; Garrison and Bogard 2005).

These data clarify {{the origins and}} histories, particularly cosmic-ray exposure and regolith histories, of the aubrites and their parent body(ies). Accurate cosmic-ray exposure ages were obtained using the 81 Kr–Kr method for three meteorites: 52 ± 3, 49 ± 10 and 117 ± 14 Ma for Bishopville, Cumberland Falls and Mayo Belwa, respectively. Mayo Belwa shows the longest cosmic-ray exposure age determined by the 81 Kr–Kr method so far, close {{to the age of}} 121 Ma for Norton County. These are the longest ages among stony meteorites. Distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of aubrites implies 4 – 9 break-up events (except anomalous aubrites) on the parent body. Six aubrites show “exposure at the surface” on their parent body(ies) : (i) neutron capture 36 Ar, 80 Kr, 82 Kr and/or 128 Xe probably produced on the respective parent body (Bishopville, Cumberland Falls, Mayo Belwa, Peña Blanca Spring, Shallowater and ALHA 78113); and/or (ii) chondritic trapped noble gases, which were likely released from chondritic inclusions preserved in the aubrite hosts (Cumberland Falls, Peña Blanca Spring and ALHA 78113). The concentrations of 128 Xe from neutron capture on 127 I vary among four measured specimens of Cumberland Falls (0. 5 – 76 × 10 − 14 cm 3 STP/g), but are correlated with those of radiogenic 129 Xe, implying that the concentrations of (128 Xe) n and (129 Xe) rad reflect variable abundances of iodine among specimens. The ratios of (128 Xe) n/(129 Xe) rad obtained in this work are different for Mayo Belwa (0. 045), Cumberland Falls (0. 015) and Shallowater (0. 001), meaning that neutron fluences, radiogenic 129 Xe retention ages, or both, are different among these aubrites. Shallowater contains abundant trapped Ar, Kr and Xe (2. 2 × 10 − 7, 9. 4 × 10 − 10 and 2. 8 × 10 − 10 cm 3 STP/g, respectively) as reported previously (Busemann and Eugster, 2002). Isotopic compositions of Kr and Xe in Shallowater are consistent with those of Q (a primordial noble gas component trapped in chondrites). The Ar/Kr/Xe compositions are somewhat fractionated from Q, favoring lighter elements. Because of the unbrecciated nature of Shallowater, Q-like noble gases are considered to be primordial in origin. Fission Xe is found in Cumberland Falls, Mayo Belwa, Peña Blanca Spring, ALHA 78113 and LAP 02233. The majority of fission Xe is most likely 244 Pu-derived, and about 10 – 20 % seems to be 238 U-derived at 136 Xe. The observed (136 Xe) Pu corresponds to 0. 019 – 0. 16 ppb of 244 Pu, from which the 244 Pu/U ratios are calculated as 0. 002 – 0. 009. These ratios resemble those of chondrites and other achondrites like eucrites, suggesting that no <b>thermal</b> <b>resetting</b> of the Pu–Xe system occurred after 4. 5 Ga ago. We also determined oxygen isotopic compositions for four aubrites with chondritic noble gases and a new aubrite LAP 02233. In spite of their chondritic noble gas signatures, oxygen with chondritic isotopic compositions was found only in a specimen of Cumberland Falls (Δ 17 O of 0. 3 ‰).

When the Cr. concentration is 5. 3 at % or 10. 5 at %, the crystallization mechanism is still growth-dominated as Sb 2 Te 3, which is beneficial for high speed and high density storage, whereas the necessary crystallization energy increases with more Cr-dopants, leading to higher amorphous <b>thermal</b> stability. <b>RESET</b> results by multiple pulses-Show that Cr-dopants will not increase the power consumption, {{and the increase in}} Cr-dopants could greatly increase the antioxidant capacity.
