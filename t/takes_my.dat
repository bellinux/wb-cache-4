500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal {{range in the}} song span from the note of Eb3 to Cb5. Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> breath away, b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E
500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

[...] In an attempt to deflect publishers' demands for more Holmes stories, he raised his price to a level intended to discourage them, but found they were willing to pay even the large sums he asked. As a result, {{he became one of the}} best-paid authors of his time.|$|E

[...] "I don't {{believe that the}} country will ever know the full contribution to the prosecution of the recent war by this quiet, modest, sincere, but tremendously effective and capable naval officer", said New York Congressman W. Sterling Cole. Truman Committee staffer John J. Tolan marveled, [...] "In an entire lifetime, one is extremely fortunate to watch such men at work." [...] Tolan once asked Horne why he {{spent so much time}} drawing and redrawing boxes in organizational charts. Horne replied, [...] "It isn't the drawing of the boxes that <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> time. It is the selection of the names that go in the boxes. Sometimes, in order to use the right man to his full capacity, you have to change the boxes." ...|$|E
