50|$|Soldered joints {{can fail}} {{in many ways}} like {{electromigration}} and formation of brittle intermetallic layers. Some failures show only at extreme joint temperatures, hindering troubleshooting. Thermal expansion mismatch between the printed circuit board material and its packaging strains the part-to-board bonds; while leaded parts can absorb the strain by bending, leadless parts rely on the solder to absorb stresses. Thermal cycling may lead to fatigue cracking of the solder joints, especially with elastic solders; various approaches are used to mitigate such incidents. Loose particles, like bonding wire and weld flash, can form in the device cavity and migrate inside the packaging, causing often intermittent and shock-sensitive shorts. Corrosion may cause buildup of oxides and other nonconductive products on the contact surfaces. When closed, these then show unacceptably high resistance; they may also migrate and cause shorts. Tin whiskers can form on <b>tin-coated</b> metals like the internal side of the packagings; loose whiskers then can cause intermittent short circuits inside the packaging. Cables, {{in addition to the}} methods described above, may fail by fraying and fire damage.|$|E

UHMWPE wear was determined for plates in their undamaged form and following simulated third-body damage to produce scratches similar to those observed on retrieved implants. In their undamaged form, the coatings produced a similar wear rate of UHMWPE to that with the uncoated Co–Cr plates. However, in their damaged form, <b>TiN-coated</b> plates showed significantly lower polyethylene wear than uncoated wrought Co–Cr plates (analysis of variance; a 0. 05). The <b>TiN-coated</b> plates prevented the generation of high scratch lips due to their higher hardness, producing much smaller Rp values (0. 19 mm) than the scratched uncoated Co–Cr plates (0. 92 – 1. 15 mm).

Seven pairs of implant fixtures, abutments and abutment screws for each system were selected and all the fixtures were perpendicularly mounted in liquid unsaturated polyesther with dental surveyor. After 20 times of repeated closing and opening test, the evaluation for the change of inner surface of implant and <b>TiN-coated</b> abutment screw, and weight loss were measured.
