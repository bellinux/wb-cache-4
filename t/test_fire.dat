25|$|Three {{guns were}} {{converted}} into railway guns 130/50 NRaut (Raut = rautatietykki, railway gun) in 1964 in the Hanko Coastal Artillery Battalion. The railway wagon {{was attached to}} rails with clamps and supported from the sides by wooden planks and support beams on track sides. In 1972 the three guns were converted back to static coastal guns and installed on Glosholma fort of the Suomenlinna Coastal Artillery Regiment. Three spare gun shields were used on 152/46 VLo guns installed in Sommar√∂ fort on Replot and two other gun shields as armoured observation posts on the <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> sites at Puolustusvoimien Tutkimuskeskus (Finnish Defense Forces Research Facility) and Keuruun Pioneerivarikko (Keuruu Engineering Depot). In the 1980s it was attempted to convert the ammunition of the 130/50 N guns as sea target shells for 130 TK turret guns, but the project failed. The three guns in Glosholma were removed from service in the 1990s, but left on their positions. Additionally two spare guns were in storage. One gun was placed on display in Kuivasaari in 2005. The origin of the designation N (also Nl or NI) is uncertain, but most likely stood for Neuvostoliittolainen (from Soviet Union). The gun had a nickname Nikolajev in Finland.|$|E
500|$|Command posts were dug in {{and weapons}} pits and shell scrapes were commenced, yet many were not {{completed}} to any depth {{due to a}} lack of time, while a heavy rainfall started at 18:00 and soon filled the pits with water anyway. No claymore mines or barbed wire were laid out either, as the wire had not yet arrived, while lack of materials also prevented the construction of overhead protection. 7.62mm M60 machine-guns were placed out around the perimeter, but there was no time to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> them or to properly tie in their arcs of fire. Meanwhile, 90mm M67 recoilless rifles (RCLs) from the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon armed with High Explosive Anti-tank (HEAT) and anti-personnel flechette ammunition were sited to support the forward machine-guns. Due to their previous experiences fighting the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province, the Australians were not overly alarmed despite the defences at FSB Coral suffering due to the hasty deployment and, although the recent fighting involving the US 1st Division only [...] to the west may have been additional cause for concern, its extent was unknown to the Australians at the time. Expecting the North Vietnamese to be operating in small groups while trying to avoid battle as they had done during the last three weeks, there was little thought of a major threat to the FSB. Commencing night routine, sentries were posted while the rest of the Australians stood down to get some sleep.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 July 1943, Eglin {{suffered}} {{its worst}} {{loss of life}} when 17 personnel were killed in an explosives test at ~1700 hrs. Wartime censorship {{and the fact that}} 15 of the 17 were airmen of the African-American-staffed 867th Aviation Engineering Battalion contributed to the accident receiving virtually no publicity. The identities of the dead, including the two white officers supervising, were never released, and only one small newspaper article was published mentioning the incident. A documentary, [...] "The Eglin 17", debuted at the 2009 African American Heritage Month luncheon at the Eglin Air Force Base Officer's Club [...] on 18 February 2009, providing the story of the forgotten accident. [...] "The cause and circumstances surrounding the incident remain 'clouded in mystery,' according to the documentary," [...] although Lt. Col.

By January, the locomotive's jacketing had been installed and painted, and its headlight was restored.

5000|$|During static <b>test</b> <b>firing,</b> the kerosene-based RP-1 fuel left {{hydrocarbon}} {{deposits and}} vapors {{in the engine}} post <b>test</b> <b>firing.</b> These {{had to be removed}} from the engine to avoid problems during engine handling and future firing, and the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) was used to clean the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each <b>test</b> <b>firing.</b> The cleaning procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30-35 minutes, depending upon the engine and the severity of the deposits. For some engines, the engine's gas generator and LOX dome were also flushed with TCE prior to <b>test</b> <b>firing.</b> [...] The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.|$|R
