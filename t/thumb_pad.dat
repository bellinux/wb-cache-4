25|$|In humans, {{the distal}} pads are wider {{than in other}} {{primates}} because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the distal pads can therefore conform to uneven surfaces while pressure is distributed more evenly in the finger tips. The distal pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> to mold around an object.|$|E

5000|$|Many gamers were {{confused}} after {{the press conference}} about whether the Wii U is an entirely new system or just a new controller for the Wii. The Wii U was, however, a whole new home console system developed by Nintendo. The system was released on November 18, 2012 in North America, November 30, 2012 in Europe and Australia, and on December 8, 2012 in Japan. It featured a new controller with a 6.2 inch touchscreen, two <b>thumb</b> <b>pads,</b> four shoulder buttons, a directional pad, and four lettered buttons. It also featured an accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, Near Field Communications (NFC), and built-in microphone, similar those in the Nintendo 3DS.|$|R
5000|$|Each sportsperson, cornerman or cutman has a {{preferred}} wrapping method {{based on the}} situation and experience.

50|$|A nuptial pad (also {{known as}} <b>thumb</b> <b>pad,</b> or nuptial excrescence) is a {{secondary}} sex characteristic present on some mature male frogs and salamanders. Triggered by androgen hormones, this breeding gland (a type of mucus gland) appears as a spiked epithelial swelling on the forearm and prepollex that aids with grip, used primarily by males to grasp (or clasp) females during amplexus. They {{can also be used}} in male-male combat in some species.|$|E

We had to pull in the kite, put up another one--get it out, {{and all the time}} keep the school in sight. The tuna traveled fast. The third try on light tackle resulted in another fine strike, and another tuna that broke the line.|$|R
60|$|Signets.--Many {{excellent}} and worthy bushmen have {{the misfortune of}} {{not knowing how to}} write: should any such be placed in a post of confidence by an explorer, it might be well that he should cut for himself a signet out of soft stone--such as the europeans of bygone generations, and the Turks of the last one, very generally employed. A device is cut on the seal; before using it, the paper is moistened with a wet finger, and the ink is dabbed over the ring with another; the impression is then made, using the ball of the <b>thumb</b> for a <b>pad.</b>|$|R
60|$|I saw him--huge, brown, wide, weaving {{after my}} bait. Then he hit {{it with his}} sword. I {{imagined}} I could feel him cut it. Winding in, I found the bait cut off neatly back of the head. While Dan hurried with another bait I watched for the swordfish, and saw {{him back in the}} wake, rather deep. He was following us. It was an intensely exciting moment. I let the bait drift back. Almost at once I felt that peculiar rap at my bait, then another. Somehow I knew he had cut off another flying-fish. I reeled in. He had severed this bait in the middle. Frantically we baited again. I let out a long line, and we drifted. Hope was almost gone when there came a swift tug on my line, and then the reel whirred. I <b>thumbed</b> the <b>pad</b> lightly. Dan yelled for me to let him have it. I was all tingling with wonderful thrills. What a magnificent strike! He took line so fast it amazed me.|$|R

5000|$|The thumb draw {{uses only}} the thumb, the strongest single digit, {{to grasp the}} string. The index and/or middle fingers close over {{the outside of the}} thumb to {{reinforce}} the grip.

The blades of both varieties are capped {{with a plastic}} or rubber piece, with a button at the tip in electric blades, that provides information when the blade tip touches the opponent. (There are also a range of plastic swords made by varying manufacturers for use by juniors.) Lacking the button and associated electrical mechanism, a judge is required to determine the scoring and the victor in a tournaments with nonelectric foils.|$|E
40|$|After a brief {{reminder}} about previous work, {{this paper}} addresses the dynamic characterization of fluid-filled soft pads for robotic hands. The adopted pad specimens are constituted {{by a single}} hyper-elastic material having hardness {{similar to that of}} the human <b>thumb.</b> The overall <b>pad</b> thickness is then divided into a continuous skin layer and an internal layer having communicating voids which are hermetically sealed and filled with a viscous fluid. Despite a more complicated design, it has been proven [1 - 3] that the pads present enhanced compliance and damping properties, a lower thickness and a higher surface hardness when compared to previously published solutions. In addition, a quasi-linear model, frequently used to describe the behavior of soft biological tissues can be applied in order to predict and control the pad interaction with the environment during grasping and manipulation tasks. In particular, the experimental tests necessary to evaluate the parameters which determine the pad dynamic response are described and discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{morphology}} {{of human}} pollical distal phalanges (PDP) closely reflects {{the adaptation of}} human hands for refined precision grip with pad-to-pad contact. The presence of these precision grip-related traits in the PDP of fossil hominins has been related to human-like hand proportions (i. e. short hands with a long thumb) enabling the <b>thumb</b> and finger <b>pads</b> to contact. Although this has been traditionally linked to the appearance of stone tool-making, the alternative hypothesis of an earlier origin [...] related to the freeing of the hands thanks to the advent of terrestrial bipedalism [...] is also possible given the human-like intrinsic hand proportion found in australopiths. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We perform morphofunctional and morphometric (bivariate and multivariate) analyses of most available hominin pollical distal phalanges, including Orrorin, Australopithecus, Paranthropous and fossil Homo, in order to investigate their morphological affinities. Our {{results indicate that the}} thumb morphology of the early biped Orrorin is more human-like than that of australopiths, in spite of its ancient chronology (ca. 6 Ma). Moreover, Orrorin already displays typical human-like features related to precision grasping. CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce previous hypotheses relating the origin of refined manipulation of natural objects [...] not stone tool-making [...] with the relaxation of locomotor selection pressures on the forelimbs. This suggests that human hand length proportions are largely plesiomorphic, {{in the sense that they}} more closely resemble the relatively short-handed Miocene apes than the elongated hand pattern of extant hominoids. With the advent of terrestrial bipedalism, these hand proportions may have been co-opted by early hominins for enhanced manipulative capabilities that, in turn, would have been later co-opted for stone tool-making in the genus Homo, more encephalized than the previous australopiths. This hypothesis remains may be further tested by the finding of more complete hands of unequivocally biped early hominins...|$|R

50|$|This species' head is {{wider than}} long; {{the skin on}} the dorsum is highly {{wrinkled}} with transverse corrugated folds - three discontinuous longitudinal folds, one dorsolaterally and two laterally; the webbing on toes is medium (three-quarters of the length); two yellowish bands occur on the dorsolateral area, prominent from subadult to adult stage; femoral glands are present. N. dattatreyaensis is a medium-sized (about 40 mm) frog active during night. The <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> and femoral glands are prominent in mature males. The eyes are golden yellow with black rhomboidal pupils. The upper {{surface of the body}} is reddish-black to stone black, with two yellow lateral bands. In day time, the frog prefers to hide below small boulders and damp leaf litter along the slow-flowing streams of the Shola forests in the hill ranges.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary role}} of the hand itself is {{grasping}} and manipulation; tasks for which the hand has been adapted to two main grips — power grip and precision grip. In a power grip an object is held against the palm and in a precision grip an object is held with the fingers, both grips are performed by intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles together. Most importantly, the relatively strong thenar muscles of the thumb and the thumb's flexible first joint allow the special opposition movement that brings the distal <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> {{in direct contact with}} the distal pads of the other four digits. Opposition is a complex combination of thumb flexion and abduction that also requires the thumb to be rotated 90° about its own axis. Without this complex movement, humans {{would not be able to}} perform a precision grip.|$|E

40|$|To learn whether tactile {{sensitivity}} is decreased in elderly adults, we measured touch thresholds {{on the pad}} of the index finger in individuals aged 19 to 88 years. Semmes-Weinstein aesthesiometer filaments were used in a forced-choice procedure to eliminate response biases among subjects. Digit temperature and health data were also collected. Tactile thresholds increased significantly with age. A large proportion of elderly individuals had thresholds that were {{higher than the average}} for young adults, although older people varied widely in touch sensitivity. Neither reported illness nor medication use was significantly related to tactile threshold. Key Words: Tactile sensitivity, Age, Elderly adults A LTHOUGH touch sensation is of utmostimportance in the ability to manually lo-cate, manipulate, and identify objects, there are very few systematic investigations on changes in {{tactile sensitivity}} as a function of age (Kenshalo, 1977).

40|$|The plasmatic {{profiles}} of androgens, estradiol, and progesterone, together with gonads and SSC modifications, have been followed, throughout the post-reproductive period in two Rana esculenta populations, inhabiting, respectively, a mountain poud (Colfiorito) and a sea level lagoon (Lesina). Testosterone and progesterone progressively {{decrease in the}} blood until July, while estradiol shows, in both sexes, {{an increase in the}} same month. Testosterone depletion accounts for <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> atrophy in the male and probably, in both sexes, for the summer interruption of sexual behavior. The estradiol increase could be linked to the induction of vitellogenin synthesis by the liver or, alternatively, could act through negative feed-back on the brain centers involved in GnRF synthesis and therefore it could be responsible for an inhibition of LH release and, in turn, of androgen synthesis/secretion by the gonads. The last function can be framed in the endocrine regulation of the so-called “refractory period” which interrupts the breeding during the summer. The hematic level of progesterone is higher during the ovulation period and {{this is consistent with the}} role assigned to the hormone, i. e., the induction of jelly release from oviductal glands. The hormonal trends in the blood of the two frog populations are very similar, although some differences exist in the levels of testosterone and progesterone...|$|E
40|$|By {{analyzing}} the kinematics of repetitive, constant- amplitude, finger oppositions, {{we compared the}} impairment of individual and nonindividual finger movements in patients with Parkinson’s disease. In one task, subjects tapped only the index finger against the thumb (individual oppositions); in the other task, they tapped all four fingers together against the <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> (nonindividual oppositions). We used an optoelectronic motion analysis system to record movements in three-dimensional space and recorded three 5 -second trials for each task. We counted how many finger oppositions subjects performed during each trial and measured the duration and amplitude of the flexions and extensions. We also calculated {{the duration of the}} pauses after flexion and extension. We assessed the deterioration of motor performance in patients by investigating the changes in speed and amplitude with task completion. During both tasks, normal subjects and patients performed finger flexions faster than extensions, and they invariably paused longer after flexion than after extension. Patients performed individual and nonindividual finger movements slowly and with reduced amplitude. Patients were disproportionately slow during flexion and in switching from flexion to extension. Movement slowness increased as finger oppositions progressed but predominantly when patients had to move fingers individually. In conclusion, in patients with Parkinson’s disease, the motor performance deteriorated with task completion more during individual than during nonindividual finger movements. Parkinson’s diseasetherefore, impairs individual finger movements more than gross hand movements. This distinction reflects the finer cortical control needed to promote and sustain this highly fractionated type of motor output...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the involvement of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) in testicular steroidogenesis of the green frog Rana esculenta {{and its effect on}} stimulation of <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> morphology and glandular activity, a typical testosterone-dependent secondary sexual characteristic in this amphibian species. In the testis, D-Asp concentrations vary significantly during the reproductive cycle: they are low in pre- and post-reproductive periods, but reach peak levels in the reproductive period (140 - 236 nmol/g wet tissue). Moreover, the concentrations of D-Asp in the testis through the sexual cycle positively match the testosterone levels in the gonad and the plasma. The racemase activity evaluated during the cycle expresses its peak when D-Asp and testosterone levels are highest, that is, during the reproductive period, confirming the synthesis of D-Asp from L-Asp by an aspartate racemase. Short-term in vivo experiments consisting of a single injection of D-Asp (2. 0 micro mol/g body weight) demonstrated that this amino acid accumulates significantly in the testis, and after 3 h its uptake is coupled with a testosterone increase in both testis and plasma. Moreover, within 18 h of amino acid administration, the D-Asp concentration in the testis decreased along with the testosterone titer to prestimulation levels. Other amino acids (L-Asp, D-Glu and L-Glu) used instead of D-Asp were ineffective, confirming that the significant increase in testicular testosterone was a specific feature of this amino acid. In long-term experiments, D-Asp had been administered chronically to frogs caught during the three phases of the reproductive cycle, inducing testosterone increase and 17 beta-estradiol decrease in the gonad during the pre- and post-reproductive period, and vice versa during the reproductive period...|$|E
40|$|During post-flight {{processing}} of STS- 116, damage to crewmember Robert Curbeam's Phase VI Glove Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment was discovered. This damage consisted of: loss of RTV- 157 palm pads on the thumb {{area on the}} right glove, a 0. 75 inch cut in the Vectran adjacent to the seam and <b>thumb</b> <b>pad</b> (single event cut), constituting the worst glove damage ever recorded for the U. S. space program. The underlying bladder and restraint were found not be damaged by this event. Evaluation of glove damage found that the outer Vectran fibers were sliced {{as a result of}} contact with a sharp edge or pinch point rather than general wear or abrasion (commonly observed on the RTV pads). Damage to gloves was also noted on STS- 118 and STS- 120. One potential source of EMU glove damages are sharp crater lips on external handrails, generated by micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts. In this paper, the results of a hypervelocity impact (HVI) test program on representative and actual ISS handrails are presented. These tests were performed in order to characterize impact damage profiles on ISS handrails and evaluate alternatives for limiting risk to future missions. It was determined that both penetrating and non-penetrating MMOD impacts on aluminum and steel ISS handrails are capable of generating protruding crater profiles which exceed the heights required for EMU glove abrasion risk by an order of magnitude. Testing demonstrated that flexible overwraps attached to the outside of existing handrails are capable of limiting contact between hazardous crater formations and crewmember gloves during extravehicular activity (EVA). Additionally, replacing metallic handrails with high strength, low ductility, fiber reinforced composite materials would limit the formation of protruding crater lips on new ISS modules...|$|E
