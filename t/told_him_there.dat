5|$|The Victorian was {{not called}} during the 1960–61 Australian season, but his {{performances}} were ineffective {{and he was}} repeatedly hampered by injuries. In particular, a strained achilles tendon restricted his speed and penetration, particularly in the lead-up to the opening Test. Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests, taking two wickets at 117.00 and scoring 12 runs at 6.00; {{he was unable to}} complete either match, sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures. These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three other Tests. During the summer, Meckiff's bowling was passed by Col Egar, who later ended his career. He noted that the umpire had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was little point in changing his action.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

25|$|Vic {{wanted to}} become a boxer at the age of 5 and dreamed of {{becoming}} a world champion in the professionals. His father <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was no professional boxing in Armenia (or any Soviet countries; this changed when the Union fell in 1991) and instead wanted Vic to follow in his footsteps and take up wrestling. Vic also wrestled as a kid, but always continued to say he would become a world champion someday. He eventually left wrestling in pursuit of his dream to become a world boxing champion.|$|E
25|$|Shanawdithit made ten {{drawings}} for Cormack, {{some of which}} showed parts of the island, and others illustrated Beothuk implements and dwellings, along with tribal notions and myths. As she explained her drawings, she taught Cormack Beothuk vocabulary. She <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> were far fewer Beothuk than twenty years previously. To her knowledge, {{at the time she}} was taken, only a dozen Beothuk survived. Despite medical care from the doctor William Carson, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis in Botwood on June 6, 1829. At the time there was no known cure for the disease.|$|E
25|$|It was Blue Byte's {{desire to}} improve upon any {{aspects of the}} first game which they felt didn't work which led to Thomas Häuser {{becoming}} project manager. When the first game was in development, Häuser was newly employed by Blue Byte, and had done quality assurance work on it. In this capacity, {{he had made a}} list of possible gameplay improvements for the developers, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was no time to implement his changes, as the game was almost ready for release. However, they had been impressed with his ideas, and, when the second game was greenlit, they suggested he apply his ideas to this game. This ultimately led to Häuser, a programmer by trade, working as the lead designer on the sequel.|$|E

500|$|When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992, they {{recruited}} {{a full-time}} replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph. Bostaph made one mistake {{out of the}} nine songs the band trialled him with, on [...] "Angel of Death". Before the [...] "big double bass part" [...] there is a lead section, which Bostaph could not understand, as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo. Bostaph could not tell how many revolutions the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence. The band members <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> were eight, [...] "perfecting" [...] the song afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes were}} {{cut from the}} final film; one lost scene {{entitled}} [...] "The Isles of Langerhans" [...] has the three teenagers trying to order in the French restaurant, shocked to discover pancreas on the menu (although in the finished film, Ferris still says, [...] "We ate pancreas", while recapping the day). This is featured on the Bueller, Bueller Edition DVD. Other scenes were never made available on any DVD version. These scenes included additional screen time with Jeanie in a locker room, Ferris' younger brother and sister (both of whom were completely removed from the film), and additional/alternate lines of dialogue throughout the film, {{all of which can}} be seen in the original theatrical trailer. Hughes had also wanted to film a scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to a strip club. Paramount executives <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> were only so many shooting days left, so the scene was scrapped.|$|E
500|$|Bodley {{spent his}} {{seven years in}} the Sahara desert living with a nomad Bedouin tribe. He {{purchased}} a herd of sheep and goats and used them {{as a source of}} income. He hired 10 shepherds to care for his flock, and consistently earned 120% on his investment. He wore Arab dress, spoke Arabic, practised the Muslim faith and abstained from alcohol; Bodley continued to be a non-drinker after leaving the Sahara. He left the tribe on the advice of its chief, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was no use in continuing to pretend to be an Arab. In 1927 he wrote Algeria from Within, after being encouraged to do so by publisher Michael Joseph. The book is based on his experiences living in French Algeria. The book's success greatly exceeded his expectations, prompting him to continue writing. His first novel, Yasmina, was published later that year; it sold well and was reprinted. His next novel, Opal Fire, published the following year, was a commercial failure, but this did not discourage him from continuing to write. Bodley regarded his time in the Sahara as [...] "the most peaceful and contented years" [...] of his life. He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara.|$|E

2500|$|Brugge {{was one of}} two {{children}} born to Oswald and Francis Brugge and raised in Jamestown, NY. Brugge's passion for research started when his third grade teacher <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> were many ruins in Mexico and people knew nothing about them. Upon [...] graduating from high school in 1945, he was drafted and served two years in the Army. [...] Brugge used the G.I. and attended University of New Mexico. After 3 years, he earned a BA in anthropology (1950).|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Watson began having headaches, {{which he}} {{described}} as [...] "like a knife being pressed into the bridge of my nose". He consulted a specialist, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was {{nothing to worry about}} as he was suffering from stress and should find ways of relaxing. When his peripheral vision began to be affected in late 2006, he visited another specialist, who also said he was suffering from stress. Watson told him, [...] "The only thing that's stressing me is this pain in my head." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{immediately}} afterward, Seán T. O'Kelly said {{he wished}} to associate the [...] "anti-treaty side" [...] in the Dáil with Griffith's sentiments. Speaking in Mullingar on 30 April, the Anti-Treaty leader Éamon de Valera condemned the killings. A general convention of Irish Protestant churches in Dublin released a statement:Apart from this incident, hostility to Protestants by reason of their religion, has been almost, if not wholly unknown, in the 26 counties {{in which they are}} a minority. However, a deputation of Irish Protestants who met with Winston Churchill in May 1922 <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was, [...] "nothing to prevent the peasants expropriating [...] every last Protestant loyalist" [...] and that they feared a repeat of the massacres that Protestants had suffered in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the 1798 Rebellion. Churchill remarked that the events were [...] "little short of a massacre".|$|E

2500|$|In the end {{the higher}} levels of the British {{political}} system decided against the urgings of their own Chiefs of Staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing A3T missile. This decision was made official late in 1973 by the Edward Heath administration, who changed the name from Super Antelope to Chevaline. The name 'Chevaline' {{was the result of}} a telephone call to London Zoo from an official at the Ministry of Defence. Prompted by a request for a name-change from his boss, the Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Carrington, the official asked the zoo to 'imagine an animal like a large antelope' and inquired whether there was such a beast. The zoo <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was a South African creature called a Chevaline, and the official 'thought that sounded rather good'. (The creature to which the zoo was probably referring was the Roan Antelope, Hippotragus equinus which is known in French as 'Antilope chevaline'.) ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{midnight on}} Saturday 8 February 1879, Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Hart and Byrne {{surrounded}} the Jerilderie police barracks. Constables George Denis Devine and Henry Richards were on duty that night. Hart, {{in a loud}} voice, shouted, [...] "Devine, there's a drunken man at Davidson's Hotel, who has committed murder. Get up at once, all of you." [...] Richards, who was sleeping {{at the rear of}} the premises, came to the front door. Devine opened the door, meeting Kelly who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was a great row at Davidson's. Devine approached Kelly, who once he established there were no other policemen, pointed two revolvers at the policemen, introduced the gang, telling the officers to hold up their hands. Immediately the police were pounced upon by the other men and placed in the lock-up cell, and Mrs Devine and children were held hostage in the sitting-room. Afterwards Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition and toured the house with Devine to make certain there were no other policemen. After this, he let her and the children turn in to sleep as usual, and with the rest of the gang went into the sitting room, where they kept watch till morning.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Tender wakes up; and Fertility {{tells him}} that she's pregnant. She then leaves for the airport to board a plane to Sydney, Australia. In her planner that she leaves behind, Tender reads that {{someone is going to}} hijack the plane and crash it into the Australian outback. [...] Following Fertility to the airport, Tender finds her, takes Adam's gun (which she has stashed in an urn purportedly {{containing}} her brother's cremated remains), and uses it to board the plane. He then begins searching for the [...] "real" [...] hijacker until the joke dawns on him and he realizes that he is the hijacker. The plot thus returns to the beginning, with Tender telling his life story. He mentions that Fertility <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> was a way for him to escape the plane before it crashes, but on the record, he can't seem to figure it out. [...] The book ends mid-sentence, but without any definitive answer as to whether Tender lives or dies. However, it has been stated by the author that Tender survives, and an explanation is available on Chuck Palahniuk's official website.|$|E

2500|$|Thompson and {{his crew}} {{witnessed}} an unarmed woman being kicked and shot at point-blank range by Captain Medina, who later claimed that he thought she had a hand grenade. Thompson then saw a group of civilians (again consisting of children, women, and old men) at a bunker being approached by ground personnel. Thompson landed and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the Vietnamese while {{he was trying to}} get them out of the bunker that they were to open fire on these soldiers. Thompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant (identified as Stephen Brooks of 2nd Platoon) and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> were women and children in the bunker, and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out. According to Thompson, [...] "he [...] said the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade". Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to [...] "just hold your men right where they are, and I'll get the kids out". He found 12–16people in the bunker, coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter, standing with them while they were flown out in two groups.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} the draft rights {{to high school}} player Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets by trading established center Vlade Divac. No NBA team had previously drafted a guard straight from high school. After freeing up salary by parting with other veteran players, they signed free agent All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal later that year. The two sparred in their first three seasons playing together from 1996–1999. [...] Bryant kept his teammates at a distance, answering non-basketball questions with one- or two-word responses. O'Neal told the Lakers when Bryant arrived, [...] "I'm not gonna be babysitting." [...] Bryant had extreme confidence in his ability, which was unusual for an 18-year-old. Some teammates interpreted Bryant's confidence as arrogance. O'Neal was wary of Bryant, as a rookie, boasting that he would lead the Lakers in scoring and be {{the best player in}} the league. Lakers general manager Jerry West criticized O'Neal's leadership for hazing Bryant that season. While O'Neal's personality was good-humored, Bryant's demeanor was all-business and was interpreted by some teammates as selfishness. O'Neal began calling Bryant showboat because of his flashy offensive moves. In an overtime playoff loss to the Utah Jazz that eliminated the Lakers, O'Neal fouled out with two minutes remaining in regulation. Lakers coach Del Harris had designed the Laker offense around the rookie Bryant, who went on to shoot four air balls. Harris explained that Bryant's one-on-one skills made him the best choice. After the game, O'Neal put his arm around Bryant and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>there</b> would be other opportunities. West said the team's shortcoming made O'Neal angry since he was going to be judged by the team's success.|$|E
