500|$|NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker {{announced}} at the annual Television Critics Association news tour in January 2003, that singer Madonna would be appearing in an episode of Will & Grace. On March 18, Madonna taped her appearance. While taping [...] "Dolls and Dolls", Madonna recalled {{the first time she}} made her way on the set, the studio audience [...] "cheered so hard" [...] that she had to make her entrance all over again. [...] "I had to wait too long <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>my</b> first line, so we had to do it over." [...] Madonna's role in the show made it her episodic television series debut. Her decision to do the show was due to her being a [...] "big fan". In an interview with the entertainment news program Access Hollywood, the singer revealed that her manager gave her tapes of the show to watch. She liked the show and called it [...] "hysterical" [...] with [...] "really good writing". She most enjoyed actress Megan Mullally's character Karen, and said she would do the show if her scenes were with her.|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an A– grade. In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "worthy", but {{noted that it}} was overshadowed by the show's [...] "ludicrous {{conspiracy}} plots". Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Release" [...] was a [...] "good episode" [...] because it [...] "presented conclusions to [...] long running stories in the series [...] featured the conclusion to John Doggett's personal trial, his quest for closure with his son's murder." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two argued that, because of the [...] "minimal emphasis" [...] Doggett's son's murder was given in the show, the episode [...] "packs [...] punch". Shearman and Pearson saw similarities between Doggett's trials and those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). They noted that while [...] "Mulder was always identified by his quest for his sister [...] ", Doggett [...] "carried {{the loss of his}} son as a private grief." [...] They concluded that this structuring made the entry [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] and [...] "moving". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, complimented the [...] "lyrical style" [...] of the episode, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot" [...] and [...] "well acted". Other reviews were not as glowing. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode made about as much sense as 'Underneath' or 'Jump the Shark'. It was entirely inappropriate for John Doggett’s struggle to end with someone else’s actions. If this is the way the series is going to end, then I have <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>my</b> hopes for a rousing finale are dwindling." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have {{something}} more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on <b>my</b> side," [...] he announced, {{bringing down the}} flat of {{his hand on the}} table with a bang. [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that if <b>my</b> son doesn't feel this insult, I do!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{is a great}} honor, and I {{shall not}} deny a great pleasure, to be your guest on this occasion. I am not gifted with the art of oratory, and am forced <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>my</b> thanks in plain and homely words. Yet they are none the less heartfelt. I make no pretense that the {{building}} of the Virginian Railway was intended wholly as a public service, and it is a business enterprise. I have faith that the resources of this Old Dominion State, when properly developed, mean a great deal, not for you who live here alone, but for the whole country." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{signing a}} five-year {{contract}} with producer Al Woods, Colbert played ingenue roles on Broadway from 1925 through 1929. During this period she disliked being typecast as a French maid. Colbert later said, [...] "In the very beginning, they wanted to give me French roles … That’s why I used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>my</b> name Col-bert {{just as it is}} spelled instead of Col-baire. I {{did not want to be}} typed as ‘that French girl.’" [...] She received critical acclaim on Broadway in the production of The Barker (1927) as a carnival snake charmer. She reprised this role for the play's run in London's West End. Colbert was noticed by the theatrical producer Leland Hayward, who suggested her for the heroine role in For the Love of Mike (1927), a silent film now believed to be lost. The film didn't fare well enough at the box-office.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike The Fame, the {{new album}} was {{inspired}} by the singer's personal experiences and brought the analysis of fame to an entirely new level. The album's early musical direction was also shaped by Gaga's touring experiences with The Fame Ball Tour, during which she allegedly encountered [...] "several monsters" [...] that encapsulated her biggest fears. These fears were divided into various monster metaphors, such as the [...] "Fear of Sex Monster", [...] "Fear of Love Monster", [...] "Fear of Alcohol Monster", and so forth. [...] "I spent a lot of nights in Eastern Europe," [...] the singer said. [...] "And this album is a pop experimentation with industrial/Goth beats, 90's dance melodies, an obsession with the lyrical genius of 80's melancholic pop, and the runway". She wrote new music while viewing muted fashion shows, [...] "I am compelled <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>my</b> music was scored for them." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that The Fame and The Fame Monster were like yin and yang because of their contrasting styles and concepts.|$|E

2500|$|A notable stylistic {{technique}} {{used in the}} adaptation is the multiple addresses direct to camera. For example, Henry's [...] "I know not what <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>my</b> title's weak" [...] (1.1.135), [...] "All will revolt from me, and turn to him" [...] (1.1.152), [...] "And I with grief and sorrow to the court" [...] (1.1.211), and [...] "Revenged may she be on that hateful Duke,/Whose haughty spirit, wing'd with desire,/Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh {{of me and my}} son" [...] (1.1.267–270); Exeter's [...] "And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all" [...] (1.1.274); the entirety of York's soliloquy in Act 1, Scene 4; Warwick's pause to get his breath during the Battle of Barnet (2.3.1–5); all of Act 2, Scene 5 (including dialogue from Henry, the father and the son) up to the entry of Prince Edward at line 125; all of Henry's monologue in Act 3, Scene 1, prior to his arrest (ll.13–54); Richard's entire soliloquy in Act 3, Scene 2 (ll.124–195); Margaret's [...] "Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,/For this is he that moves both wind and tide" [...] (3.3.47–48); Warwick's soliloquy {{at the end of the}} Act 3, Scene 3 (ll.257–268); Richard's [...] "I hear, yet say not much, but think the more" [...] (4.1.85) and [...] "Not I, my thoughts aim at a further matter:/I stay not for love of Edward but the crown" [...] (141.124–125); Warwick's [...] "O unbid spite, is sportful Edward come" [...] (5.1.18); the entirety of Richard's soliloquy in Act 5, Scene 6, after killing Henry (ll.61–93) and Richard's [...] "To say the truth, so Judas kissed his master/And cried 'All hail', whenas he meant all harm" [...] (5.7.33–34).|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>My</b> expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
