5|$|It's good <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> didn't see it coming. That's a {{big concern}} when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|As Sun He was intelligent, Sun Quan favoured him {{and often}} kept {{him by his}} side. Sun Quan also treated Sun He {{exceptionally}} well; he gave Sun He new clothes, ornaments, toys and other gifts, but did not {{do the same for}} his other sons. Sun Quan's subjects also highly regarded Sun He because he was not only bright, perceptive and well-versed in literary arts, horse-riding and archery, but also respectful and courteous towards his tutors and elders. He was genuinely interested in getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people.</b> In 247, Sun Quan ordered Zhuge Yi (諸葛壹) to pretend to defect to Wu's rival state, Wei, and lure the Wei general Zhuge Dan into a trap. When Sun Quan personally led the Wu forces to attack Zhuge Dan, Sun He showed grave concern about his father: he could not rest and have his meals in peace, repeatedly reminded his father to be careful, and hoped that his father would win the battle. He only put aside his worries upon seeing his father return safely to Wu.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One {{certainly}} gets <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> {{rather well}} in times like these,' said Jim, drily; but William's face was serene as ever, and, {{even as she}} prophesied, Scott did not appear.|$|E
5000|$|Ability <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people's</b> character. You must {{perceive}} {{evidence of}} characteristics from experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{never told}} me you name," [...] said Hewet suddenly. [...] "Miss Somebody Vinrace. [...] . I like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people's</b> Christian names." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Casting my eye {{over the}} accounts, I find that branch of {{business}} pays pretty fairly, and I am game for extending it. I like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people's</b> affairs likewise. So look out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had an idea}} {{it would}} be better fun. Everybody's so much more cheery in the second cabin. You get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> so much quicker. Nine trips out of ten, I'd much rather go second." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> {{really well}} {{while they are}} alive," [...] said Mr. Gingham; [...] "be friends with them, close friends {{and then when they}} die you don't need to worry. You'll get the order every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would have}} been duller still," [...] Netta laughed. [...] "I {{should have been a}} long time before I got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people,</b> and there is no good in knowing people when you are going right away from them in a short time, and may never meet them again." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'd Like <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> (Where <b>People</b> Go)" [...] - (Roy Drusky, Vic McAlpin) ...|$|R
5000|$|Do {{you want}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>people</b> expect {{when they come}} to church? ...|$|R
50|$|Arts, music, literature, gardening, cooking, {{travelling}} {{and adventure}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the <b>people</b> {{and culture of}} the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} him {{to show it to}} me," [...] she mused, smiling. [...] "Why, the boy is a born genius--and to think he should be a shore boy! I can't {{understand}} it. And here I am loving him already. Well, a woman has to love something--and you don't have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> for years before you can love them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{ought to}} have her chance. She ought indeed. I don't think you quite do your duty by such a girl as that unless you let her have a chance. She is sure to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people,</b> and to be asked from one house to another. I speak plainly, for I really {{think you ought to}} let her come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well; I expect {{one does}} not often get all one thinks to get. I wanted the {{cultivation}} Oxford might have given me; I wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> of your sort, who don't bother about business, but hunt and fish and shoot. Well, I can throw a dry-fly and hold a gun straight; but after all I'm Jimmy Leyland, from the mills in Lancashire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, you're rather dull. They didn't {{really want}} us; they wanted <b>to</b> fish. <b>To</b> <b>know</b> when <b>people</b> might be bored is useful." ...|$|R
60|$|SECRETARY--[With satisfaction.] Welcome to our city. Glad <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you <b>people</b> are {{waking up}} at last. We haven't got many members in your line.|$|R
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. It is {{very good}} {{for you to be}} in the way, and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>people</b> say of you behind your back.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> {{for some}} time before you {{understand}} them, but, on the whole, I imagine I'm harmless," [...] Foster replied. [...] "That's what makes it galling. If I had, for example, a part in some dark plot, I couldn't resent being watched. As it happens, I merely want {{to get as much}} innocent pleasure as possible out of a holiday, and feel vexed when people won't let me." ...|$|E
60|$|Cartwright {{thought she}} meant to be nasty. For one thing, Barbara had not gone to see her and perhaps had not urged her calling at the hotel. Ellen {{did not like the}} girl, but she wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> and Mrs. Cartwright had stopped at Las Palmas for some time. As a rule, Clara's friends were good. This, however, was not important. He must buy Ellen's shares before Arcturus arrived and the news of her salvage got about.|$|E
60|$|MURRAY (frowning). No. I haven't {{been able}} to get down to it--somehow. There's so little time to {{yourself}} once you get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> in New York. The sale of the stories you typed put me on easy street as far as money goes, so I've felt no need---- (He laughs weakly.) I guess I'm one of those who have to get down to hard pan before they get the kick to drive them to hard work.|$|E
50|$|Another {{significant}} contribution made by Jesse Bader to the evangelistic {{life of the}} churches was the religious census. Dr. Bader {{believed that it was}} essential <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people's</b> church preference. He was certain this needed to be obtained by churches working together visiting house to house. The technique he perfected required careful processes and months of preparation. The results, in a society that was becoming much more mobile, needed to be used quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{you ever}} send your work to exhibitions?" [...] I asked. [...] "I {{should have thought}} you'd like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>people</b> thought about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Christian," [...] murmured Greta, who was {{plaiting}} {{blades of}} grass, [...] "shall always want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>people</b> {{think about a}} future life; that is so funny!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just this: {{you place}} {{yourself}} {{in my hands}} from the moment we get ashore, and trust to me. You don't {{know anything about the}} land, anyway--you said so. And I 'll fix it with my father--I know I can--so that you can get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> of the right sort, and study and get an education, and be something else than a bay pirate or a sailor. That 's what you 'd like, is n't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "I don't {{suppose it was}} meant we should know what was in each other's minds. It would take a man {{out of his own}} hands. As long as he's in his own hands, there's some hopes of his doing {{something}} with himself; but if a fellow has been found out--even if he hasn't been found out to be so very bad--it's pretty much all up with him. No, sir. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> through and through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not much,' {{the other}} replied. 'At {{some of the}} summer resorts it might be done, but it could not last long. There ain't enough big towns and places to work in; besides, at our hotels there ain't the same chance of getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> that there is at home, or in Paris, or in those places. People sit down to a little table to {{themselves}} to their meals, {{and there is no}} sort of general meeting-place. You would find it very hard to work it. Got some money, I suppose?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Law {{professor}} Susan Estrich has said, “If {{you really}} want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>people</b> in America think, you can't find a smarter guy to ask than Scott Rasmussen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suddenly}} became very {{much interested in}} Miss Temple. 'Tell me why you do that,' I said. 'I always like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why <b>people</b> laugh at other people.' ...|$|R
50|$|United Nations Day {{is devoted}} <b>to</b> making <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> {{of the world}} the aims and {{achievements}} of the United Nations Organization. United Nations Day is part of United Nations Week, which runs from 20 to 26 October.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was pleasant. In {{spite of my}} uncertainty, {{it gave me a}} sense of pleased confidence to be in the Cheritons' company. I had taken to them at once: and the more I talked with them, the better I liked them. Especially Jack, that nice brotherly Jack, who seemed almost like an old friend to me. You get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> so well on a long railway journey. I was quite sorry to think that by five o'clock that afternoon we should reach Adolphus Town, and so part company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, child! Nature never makes a ferret in {{the shape}} of a mastiff. You'll never persuade me that I can't tell what men are by their outsides. If I don't like a man's looks, depend upon it I shall never like HIM. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> that look ugly and disagreeable, any more than I want to taste dishes that look disagreeable. If they make me shudder at the first glance, I say, take them away. An ugly, piggish, or fishy eye, now, makes me feel quite ill; it's like a bad smell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, never. What Sir Henry's views may be, I don't pretend <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>People</b> here do {{say that}} he has been ingratiating himself with my brother for some time past. He has my leave, Miss Gauntlet. I am an old man, old enough to be your father"--the well-preserved old beau might have said grandfather--"and my {{experience}} of life is this, that money is never worth the trouble that men take to get it. They say my brother is fond of it; if so, I think he has made a mistake in life--a great mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>people</b> are like," [...] Rachel remarked, and Helen saw with pleasure that she spoke more naturally. [...] "I suppose I was taken in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well! That's all I want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> If <b>people</b> {{apply for}} your character, that's your reason, stated by yourself. You go in {{consequence}} of the breaking up of the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who in {{the name}} of common sense is Mr. Baxter?" [...] asked the Master of the House. [...] "I like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who <b>people</b> are when I am being told what they do." ...|$|R
