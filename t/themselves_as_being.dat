5000|$|Freire {{believed}} education {{could not}} be divorced from politics; the act {{of teaching and learning}} are political acts in themselves.

Freire believed that [...] "education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>beings</b> capable of knowing—of knowing that they know and knowing that they don't".|$|R

This disruption opens the way for different possibilities and lines of flight that characters and narrators pursue in the following chapters, breaking up thematic coherence to challenge the notion of beginnings and endings as the only genres that provide meaning and closure to experience, particularly to the experience of writing...|$|R

The findings highlight how the embedded authority and associated moral accountability of adults in relation to children militate against recognising children's moral agency...|$|R
