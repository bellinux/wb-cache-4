5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid <b>that</b> <b>smells</b> similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E

25|$|All mosques have rules {{regarding}} cleanliness, {{as it is}} {{an essential}} part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as wudu. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something <b>that</b> <b>smells,</b> such as garlic.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid <b>that</b> <b>smells</b> like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nirvana's success, Michael Azerrad wrote in a 1992 Rolling Stone article, Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a {{spokesman}} for a generation." [...] Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an [...] "anthem-of-a-generation" [...] status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. The New York Times observed <b>that</b> <b>Smells</b> Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation’s version of the Sex Pistols' 1976 single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.', if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title," [...] and added, [...] "As Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, shrink-wrapped and sold." [...] The band grew uncomfortable with the song's success, and in later concerts often pointedly excluded it from the set list. Prior {{to the release of}} the band's 1993 follow-up album In Utero, Novoselic remarked, [...] "If it wasn't for 'Teen Spirit' I don't know how Nevermind would have done," [...] and observed, [...] "There are no 'Teen Spirits' on In Utero." [...] Cobain said in 1994, [...] "I still like playing 'Teen Spirit,' but it's almost an embarrassment to play it [...] Everyone has focused on that song so much." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Cobain's 1994 death and the band's breakup, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] has continued to garner critical acclaim, and is now often listed {{as one of the}} greatest songs of all time.

[...] The song was placed at number six in NMEs [...] "Global Best Song Ever Poll" [...] in 2005. In the 2006 VH1 UK poll The Nation's Favourite Lyric, the line [...] "I feel stupid and contagious/Here we are now, entertain us" [...] was ranked as the third-favorite song lyric among over 13,000 voters. VH1 placed [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] at number one on its list of the [...] "100 Greatest Songs Of The '90s" [...] in 2007, while Rolling Stone ranked it number ten on its list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time". In 2009, the song was voted number one for the third time in a row on the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in Australia (it was first place previously in 1991 and 1998). That same year, VH1 ranked the song seventh on its list of the [...] "100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs". Despite previously proposing in its 2006 entry for Nevermind on [...] "The All-TIME 100 Albums" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Smells</b> Like Teen Spirit' [...] may be the album's worst song," [...] Time magazine later included it on its list of [...] "The All-TIME 100 Songs" [...] in 2011.

2500|$|In September 2011, Crabapple {{was living}} in a studio near Zuccotti Park. [...] Occupy Wall Street protesters had begun to use the Park as a camp to stage their movement, artists began {{creating}} posters and Crabapple decided to contribute work and engage in the movement. [...] "Before Occupy I felt like using my art for activist causes was exploitive of activist causes," [...] she told the Village Voice. [...] "I think what Occupy let me do was it allowed me to instead of just donating money to politics or just going to marches, it allowed me to engage my art in politics." [...] Artists and journalists who had {{come from all over the}} world to report on the protests were using Crabapple's apartment as an [...] "impromptu salon" [...] for the Occupy movement. In Discordia (2012), British journalist Laurie Penny remembered how [...] "Occupy Wall Street had set up camp two streets away from Crabapple's apartment in Manhattan and we'd just spent a sleepless week documenting arrests. [...] Molly perched at her desk churning out protest posters and handing them to activists to copy and wheat-paste all over the financial district...After three days, the word went out that there was an apartment near the protest camp where you could find hot drinks, basic medical attention and a place to charge your gadgets and file copy. The flat became a temporary sanctuary for stray activists and journalists" [...] "I started doing protest posters," [...] Crabapple recalled. [...] "And in doing these, I found my voice." [...] Author Matt Taibbi called Crabapple [...] "Occupy's greatest artist", [...] noting the use of the [...] "vampire squid" [...] theme in her Occupy artwork. [...] Crabapple, a fan of Taibbi's writing, had read his 2009 Rolling Stone article, [...] "The Great American Bubble Machine". [...] In the article, Taibbi referred to Goldman Sachs as [...] "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything <b>that</b> <b>smells</b> like money." [...] When Crabapple used Taibbi's metaphor as a stencil depicting a vampire squid and released it for anyone to use, it went viral throughout the Occupy movement.|$|E
