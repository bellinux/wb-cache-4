5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen,</b> for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E

5000|$|There are locally Hausdorff spaces where a {{sequence}} {{has more than}} one limit. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> never <b>happen</b> for a Hausdorff space.|$|R
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> at any depth.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
50|$|Negative present copula {{is often}} {{inserted}} {{before or after}} the predicate. This particular copula usually contains the main stress of the intonation group. <b>This</b> phenomenon <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> {{in the middle of a}} predicate phrase.|$|R
25|$|Mask and {{regulator}} clearing may {{be needed}} to ensure ability to see and breathe in case of flooding. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>happen</b> and is not considered an emergency.|$|R
2500|$|Solutions to the diseconomies {{of scale}} for large firms may involve {{splitting}} the company into smaller organisations. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> either <b>happen</b> by default {{when the company}} is in financial difficulties, sells off its profitable divisions and shuts down the rest; or <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> proactively, if the management is willing.|$|R
25|$|Layout: where {{a player}} extends his body {{horizontally}} towards the disc, ending up {{lying on the}} ground usually. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> offensively to catch a far or low disc, or defensively to hit the disc and force a turnover.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand general {{elections}} {{occur when the}} Prime Minister requests a dissolution of Parliament and therefore a general election. Theoretically, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> at any time, although a convention exists whereby Prime Ministers do not call early elections unless they have no reasonable alternative.|$|E
25|$|As {{seen in the}} Acid {{deposition}} section, {{nitric oxide}} can transform into nitrogen dioxide (<b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> with the hydroperoxy radical, HO2•, or diatomic oxygen, O2). Symptoms of short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure include nausea, dyspnea and headache. Long-term effects could include impaired immune and respiratory function.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{neurotransmitter}} molecule binds to a receptor molecule, it must {{be removed}} {{to allow for the}} postsynaptic membrane to continue to relay subsequent EPSPs and/or IPSPs. <b>This</b> removal <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> through one or more processes: ...|$|R

25|$|Overtorquing {{might cause}} failure by {{damaging}} the threads and deforming the fastener, though <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> over {{a very long}} time. Undertorquing can cause failures by allowing a joint to come loose, and it may also allow the joint to flex and thus fail under fatigue.|$|E
25|$|The now-reduced {{mediator}} {{exits the}} cell laden with electrons that it transfers to an electrode; this electrode becomes the anode. The {{release of the}} electrons recycles the mediator to its original oxidised state, ready to repeat the process. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> only under anaerobic conditions; if oxygen is present, it will collect the electrons, as it has greater electronegativity.|$|E
5000|$|Under statute the {{requirement}} is employer's [...] "conduct" [...] allowing the employee to [...] "terminate without notice"; as <b>this</b> <b>can</b> only <b>happen</b> with a repudiatory breach {{it amounts to}} the same thing.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> process <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> in {{a master}} STB (even as an {{addition}} to conventional receiver operation), in a distribution device analogous to an IF multiswitch positioned close to the antenna, or even at the antenna itself in the LNB (an IP-LNB).|$|R
50|$|They {{usually have}} similar root causes as head-on collisions, {{but no other}} vehicle {{happened}} to be in the path of the vehicle leaving its lane. Severe collisions of <b>this</b> type <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> on motorways, since speeds are extra high, increasing the severity.|$|R
25|$|Some synthetases also mediate a editing {{reaction}} to ensure high fidelity of tRNA charging. If the incorrect tRNA is added (aka. the tRNA {{is found to}} be improperly charged), the aminoacyl-tRNA bond is hydrolyzed. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> when two amino acids have different properties even if they have similar shapes—as is the case with Valine and Threonine.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, females {{choose not}} to {{struggle}} and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> when they decide {{that the cost of}} resisting would be greater than the cost of mating. They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury. This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons.|$|E
25|$|The reflector, {{made out}} of vapourised {{aluminum}} deposited in an extremely thin layer on a metal, glass or plastic substrate, can become dirty, oxidised, or burnt, and lose its specularity. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> if water enters the headlamp, if bulbs of higher than specified wattage are installed, or simply with age and use. Reflectors thus degraded, if they cannot be cleaned, must be replaced.|$|E

25|$|Species such as {{shellfish}} that occupy intermediate trophic levels often play a dual role, both filtering organic bottom-level organisms {{from the}} water and generating some ammonia. Waste feed may also provide additional nutrients; either by direct consumption or via decomposition into individual nutrients. In some projects, the waste nutrients are also gathered and reused in the food given to the fish in cultivation. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> by processing the seaweed grown into food.|$|E
25|$|Another {{assumption}} is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter. This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen,</b> for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered. Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} hazards in {{operation}} of recovery boilers is the smelt-water explosion. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> if even {{a small amount of}} water is mixed with the solids in high temperature. Smelt-water explosion is purely a physical phenomenon. The smelt water explosion phenomena have been studied by Grace. By 1980 there were about 700 recovery boilers in the world. The liquid - liquid type explosion mechanism has been established as one {{of the main}} causes of recovery boiler explosions.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{function}} of θ this is a two-sided Laplace transform of h(X), and cannot be identically zero unless h(x) is zero almost everywhere. [...] The exponential is not zero, so <b>this</b> <b>can</b> only <b>happen</b> if g(x) is zero almost everywhere.|$|R
