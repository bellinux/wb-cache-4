5|$|The {{book was}} written {{in the context of the}} natural {{theology}} tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence and goodness of God from the general well-being of living <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> physical world.|$|E

In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

25|$|He {{inferred}} {{that persons}} desiring to train this faculty (of memory) must select places and form mental {{images of the}} things they wish to remember and store those images in the places, so that the order of the places will preserve the order of the <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> images of the things will denote the things themselves, and we shall employ the places and the images respectively as a wax writing-tablet and the letters written upon it.|$|E
25|$|Dee was {{influenced}} by the Hermetic and Platonic-Pythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the Renaissance. He believed that numbers were the basis of all <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> key to knowledge. From Hermeticism, he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power, and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics. His ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the Catholic and Protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients.|$|E

25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns {{to the question of}} accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E

Erik asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there was nothing to blame Erik for but that he had got the old <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he was no less the Swedish king's man than the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Erik had no other choice but to slay the impudent and treacherous Åke.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} to {{be drawn}} from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source. Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via Averroes, came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance, and they remain important in Iranian philosophy.|$|E

25|$|The second series premiered on E4 on 11 March 2008, {{however the}} first episode was {{available}} in four parts to MySpace users prior to airing. 'Maxxie and Tony' starts the series, showcasing Tony's impairments following his accident and Maxxie's involvement to his recovery. The episode also reveals more about Maxxie's life; we learn of his ambitions to be a dancer, his surname, his difficulties with homophobic bullies, and encounter his parents (played by Bill Bailey and Fiona Allen). The second episode introduces a new character in Maxxie's stalker, young carer Lucy, also known as 'Sketch'. Sketch disrupts the school play organised by drama lecturer Bruce (Shane Richie) to steal a kiss from Maxxie. To spite Maxxie, Sketch begins {{a sexual relationship with}} Anwar. Episode three focuses on Sid's life, coping with Cassie's departure to Scotland, and he suspects her of cheating. Sid's Scottish relatives visit. Sid's father, Mark, stands up to his own father's abuse and ultimately reconciles his relationship with Sid; allowing for the unforeseen, peaceful death of Mark. Sid reconnects with brain-damaged Tony when he is able to open up to him about his father's death. For 'Michelle', the group go on a camping trip to a beach. Maxxie discovers Sketch having sex with Anwar, and Sid sleeps with Michelle, starting a relationship; he comes home to find Cassie waiting for him. In 'Chris', Chris agrees to start a job and Jal learns to start being more open to new <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two end up in a relationship. Chris cheats on her with Angie after Cassie tells Chris that Jal left him, but they move back in together, and Jal discovers she is pregnant.|$|E

[...] It is the guiding principle of the universe, [...] "operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> totality which embraces all existence."

IGN said {{that there is a}} bulk of pressure involved with developing the sequel to a game from a different developer which won several [...] "Game of the Year" [...] awards, and that Obsidian delivered. The review also said that it won't disappoint fans of the original game and that it is mostly similar to it in terms of the model. GamePro praised both the first and second Knights of the Old Republic and said that the second game continues the series' tradition of not fixing what is not broken. GameSpot echoed this statement, also saying that both the good <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shortcomings from the first game are present in Knights of the Old Republic II.|$|E
500|$|Chrysippus {{taught that}} ethics {{depended}} on physics. In his Physical Theses, he stated: [...] "for {{there is no}} other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> administration of the universe." [...] The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature. A person's individual nature is part {{of the nature of the}} whole universe, and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe. Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly. People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason. Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.|$|E
