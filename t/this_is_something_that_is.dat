25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> usually not found in written language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between a master and a clever servant is also a common element in Elizabethan comedy. [...] Shakespeare often includes foils for his characters to have one set off the other. In Elizabethan romantic comedy, {{it is common for}} the plays to end with multiple marriages and couplings of pairs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not seen in Plautine comedy. In the Comedy of Errors, Aegeon and Aemilia are separated, Antipholus and Adriana are at odds, and Antipholus and Luciana have not yet met. At the end, all the couples are happily together. By writing his comedies in a combination of Elizabethan and Plautine styles, Shakespeare helps to create his own brand of comedy, one that uses both styles.|$|E

Exile from the place is a change and a complete departure, and all things, when they depart from their natural place ... are unsustainable in the place that is not natural to them, until they return to their natural place. For if they were to remain in the place that is unnatural to them, what was unnatural to them would become natural, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not possible, for the unnatural to become natural.” ...|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} various {{instances}} {{in the media}} about how the Muslim community are often misrepresented to society, mostly {{in a way that}} centers heavily on terrorism, and paints Islam with a very broad brush. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> seen in two major magazines, Newsweek and Time, which have been covering relations between the U.S. and Afghanistan over the last decade. Both of these publications distributed twenty leading articles that depicted about 57% of negative coverage in regards to current events in Afghanistan, while only around 6% was positive information. This negative content would often consist of excessive mentioning of Al-Qaida and the Taliban, mistreatment of women, the recruitment of terrorists, etc. These are in fact very real occurrences that are present {{in this part of the}} world, but primarily focusing on activities of radical groups could lead others to develop a one sided view of Islam.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to a request from to the Canadian Press, researchers from the University of California, Irvine released results of new air-quality tests in 2015 from Alberta's Industrial Heartland. The team visited the AIH in July 8 to 12, 2012, their third visit. The peer-reviewed 2013 publication based on samples taken during their 2008 and 2010 visits, [...] "found smog-causing chemicals at levels comparable to — and occasionally many times higher than — some of the world's largest cities and industrial complexes." [...] Although the new tests revealed that the spikes of concentrated toxic plumes were short-lived, Donald Blake, {{the head of the}} Nobel-prize-winning lab, remarked that, [...] "These are the kinds of numbers we don't see in Los Angeles... If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> blowing at somebody's house, and they're getting five to 20 parts per billion of benzene at them all the time ... that starts to worry me." ...|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} of Chávez's death, {{speculation}} about potential Chavista reactions to his death were compared to the sorrow felt by those in North Korea who mourned the death of Kim Jong Il, with one scholar of Latin America from the University of California Santa Barbara, Juan Pablo Lupi, stating {{that the creation of}} Chávez's cult of personality was [...] "very well-staged, all this process of myth-making and appealing to the feelings and religious sentiment of the people. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> quasi-religious". Lupi's explanation of Chávez's cult of personality was similar to those of Juan Carlos Bertorelli, a marketing company creative director in Caracas and Larry Birns, the director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. Carlos Bertorelli stated that the Bolivarian government created a cult of personality surrounding Chávez in order to [...] "maintain a presence that legitimizes them" [...] while Birns stated that [...] "For many in the movement, Chavez, or the movement of the Chavistas towards a religious stance, is less a matter of faith than {{it is a matter of}} strategy".|$|E
50|$|The hacker ethic {{deals with}} the idea that {{individuals}} are performing a duty for the common good, an analogy to a modern day 'Robin Hood'. The hacker communities as a result are prided on {{the fact that they are}} the rebellion against authority figures that restrict this level of computer freedom. Hackers are only judged by their ability as opposed to the various systems in places that currently dictate authority, such as schools and universities. Mostly the hacker ethic idealizes the notion of hacking being an art-form, something revered as opposed to disputed and frowned upon. Popularized by 'phreakers' in the 1970s and 1980s, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not only evident, but also widespread among the growing community. As Manuel Castells, another lecturer involved in the field of computing, it is something that reflects not only on this community, but also of the wider social, political and financial world. In a sense, hacking is something that should affect everyone, but it is whether or not the interpretation that is given to hackers by Steven Levy compared with negative stereotypes of the media that dictate this perception.|$|E
