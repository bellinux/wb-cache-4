50|$|Many freeband {{operators}} use amateur radios modified <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>out</b> of band, {{which is}} illegal in some countries. Older amateur radios may require component changes; for instance, the 1970s Yaesu FT-101 was modified for CB by replacing {{a set of}} crystals used to tune portions of the 10-meter band, although some variants of the FT-101 were sold with the US FCC channels standard and were capable of transmitting {{above and below the}} legal 40 channels by another 10 or more channels. On some newer radios, the modification may be as simple as disconnecting a jumper wire or a diode. Many types of amateur transceivers may be found on CB and freeband, ranging from full-coverage HF transceivers to simpler 10-meter mobile radios. In the United States, the FCC bans the importation and marketing of radios it deems easily modifiable for CB; it is illegal to transmit on CB frequencies with a ham radio except in emergencies where no other method of communication is available.|$|E
5000|$|During the Malayan conflict, {{there were}} {{instances}} during operations to find insurgents where British troops detained and tortured villagers who were suspected of aiding the insurgents. Brian Lapping {{said that there}} was [...] "some vicious conduct by the British forces, who routinely beat up Chinese squatters when they refused, or possibly were unable, to give information" [...] about the insurgents. Besides that, the British troops cut off the communist and guerrillas' heads, the reason was easy <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>out</b> from jungle for identifying use and published in the British Daily Worker on May 1952. There were also cases of the bodies of dead guerrillas being exhibited in public， whether male or female. They insulted the died bodies and threatened their families or villagers. Moreover, sent the detainee into exile. From 1948, June 18 till 1950, April 15,there have 35,000 people sent into exile, included the people who cannot left the country. The Scotsman newspaper lauded these tactics as a good practice since [...] "simple-minded peasants are told and come to believe that the communist leaders are invulnerable". British forces also booby-trapped jungle food stores, burned villages and secretly supplied self-detonating grenades and bullets to the insurgents to instantly kill the user. Some civilians and detainees were also shot, either because they attempted to flee from them {{on the grounds that they}} could give the insurgents valuable assistance to continue to fight against British forces or simply because they refused to give intelligence to British forces. These tactics created strained relations between civilians and British forces in Malaya and were therefore counterproductive in generating the one resource critical in a counterinsurgency, good intelligence. British troops were often unable to tell the difference between enemy combatants and non-combatant civilians while conducting military operations through the jungles, due to the fact the guerrillas wore civilian clothing and had support from the sympathetic civilian populations.|$|E

Following the project approach, the starting phase consisted of prototyping a layer conveying preservation metadata, which can be encoded from the existing archival systems, and exchanged with other repositories. This layer called Preservation Metadata Layer (PML) uses PREMIS semantics as the common language to overcome archival systems differences, and <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>out</b> of its original context, relevant preservation information about content objects comprising an AIP. Since a repository, following the OAIS reference model, usually provides resources with metadata container objects, the experiment performed an analysis on commonly used container formats, in order to enable the traceability of semantics from a local to extra-local level, and the technological understandability of alien AIPs. The analysis has allowed {{the definition of a}} PML data model, laying the production of prototypes. The adoption of common semantics, like PREMIS, supports the opportunity of preserving correctly alien AIPs, coming from different technological environments, and hopefully enables the overcoming of obstacles to the interoperability among diverse archival systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A coding problem, over {{a slotted}} system, is intro-duced where the sender has <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> one <b>out</b> of several packets to the receiver, but learns the request {{only at the}} {{beginning}} of each slot with prior statistical information about which packet is needed at the receiver. There is an associated cost of sending bits at each slot, and the goal is to minimize the expected cost of the communication. A proactive coding scheme is proposed, where the source proactively communicates with the receiver before the receiver requests the message. This way, by designing a cost optimal side information at the receiver, the scheme is able to minimize the expected cost of the communication. Numerical results are provided demonstrating the gains obtained by proactive coding over the conventional coding technique. I...|$|R
40|$|Spectral element {{method is}} very {{efficient}} in modelling high-frequency stress wave propagation because {{it works in}} the frequency domain. It {{does not need to}} use very fine meshes in order to capture high frequency wave energy as the time domain methods do, such as finite element method. However, the conventional spectral element method requires a throw-off element {{to be added to the}} structural boundaries to act as a conduit for energy <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>out</b> of the system. This makes the method difficult to model wave reflection at boundaries. To overcome this limitation, imaginary spectral elements are proposed in this study, which are combined with the real structural elements to model wave reflections at structural boundaries. The efficiency and accuracy of this proposed approach is verified by comparing the numerical simulation results with measured results of one dimensional stress wave propagation in a steel bar. The method is also applied to model wave propagation in a steel bar with not only boundary reflection, but also reflections from single and multiple cracks. The reflection and transmission coefficients, which are obtained from the discrete spring model, are adopted to quantify the discontinuities. Experimental tests of wave propagation in a steel bar with one crack of different depths are also carried out. Numerical simulations and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and reliable in modelling wave propagation in one-dimensional waveguides with reflections from boundary and structural discontinuities. The proposed method can be applied to effectively model stress wave propagation for structural damage detection...|$|E

An increasing number of critical services are using the Internet for daily operation. However, not all users on the Internet are good guys. Thus, security becomes more important nowadays. Furthermore, wireless links are more subject to various attacks. There are some security considerations that may affect our approach. First of all, malicious users may forge signaling messages to modify binding information. This may cause a serious security problem. We discuss the authentication problem in Section 4.1. Secondly, ingress filtering has been proposed to filter unauthorized source IP addresses <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Internet. Packets issued by the MN may be filtered out if its source IP address is HoA in the MIP and proposed MRT approach. We discuss the ingress filtering strategy in Section 4.2.

We discuss the ICMP attack problem in Section 4.3.|$|R

Wave shape analysis in the spike sorting procedure provides a means to detect neural modulation while minimizing the influence of noise (false alarms). As neural recording techniques allow for recording 100 s of electrodes, power is too limited in neural implants for current spike sorting algorithms. Even with spike sorting at the back-end where more power is available, the bandwidth is too limited <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> enough information <b>out</b> for current spike sorting techniques.

In the present FEL, the millimeter-wave radiation generated in the resonator is separated from the electron beam by means of a perforated Talbot effect reflector. A quasi-optic delivery system transmits the out-coupled power through a window in the pressurized gas accelerator tank into the measurement room (in the previous configuration, radiation was transmitted through the accelerator tubes with 40 dB attenuation). This makes it possible <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> useful power <b>out</b> of the accelerator and into the user laboratories.

40|$|International audiencePhages play {{critical}} {{roles in}} the spread of virulence factors and control of bacterial populations through their predation of bacteria. An essential step in the phage lifecycle is genome entry, where the infecting phage must productively interact with {{the components of the}} bacterial cell envelope in order <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> its genome <b>out</b> of the viral particle and into the host cell cytoplasm. In this study, we characterize this process for the Escherichia coli phage HK 97. We have discovered that HK 97 genome injection requires the activities of the inner membrane glucose transporter protein, PtsG, and the periplasmic chaperone, FkpA. The requirements for PtsG and FkpA are determined by the sequence of the phage tape measure protein (TMP). We also identify a region of the TMP that mediates inhibition of phage genome injection by the HK 97 superinfection exclusion protein, gp 15. This region of the TMP also determines the PtsG requirement, and we show that gp 15 -mediated inhibition requires PtsG. Based on these data, we present a model for the in vivo genome injection process of phage HK 97 and postulate a mechanism by which the inhibitory action of gp 15 is reliant upon PtsG...|$|R
