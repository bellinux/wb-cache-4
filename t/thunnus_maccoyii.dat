40|$|This study {{examined}} the postprandial metabolism and swimming speed of southern bluefin tuna <b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii</b> when fed sardines Sardinops sagax of either high-lipid and high-energy content or low-lipid and low-energy content. Five groups {{of two or three}} T. maccoyii (mean+/-s. e. mass= 19. 8 +/- 0. 5 kg, n= 14) were fed either low [2. 2 % lipid, 5. 5 MJ kg(- 1) gross energy (GE) ] or high-lipid (12. 9 %, 9. 2 MJ kg(- 1) GE) S. sagax. Before feeding, T. maccoyii swam at 0. 74 +/- 0. 03 body lengths s(- 1) (n= 5) and their routine metabolic rate was 305 +/- 15 mg kg(- 1) h(- 1). Swimming speed and metabolic rate of T. maccoyii increased following feeding. <b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii</b> swam 1. 3 and 1. 8 times faster during digestion of low and high-lipid S. sagax, respectively. Postprandial peak metabolic rate, duration of elevated metabolism and total postprandial metabolic increment were all greater for T. maccoyii that ingested high-lipid S. sagax. When total postprandial increment is represented as a proportion of ingested energy, {{there was no difference between}} high and low-lipid meals, equating to between 30 and 35 % of ingested energy. It was estimated that increased postprandial swimming costs account for 25 and 46 % of the total postprandial metabolic response for low and high-lipid S. sagax meals, respectively. Specific dynamic action (SDA) accounts for c. 20 % of ingested energy regardless of S. sagax lipid level. These results confirm that the postprandial metabolic increment of T. maccoyii is greater than most other fish species. Much of the high cost of postprandial metabolic increment can be attributed to increased postprandial swimming costs. For T. maccoyii, it appears that activity and SDA are not independent, which complicates bioenergetic evaluation. High postprandial metabolic costs accentuate the great energetic requirements of T. maccoyii. Q. P. Fitzgibbon and R. S. Seymou...|$|E

40|$|The {{bluefin tuna}} {{have a variety}} of {{distinctive}} anatomical and physiological adaptations that enhance performance. However, our understanding of bluefin tuna physiology is limited by the logistical difficulties of studying these large pelagic fish. This thesis examines some aspects of the metabolic physiology of the southern bluefin tuna. It provides insight into the high-performance, high-energy demand physiology of bluefin. It also examines the metabolic physiology of the mulloway, another important aquaculture species for which physiological information is currently limited. 1. Routine metabolic rate (RMR) of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii),</b> the largest tuna specimens studied so far (body mass = 19. 6 kg (± 1. 9 SE)) was measured in a large (250, 000 l) flexible polypropylene respirometer “mesocosm respirometer”. Mean mass-specific RMR was 460 mg kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ (± 34. 9) at a mean water temperature of 19 °C. When total RMR is added to published values of other tuna species at equivalent swimming speeds, there is a strong allometeric relationship with body mass (654 • Mb ⁰·⁹ ⁵, R ² = 0. 97). This demonstrates that interspecific RMR of tuna scale with respect to body mass similar to that of other teleosts, but is approximately 5 -fold higher than the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of other active teleost species. 2. This study reports on the first measurements of the metabolic cost of food digestion and assimilation (specific dynamic action, SDA) of a tuna species. Oxygen consumption (MO₂) and swimming velocity of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii)</b> were elevated for periods between 20 - 45 h (longest for the largest rations) post-ingestion of sardines (Sardinops sagax). It is suggested that the purpose of increased swimming velocity was to increase ventilation volume {{as a response to the}} enhanced metabolic demand associated with SDA. The magnitude of SDA as a proportion of gross energy ingested (SDA coefficient) averaged 35 ± 2. 2 %. This demonstrates that the absolute energetic cost of SDA in SBT is approximately double that recorded in other teleost species. 3. This study examines the effects of sardines (Sardinops sagax) with high- (12. 9 %) or low- (1. 8 - 4. 0 %) lipid level on specific dynamic action (SDA) and swimming velocity of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii).</b> Fish swam faster during the SDA period with the increase in velocity being greatest for the fish that ingested the high-lipid sardine. Magnitude of SDA was also greater for fish that ingested the high-lipid sardines. However, the energetic cost of SDA as a proportion of ingested energy was not significantly different between fish that ingested the high- (34. 3 ± 2. 4 %) and low-lipid sardines (31. 5 ± 2. 9 %). These results confirm that the high energetic cost of SDA is ecologically relevant. 4. In this study the metabolic and behavioural responses of both fasted and postprandial southern bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii,</b> SBT) to low dissolved oxygen (DO) was examined. In moderate hypoxia (4. 44 and 3. 23 mg l⁻¹), swimming velocity (U) and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of fasted fish was mildly enhanced. At 2. 49 mg l⁻¹, U increase to over double in the normoxic speed, possibly as an escape response. At 1. 57 mg l⁻¹, both U and RMR were suppressed and SBT failed to survive the entire 20 h exposure period. This reveals that SBT are remarkably well adapted to low DO. Feeding did not greatly influence their hypoxia tolerance. In a subsequent experiment there were no significant differences in U, RMR and gastric evacuation rates of postprandial SBT in hypoxia (2. 84 mg l⁻¹) compared to those in normoxia (7. 55 mg l-¹). 5. In this study, 768 h of simultaneous recordings of metabolic rate (MR, = heat production) and visceral temperature were made in both fasted and postprandial southern bluefin tuna (SBT, <b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii)</b> of two sizes (~ 10 and 20 kg) and at two water temperatures (~ 19 and 16 °C). Duration and magnitude of specific dynamic action (SDA) were strongly related to duration and magnitude of postprandial visceral warming providing the first empirical evidence of a link between SDA and postprandial visceral warming. Visceral temperature of fasted SBT was also directly related to MR. In this case, source of heat is thought to be metabolic work performed within the red muscles which warmed the viscera through thermal conductance. Visceral excess temperatures were over 1 °C warmer in larger than smaller SBT. Better heat retention ability of the larger SBT is likely attributed to improved retia mirabilia development and greater thermal inertia. SBT at 16 °C maintained visceral excess temperatures significantly warmer than similarly sized fish at 19 °C. This demonstrates some ability of SBT to physiologically regulate visceral warming. 6. In this study, the effect of progressively severe hypoxia levels on the swimming performance and metabolic scope of juvenile mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) were investigated. In normoxic conditions (6. 85 mg l⁻¹), standard metabolic rate (SMR) and cost of transport were typical for subcarangiform fish species. Mulloway had a moderate scope for aerobic metabolism (5 times the SMR). The critical dissolved oxygen level was 1. 80 mg l⁻¹ revealing that mulloway are well adapted to hypoxia. In all levels of hypoxia (5. 23, 3. 64, and 1. 86 mg l⁻¹) the active metabolic rate was reduced however, the critical swimming velocity was reduced only at 3. 64, and 1. 86 mg l⁻¹. Mulloway metabolic scope was significantly reduced at all hypoxia levels, suggesting that even mild hypoxia may reduce growth productivity. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{recently}} developed radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measuring insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) {{in a variety}} of fish species was used to investigate the correlation between growth rate and circulating IGF-I concentrations of barramundi (Lates calcarifer), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Southern Bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii).</b> Plasma IGF-I concentration significantly increased with increasing ration size in barramundi and IGF-I concentration was positively correlated to growth rates obtained in Atlantic salmon (r 2 = 0. 67) and barramundi (r 2 = 0. 65) when fed a variety of diet formulations. IGF-I was also positively correlated to protein concentration (r 2 = 0. 59). This evidence suggested that measuring IGF-I concentration may provide a useful tool for monitoring fish growth rate and also as a method to rapidly assess different aquaculture diets. However, no such correlation was demonstrated in the tuna study probably due to seasonal cooling of sea surface temperature shortly before blood was sampled. Thus, some recommendations for the design and sampling strategy of nutritional trials where IGF-I concentrations are measured are discusse...|$|E

The data can potentially be used to construct a time-series index of relative abundance by standardising the data for issues such as weather, spotter ability and ocean conditions. Unlike a statistically designed survey, the commercial spotting is governed by business considerations and fishing operations. The SBT dataset is therefore highly unbalanced with regard to spotters operating in each season.

To illustrate this example of successful use of tagdata in management, we review the appropriate biology of SBT and its’ interaction with the fishery, the management challenge that tagging and the habitat model helped resolve, and how this approach has been implemented. Discussion of the management costs associated with this management system shows that fine-scale spatial management is a suitable approach for this bycatch issue.

40|$|Germ cell {{transplantation}} is an innovative {{technology for the}} production of interspecies surrogates, capable of facilitating easier and more economical management of large-bodied broodstock, such as the bluefin tuna. The present study explored the suitability of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) as a surrogate host for transplanted southern bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii)</b> spermatogonial cells to produce tuna donor-derived gametes upon sexual maturity. Germ cell populations in testes of donor T. maccoyii males were described using basic histology and the molecular markers vasa and dead-end genes. The peripheral area of the testis was found to contain the highest proportions of dead-end-expressing transplantable Type A spermatogonia. T. maccoyii Type A spermatogonia-enriched preparations were transplanted into the coelomic cavity of 6 – 10 -day-old post-hatch S. lalandi larvae. Fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the presence of tuna cells in the gonads of the transplanted kingfish fingerlings at 18, 28, 39 and 75 days after transplantation, indicating that the transplanted cells migrated to the genital ridge and had colonised the developing gonad. T. maccoyii germ cell-derived DNA or RNA was not detected at later stages, suggesting that the donor cells were not maintained in the hosts’ gonads...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ‘Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing’, or ‘IUU fishing’, {{is among the}} most pressing challenges confronting fisheries scientists, managers, and conservationists in the twenty-first century. IUU fishing is an activity which seeks to avoid official monitoring and for which a deficient of reliable information often exists, yet global studies of its extent suggest that it may have accounted for as much as 20 % of the world’s marine capture harvest in the final two decades of the twentieth century. This chapter considers IUU fishing from the historians’ perspective. It provides a short history of IUU fishing, locating the phenomenon in the global expansion of marine capture fisheries and the changes to the regulation of fishing industries and control over maritime space and marine living resources that took place during the twentieth century. Three case-studies of IUU fishing from the Indo-Pacific are examined in detail: the Southern Ocean fishery for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides); the presence of Indonesian fishers in the Australian Fishing Zone; and Japanese under-reporting of Southern Bluefin Tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii)</b> catches. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the potential for further investigations of IUU fishing from an historical perspective...|$|E
40|$|Southern {{bluefin tuna}} (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>Maccoyii)</b> {{is a global}} {{resource}} which is critically endangered. The Committee for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) sets commercial quota levels for member nations, including Australia, each year. However, southern bluefin tuna is also a popular “trophy” fish with recreational anglers {{and the size of}} the total recreational catch in Australia is unknown but thought to be significant. This study focuses on the recreational southern bluefin tuna catch at Portland, in southwest Victoria and is based on data collected during the 2010 fishing season. The results indicate that the size of the recreational catch at Portland is significant in terms of the management of the fishery. A travel cost study was undertaken to estimate the recreational value of the fishery. The on-site recreational use value (consumer surplus) per person per visit is estimated to be between $ 33 and $ 132 and the on-site annual recreational use value of the fishery for this one season is estimated to be between $ 449, 533 and $ 1, 325, 124.

40|$|Scuticociliates are {{opportunistic}} protozoan pathogens {{present in}} a wide range of teleost hosts. Uronema spp. and Miamiensis spp. are the two most common genera recorded from scuticociliatosis cases in farmed and ornamental fish. Southern bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii)</b> (SBT) ranching is a high value aquaculture sector, situated off Port Lincoln, South Australia. Uronema nigricans has been previously associated with SBT swimmer mortality syndrome and was considered to be the causative agent. We conducted the first molecular characterisation of swimmer syndrome agent from affected SBT. Comparison of SSU rDNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 sequences from the cerebrospinal fluid from SBT affected by swimmer syndrome and Uronema marinum samples, and phylogenetic analyses identified the scuticociliate present in SBT samples as Miamiensis avidus. Bayesian Inference analyses of both partial gene sequences of the Port Lincoln isolates form a clade with known M. avidus to the exclusion of Uronema spp. This shows that M. avidus is associated with swimmer syndrome and is present in the environment around SBT leases. Based on our molecular data, there is no evidence of Uronema spp. presence in the infected SBT. This is the first time M. avidus has been documented in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture is {{providing}} an ever-increasing proportion {{of fish in}} the human food basket prompting a search for new species to expand the range available to consumers. Large tunids/scombrids have long-since been a very valuable resource providing not only high quality protein, but also {{a rich source of}} the highly beneficial omega- 3 (or n- 3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic and, especially docosahexaenoic acids in the human diet. Consequently, there is considerable interest worldwide in developing the culture of large tunids, including Atlantic northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), southern bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii)</b> and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Nutrition is vital to this development, playing key roles in reproductive success, including the establishment of successful broodstock producing high quality eggs and larvae, and ultimately the cost-effective production of nutritious seafood. This review summarises the rather fragmentary data that compromise the current state-of-the-art in relation to tuna nutrition and the development of artificial, formulated feeds for these species. In highlighting the various considerable challenges that feed development will pose, we discuss the future perspectives for tuna culture in terms of both fish and human nutrition and welfare, against the background of diminishing global marine resources...|$|E
40|$|Electronic tagging {{provides}} unprecedented {{information on}} the habitat use and behaviour of highly migratory marine predators, but few analyses have developed quantitative links between animal behaviour and their oceanographic context. In this paper we use archival tag data from juvenile southern bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>maccoyii,</b> SBT) to (i) develop a novel approach characterising the oceanographic habitats used throughout an annual migration cycle {{on the basis of}} water column structure (i. e., temperature-at-depth data from tags), and (ii) model how the vertical behaviour of SBT altered in relation to habitat type and other factors. Using this approach, we identified eight habitat types occupied by juvenile SBT between the southern margin of the subtropical gyre and the northern edge of the Subantarctic Front in the south Indian Ocean. Although a high degree of variability was evident both within and between fish, mixed-effect models identified consistent behavioural responses to habitat, lunar phase, migration status and diel period. Our results indicate SBT do not act to maintain preferred depth or temperature ranges, but rather show highly plastic behaviours in response to changes in their environment. This plasticity is discussed in terms of the potential proximate causes (physiological, ecological) and with reference to the challenges posed for habitat-based standardisation of fishery data used in stock assessments...|$|E
