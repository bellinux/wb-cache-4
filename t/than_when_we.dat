500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} over Andrew Lincoln's performance. Despite citing {{that his}} accent was [...] "dodgy", Pierce lauded Lincoln's acting. [...] "his body language and expression here is totally different now <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> saw him before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert {{referred to his}} accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Souter {{began his}} dissenting opinion with a {{detailed}} description of the religious message of Wide Awake magazine. [...] "Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes good on the editor's promise, and echoes the Apostle's call to accept salvation [...] [...] [...] The masthead of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation, that the hour has come for you to awake from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first believed". Example articles about eating disorders and racism, began with a secular perspective, but soon became religious messages decrying racism, and proclaiming that Jesus Christ alone can [...] "provide the ultimate source of spiritual fulfillment which permeates the emotional, psychological, and physical dimensions of our lives. This writing is not merely descriptive examination of religious doctrine," [...] nor is it [...] "merely the expression of editorial opinion that, incidentally, coincides with Christian ethics and reflects a Christian view of human obligation. It is straightforward exhortation to enter into a relationship with God, as revealed in Jesus Christ, and to satisfy a series of moral obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ." ...|$|E

The magazine included Balance of Power in its list of [...] "Our Favorite Games", calling it [...] "an impressive recreation of the world's geopolitical landscape ... call one too many bluffs and you'll see the chilling message You have ignited a nuclear war". Orson Scott Card, however, wrote in his review of the game that Crawford—"the best designer of simulation games I've seen"—was [...] "leaning over your shoulder and bullying you into playing the game his way. He has a sweet delusion {{that as long as the}} United States is very nice and doesn't do anything to offend them, the Russians will go home. And if you don't play that way, why, he'll stop the game with a nasty remark about how the world was just destroyed by nuclear war". He added that since no nuclear war had been fought Crawford could not know what would cause one, and [...] "there are a lot of experts who claim that the Soviets seem to behave a lot nicer when we stand up to them <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> disarm", but that [...] " [...] is so sure he's right that Balance of Power isn't a game, it's propaganda".|$|E
