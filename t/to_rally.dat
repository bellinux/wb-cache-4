5|$|In 1928, the Supreme Muslim Council held a mass {{demonstration}} involving {{both local}} Muslims and Christians at the Great Mosque in order <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> support for boycotting elections {{and participation in}} the Legislative Assembly of the British Mandate of Palestine government. To {{increase the number of}} people in the rally, they ordered all the mosques in one of Gaza's quarters to temporarily close.|$|E
5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> support.|$|E

5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on September 13, 1964, {{the ruling}} {{military}} junta of South Vietnam, led by General Nguyễn Khánh, was {{threatened by a}} coup attempt headed by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, who sent dissident units into the capital Saigon. They captured various key points and announced over national radio {{the overthrow of the}} incumbent regime. With the help of the Americans, Khánh was able <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties.|$|E
5|$|Enver Pasha {{conceived}} {{an expedition}} to Afghanistan in 1914. He envisioned it as a pan-Islamic venture directed by Turkey, with some German participation. The German delegation to this expedition, chosen by Oppenheim and Zimmermann, included Oskar Niedermayer and Wilhelm Wassmuss. An escort of nearly a thousand Turkish troops and German advisers was to accompany the delegation through Persia into Afghanistan, where they hoped <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> local tribes to jihad.|$|E

5|$|Following the loss, seniors on the {{football}} team held a players-only meeting in an effort <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> the team. Players later recalled that meeting as the turning point in the team's season. The next week, Virginia Tech earned its first win of the season, a 49–27 victory over East Carolina in Lane Stadium. The Hokies followed that by traveling to Boston College for a 19–0 win, their first shutout since 2006.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the speech}} given by Charles de Gaulle on the Appeal of 18 June 1940, Aubame {{sided with the}} Free French, and in November was sent by Libreville {{authorities}} <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> Fangs for the cause. In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator Félix Éboué and quickly became his protégé. He served as an informant for Éboué on African affairs. Aubame's reward was {{to be one of}} several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 Éboué appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of Brazzaville.|$|E
5|$|Hulagu {{departed}} for Karakorum and left Kitbuqa, a Nestorian Christian general, {{to continue the}} Mongol conquest. Damascus capitulated after {{the arrival of the}} Mongol army, but was not sacked like other captured Muslim cities. However, from Gaza, an-Nasir Yusuf managed <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> the small garrison he left in the Citadel of Damascus to rebel against the Mongol occupation. The Mongols retaliated by launching a massive artillery assault on the citadel and when it became apparent that an-Nasir Yusuf was unable to relieve the city with a newly assembled army, the garrison surrendered.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} {{political}} career, he joined numerous political committees with a left-wing orientation, {{such as the}} American Veterans Committee. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and supported Helen Gahagan Douglas in 1950 when she was defeated for the Senate by Richard Nixon. It was his realization that Communists were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> his friends against them.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{strategic}} {{plans for a}} decisive battle with the U.S. fleet were already established by September 1944. Anticipating the various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational order, code named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking U.S. supply vessels rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> the troops behind Sho.|$|E
5|$|Nixon won the Republican {{primary and}} Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also {{finishing}} {{third in the}} other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> to Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E
50|$|He turned later <b>to</b> <b>rallying,</b> and {{his best}} result was winning the Spanish Rally Championship in 1979 and 1981 with a Lancia Stratos HF. He retired from motor sport in 1982.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Propaganda {{was used}} by both sides <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> {{domestic}} support and demonize enemies during the First World War. PR activists entered {{the private sector in}} the 1920s. Public relations became established first in the US by Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays, then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe after 1948 when they created European subsidiaries {{as a result of the}} Marshall plan.|$|E

In {{the aftermath of}} the attempted coup, purges took place in Monrovia and in Nimba County, Quiwonkpa's home, against those who had rejoiced after the coup announcement. As many as 1,500 people may have been killed. The AFL was purged of Gio soldiers.|$|E
5|$|When Khánh {{heard of}} his ouster, he {{declared}} {{it to be}} illegal. After defying his colleagues and travelling {{around the country for}} a day in a fruitless attempt <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> support for a comeback, Khánh went into exile after being named to fill the meaningless post of Ambassador-at-Large and allowed an elaborate ceremonial military send-off to save face. Phát and Thảo were later sentenced to death in absentia. Thảo was hunted down and killed in July 1965, while Phát remained on the run for several years before turning himself in and being pardoned.|$|E

A wounded Pulaski was carried {{from the field of}} battle and taken aboard the South Carolina merchant brig privateer Wasp, under the command of Captain Samuel Bulfinch, where he died two days later, having never regained consciousness. His death, perceived by American Patriot supporters as heroic, further boosted his reputation in America.|$|E
