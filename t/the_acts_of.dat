5|$|Anne (6 February 1665 – 1 August 1714) became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland on 8 March 1702. On 1 May 1707, under <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union, {{two of her}} realms, the kingdoms of England and Scotland, united as {{a single}} {{sovereign}} state known as Great Britain. She continued to reign as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death.|$|E
5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After {{the coming of the}} Mongols to the Western world, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers convinced themselves that they had found him in Ethiopia.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh {{had emerged}} as the capital in the fifteenth century. It was the wealthiest and largest city in the kingdom and held the central law courts, {{parliament}} and royal residence at Holyrood Palace. After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union 1800, {{the royal}} arms were amended, {{dropping}} the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet. In 1816, after the Electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet {{was changed to}} a crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned {{a packed}} Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, {{and announced that}} no restraint could legally {{be put on the}} king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{provisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Uniformity 1662 were modified {{and partly}} revoked by <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Uniformity Amendment <b>Act</b> 1872.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> series <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> {{relating}} to this district, beginning with <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> March 23, 1804, {{and ending with}} <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> July 7, 1838, 5 Stat. 282, as revived and continued in force by later acts, are to be construed together, and as if the third section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> March 23, 1804, had been repeated in every <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|R
25|$|Before 1898, {{there were}} several {{short-lived}} federal bankruptcy laws in the U.S. The first was <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1800 which was repealed in 1803 and followed by <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1841, which was repealed in 1843, and then <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1867, which was amended in 1874 and repealed in 1878.|$|R
5|$|In 1707, <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union merged England and Scotland, and Lismore {{became part}} of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Thereafter taxes on whisky {{distillation}} rose dramatically, and much of Scotland's distillation was either shut down or forced underground until the 1823 Excise Act provided a legal framework for the industry. The remains of at least two illicit stills from this period have been found on Lismore.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles, Gaza is {{mentioned}} as {{being on the}} desert route from Jerusalem to Ethiopia. The Christian gospel was explained to an Ethiopian eunuch along this road by Philip the Evangelist, and he was baptised in some nearby water.|$|E
5|$|Like her brother, Berenice was {{a client}} {{ruler of the}} parts of the Roman Empire that lie in the present-day Syria. <b>The</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles records that during this time, Paul the Apostle {{appeared}} before their court at Caesarea.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an opinion}} written by Justice Swayne, The Supreme Court agreed with Springer that <b>the</b> recital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Congress in <b>the</b> deed was incorrect, and that <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Congress dated [...] "July 1, 1862" [...] {{had not been}} amended on March 30, 1864. The Court stated that the statute in {{question}} was actually <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> June 30, 1864 (see Revenue <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1864), as amended by <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> March 3, 1865. The Court rejected Springer's argument that <b>the</b> 1864 <b>Act</b> did not authorize the sale by the tax collector.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Uniformity 1551 (5 & 6 Edw 6 c 1), {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Uniformity 1552, was an <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parliament of England.|$|R

5|$|On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, {{argued that}} her client had {{not in fact}} {{committed}} <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> hooliganism in the church as she was prevented from accessing the soleas by church security. The court appeared to accept this argument, and released Samutsevich on two years' probation. However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their convictions and sentences.|$|E
5|$|We {{take this}} {{opportunity}} of expressing our anxiety, least, by too great indulgence to the wishes of counsel, questions of this sort should be frequently brought before this Court, and thus, in effect, an appeal in criminal cases become an ordinary proceeding to the manifest obstruction of public justice, and against the plain intendment of <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> Congress.|$|E
5|$|What {{little is}} known about her life and {{background}} comes mostly from the early historian Flavius Josephus, who detailed a history of the Jewish people and wrote an account of the Jewish Rebellion of 67. Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Aurelius Victor and Juvenal, also tell about her. She is also mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles (25:13, 23; 26:30).|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, to beget a {{child is}} <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> a living body, but devils cannot bestow life upon the bodies they assume; because life {{formally}} proceeds only from the soul, and <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> generation is <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical organs which have bodily life. Therefore bodies which are assumed in this way cannot either beget or bear.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Uniformity 1548 (2 & 3 Edw 6 c 1), also {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Uniformity 1549, was an <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parliament of England, passed on 21 January 1549.|$|R
5|$|After Anne's accession, {{the problem}} of the {{succession}} re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the Act of Security 1704, threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union 1707, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.|$|E
5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or {{the figure of the}} judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century statuary were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, {{the basic}} {{political}} system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. There {{has not been a}} government of England since 1707, when <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union 1707, putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.|$|E
5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union of the Crowns of England, Ireland and Scotland in 1603, the Royal Banner of {{the arms}} of the kings of Scotland was {{incorporated}} into the royal standards of successive Scottish then, following <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Union in 1707, British monarchs; with all such royal standards being quartered to include the banner {{of the arms}} of each individual realm. Since 1603, the Royal Banner of Scotland has appeared in both the first and fourth quarters of the quartered royal standard used in Scotland, while appearing only {{in the second quarter of}} that version used elsewhere.|$|E
