The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports <b>that</b> <b>require</b> endurance, strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of major}} {{internal}} changes in phpng, it must receive a new {{major version number}} of PHP, rather than a minor PHP 5 release, according to PHP's release process. Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng <b>that</b> <b>require</b> backward-compatibility breaks, including wider use of exceptions, reworking variable syntax to be more consistent and complete, and the deprecation or removal of various legacy features.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rapid}} rate of human {{expansion}} throughout the range of this species, bites are relatively common. Domestic animals and livestock are frequent victims. In Great Britain, most instances occur in March–October. In Sweden, there are about 1,300 bites a year, with an estimated 12% <b>that</b> <b>require</b> hospitalisation. At least eight different antivenoms are available against bites from this species.|$|E
5|$|Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, {{introduced}} in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio features <b>that</b> <b>require</b> HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form. This capability allows for an AV receiver {{with the necessary}} decoder to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 can transfer Blu-ray discs at full video quality.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes <b>that</b> <b>require</b> a {{cofactor}} but do {{not have}} one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E

The Gemara {{concluded that the}} manna fell in different forms for different classes of people: For the righteous, it fell as bread; for average folk, it fell as cakes <b>that</b> <b>required</b> baking; and for the wicked, it fell as kernels <b>that</b> <b>required</b> grinding.|$|R
5|$|More recent models {{attempt to}} model bubble dynamics, also usually by {{simplified}} models, {{to facilitate the}} computation of tables, and later to allow real time predictions during a dive. Models that approximate bubble dynamics are varied.

5|$|Natural {{decomposition}} of the shale into smaller fragments can affect slope stability, necessitating shallower slopes <b>that</b> <b>require</b> more material be disturbed in {{cut and fill}} work, exacerbating the acid rock drainage problem. The cut material cannot be used as fill beneath roads and structures due to volumetric expansion, compounding the problem. The Tioga ash beds contain bentonite clay which presents a landslide hazard in the unexcavated rock as well.|$|E

This is especially important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports <b>that</b> <b>require</b> large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries <b>that</b> <b>require</b> physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries <b>that</b> <b>require</b> the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government.

Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment <b>that</b> <b>require</b> extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
