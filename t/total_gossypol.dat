40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{gossypol}} contents of cottonseed cakes (CSC), prepared from different varieties of cotton {{grown in the}} Punjab province of Pakistan, were determined. For this purpose, cottonseed cake samples were collected from 14 districts of the Punjab including Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Jhang, Kasur, Khanewal, Lahore, Multan, Okara, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Toba Tek Singh and Vehari. These samples were analyzed for the free and the <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> contents applying American Oil Chemist Society Official Methods, Ba 7 - 58 and Ba 8 - 78, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} free and the <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> contents of cottonseed cakes averaged 0. 28 ± 0. 02 and 1. 44 ± 0. 04 per cent, respectively. The highest values of the free and the <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> contents, 0. 36 ± 0. 02 and 1. 59 ± 0. 03 per cent respectively, were recorded in cottonseed cake samples collected from Vehari district, while the lowest values, 0. 21 ± 0. 01 and 1. 29 ± 0. 01 per cent respectively, were found in those collected from Lahore district. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences (P< 0. 05) in the free and the <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> contents of cottonseed cakes among districts. It was concluded that the free and the <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> contents of cottonseed cakes available {{in different parts of the}} province differed significantly (P< 0. 05...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Plasma {{and tissue}} {{concentrations}} of total, (+) - and (−) -gossypol were determined in broilers fed cottonseed meals (CSM) from eight oil mills (five ex-pander solvent, two expeller, and one direct solvent). Free gossypol in the meals ranged from 0. 033 to 0. 180 %, and <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> ranged from 0. 974 to 1. 459 %. The (+) -en-antiomer of gossypol varied from 53. 8 to 61. 3 % of <b>total</b> <b>gossypol.</b> Eight CSM diets containing 28 % CSM and a soybean meal control diet were fed to 162 1 -d-old male broiler chicks during a 3 -wk starter period. Concentra-tions of free gossypol in the CSM diets ranged from 92 to 504 µg/g, and <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> ranged from 2, 626 to 4, 085 µg/g.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine effects of feeding whole cottonseed (WCS), expander solvent cottonseed meal (CSM), {{or a combination of}} these, as well as other factors on blood gossypol concentrations in cattle. In an 84 d trial, lactating cows were fed zero, 900 or 1800 ppm <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> (TG) in diets from WCS and/or CSM. Plasma gossypol (PG) in cows receiving 1800 ppm TG plateaued at 3. 28 μg/ml after 28 d. However, by 28 d, erythrocyte fragility increased for cows receiving WCS diets. Plasma chemistry, vitamin A, body temperatures, and respiration rates were within normal ranges. Serum vitamin E levels increased with cottonseed in diets. Milk yield and FCM higher (P < 0. 05) for cows fed 13. 5 % WCS and 7 % CSM diet than controls. Feed efficiency and milk fat and protein percentages were not influenced by diets. In another study, young Holstein steers were fed diets during five consecutive treatment periods of 28 d each. The following was shown: (1) A basal diet with 15 % Upland WCS resulted in average TG intakes of 9. 08 g/d. (2) When varying concentrations of dietary iron (5 treatments) were fed with 15 % WCS, PG and plasma <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> response (PG/TG intake) decreased as iron in diets increased. (3) Five diets with 15 % cottonseed in the whole, cracked, roasted, roasted and cracked, or extruded forms showed that roasting or excluding WCS reduced FG in seed up to 86 %. The PG concentration was higher (P < 0. 05) for the whole and cracked diets, but plasma <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> response (PTGR) increased over controls for the cracked and roasted treatments. (4) When varying amounts of WCS and CSM (6 treatments) were fed up to 14 and 9 % of the diet, respectively, PG concentration was higher (P for diets with 14 % than 7 % WCS. The PTGR was not affected by CSM supplementation for the 7 % WCS treatments. (5) When feeding of four diets with 15 % cottonseed as whole Upland, cracked Upland, whole Pima, or cracked Pima seed, PG and PTGR were higher for the Pima than Upland diets. Performance for the 28 d periods was not altered by treatments...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} five practical diets {{in which}} 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % (dietary treatments 1 – 5) of fish meal protein {{was replaced by}} solvent-extracted cottonseed meal protein.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} is critical information for product quality and exploration of new use. Hence defatted cottonseed meals from both glanded (with gossypol) and glandless (without gossypol) cotton seeds were separated into water soluble and insoluble fractions, or water soluble, alkali soluble {{as well as}} total protein isolates. The contents of <b>gossypol,</b> <b>total</b> protein and amino acids, fiber and carbohydrates, and selected macro and trace elements in these products were determined and compared {{with each other and}} with those of soy meal products. Data reported in this work improved our understanding on the chemical composition of different cottonseed meal products that is helpful for more economical utilization of these products. These data would also provide a basic reference for product standards and quality control when the production of the cottonseed meal products comes to pilot and industrial scales...|$|R
40|$|Karkade {{defatted}} flour extracts has chymotrypsin inhibitor activity almost {{half that of}} trypsin (21. 8 and 40. 5 enzyme inhibitor activity units/mg protein, respectively). The protein isolate has a weak chymotrypsin inhibitor activity {{compared to that of}} tryprin (4. 9 - 28. 3 enzyme inhibitor activity units/mg protein, respectively). The trypsin inhibitor activity of the protein isolate was 70 % of that of the {{defatted flour}} extracts. Extraction of trypsin inhibitor by citrate buffer (pH 7. 6), Trisbufer (pH 9. 0), or distilled water. Heating the extract in boiling water for 10 min destroyed 66. 1 % of the trypsin inhibitor activity. Karkade protein isolate had lower free and <b>total</b> <b>gossypol</b> than did the whole seen and defatted flour.

40|$|Simultaneous {{reactions}} of aniline on the aldehyde groups and ammonium molybdate on the ortho-diphenolic groups of gossypol were studied in tartaric acid buffer solution. The results {{indicated in the}} range 300 - 520 nm that the spectrum of dianilino-dimolybdate of gossypol complex obtained presents two peaks of absorption at 340 and 450 nm whereas the dianilino-gossypol and the dimolybdate of gossypol present one peak at 444 and 420 nm, respectively. The pH effect on {{the intensity of the}} absorption indicated that the optimum pH was 6. 5. Gossypol is the only compound in the cottonseed extract having two peaks of absorption in the range 300 - 520 nm. The calibration curve was linear over the range 0. 634 - 4. 953 ppm (r 2 = 0. 9949) with the detection limit of 0. 474 ppm. The stability of the complex was 90 min.

40|$|Gossypol, a {{polyphenol}} compound {{produced by}} cotton plant, has proven reproductive toxicity, but {{the effects of}} gossypol on sheep ovaries are unknown. This study was aimed to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of gossypol on the ovarian follicles of sheep. This trial was divided into two experiments. In the first one, we used twelve non-pregnant, nulliparous, Santa Inês crossbred ewes, which were randomly distributed into two equal groups and fed diets with and without cottonseed cake. Feed was offered at 1. 5 % of the animal's body weight for 63 days. The concentrations of <b>total</b> and free <b>gossypol</b> in the cottonseed cake were 3. 28 mg/g and 0. 11 mg/g, respectively. Throughout the trial period, no animal showed clinical signs of toxicity and no effects on body weight were observed. However, there was a significantly lower number of viable ovarian follicles (20. 6 %) and higher number of atretic follicles (79. 4 %) in the gossypol-fed sheep compared to the control (85. 1 and 34. 9 %, respectively). These findings were observed at all stages of follicular development. In the second experiment, eight ovaries from slaughterhouse were cultured with different concentrations of gossypol acetic acid (0, 5, 10 and 20 μg/mL) for 24 hours or seven days. The in vitro action of gossypol resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} viable ovarian follicles, especially the primary and transition follicles, and {{a significant increase in the}} number of atretic follicles after 24 hours of culture. These follicles were greatly affected when cultured with gossypol for seven days. It is concluded that gossypol present in cotton seeds directly acts on ovarian follicles in sheep to increase atresia...|$|R
40|$|Cotton seed meal (CSM) is an {{alternative}} ingredient in poultry diets but its use is limited due {{to the presence of}} gossypol and the potential effects of gossypol on digestibility of nutrients. Glandless cottonseed is available and contains very low gossypol but there has been a limited amount of poultry nutritional studies completed with glandless cottonseed meal (GCSM). The TMEn, proximate analysis, amino acid content and amino acid (AA) digestibility of a glandless (GCSM) and a commercial (CCSM) cottonseed meal were determined with broilers. Thirty 42 -day old Cobb 500 male broilers were precision-fed 30 g of CCSM, GCSM and glucose and excreta collected during a 48 h period. Glucose was fed to serve as a control (no nitrogen or AA content). The chemical composition, gossypol content, True metabolizable energy (TMEn) and digestibility coefficients for AA were calculated for both meals. The crude protein and fat content of GCSM was higher than the CCSM (54 and 51 %, 6 and 2 %, respectively). Both meals were similar in calcium, total phosphorus and phytic acid contents. The CCSM had a higher content of <b>total</b> and free <b>gossypol</b> (1. 52 and 0. 161 %, respectively) when compared to GCSM (0. 02 and. 003 %, respectively). The TMEn for the GCSM provided approximately one thousand kcal more per energy/ kg than the CCSM. The essential AA content (g/kg; 90 % DM) was determined for both cottonseed meals and was generally higher for GCSM compared to CCSM but both types of CSM contained higher levels of key essential AA than reported values for AA in the literature. The most extreme differences were for methionine and cystine; % methionine content was approximately 2 fold higher than values in the literature and the % cystine was 74 to 93 % higher. The true digestibility coefficients for essential AA ranged from the low of 73. 9 % for isoleucine to 91. 8 % for arginine, for CCSM; the amino acid digestibility coefficients for GCSM were all higher than 90 % for the essential AAs...|$|R
