5|$|Though she had {{originally}} hoped {{to publish the}} book during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, in which US President Bill Clinton was discovered {{to have had a}} sexual relationship with a White House intern, the research took several years longer <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> initially planned. The book was finally released in 2006 by Doubleday and Three Leaves Press in hardback, paperback, and e-book editions.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E
5|$|Pritzker was {{a member}} of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. She also served on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Although she was less active in the 2012 Obama {{campaign}} <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been four years prior, she served as national co-chair of Obama for America 2012. She was also on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank focused on world affairs and U.S. foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write more personal columns <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ever been before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|Connections among Coolbrith's {{circle of}} friends {{resulted}} in a librarian job at San Francisco's Mercantile Library Association in 1898, and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco. In January 1899, artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which Keith and Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia, a book of poems by Daniel O'Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been earning in Oakland, but her duties were light enough {{that she was able}} to devote a greater proportion of her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis's The Land of Sunshine magazine. As a personal project, she began to work on a history of California literature.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was a {{standout}} among her peers. In her {{first season as}} a soloist at New York City Center, in which avant-garde ballets works were performed, she received good notices in The New York Times for a Balanchine Ballo della Regina role. Also in 2007, she created {{a leading role in}} C. to C. (Close to Chuck), choreographed by Jorma Elo to A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close, Études 2, 9 & 10, by Philip Glass. Her performances of Tharp's works in the same season were recognized, and she was described as more sophisticated and contemporary as a soloist <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been as a corps dancer. Her summer 2008 Metropolitan Opera House (the Met) season performances in Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty were also well received.|$|E

5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main derrick and boat equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment. Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E

5|$|Since Woman of the Year, Hepburn had {{committed}} to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less {{for the remainder of}} the decade <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter-weekend 1945.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Mesopotamians worshipped Ishtar as {{the goddess}} of both warfare and sexuality.

She was portrayed as young and impetuous, constantly striving for more power <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been allotted.|$|E
25|$|Reelected in 2002, she led {{the statewide}} Republican ticket in terms of raw votes.

Storm even noted after Sinister's defeat that Spider-Man's unconventional attitude made him more like Wolverine <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> acknowledged.|$|E
