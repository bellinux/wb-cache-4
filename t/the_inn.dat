5|$|Many noted barristers, {{judges and}} {{politicians}} {{were members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> during this period, including Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls, Edmund Pelham, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and Francis Bacon, who served as Treasurer for eight years, supervising significant changes to the facilities of <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> and the first proper construction of the gardens and walks for which <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> is noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> a year. This fall in numbers was {{partly because the}} landed gentry were no longer sending sons who {{had no intention of}} becoming barristers to study at <b>the</b> <b>Inn.</b> In 1615, 13 students joined <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.|$|E
5|$|Farther south, Tyrion and {{his small}} retinue stop {{to spend the}} night at <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> at the Crossroads. There he recognizes Lady Catelyn Stark in disguise.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery or Hospida Cancellarie were a {{group of}} {{buildings}} and legal institutions in London initially attached to <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court and used as offices for the clerks of chancery, from which they drew their name. Existing from at least 1344, <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> gradually changed their purpose, and became both the offices and accommodation for solicitors (as <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court were to barristers) and a place of initial training for barristers.|$|R
50|$|Bars in {{the town}} include <b>the</b> Tower <b>Inn,</b> <b>the</b> Keepers Arms, <b>The</b> Brigg <b>Inn,</b> <b>The</b> New Plough <b>Inn</b> and Whispers Bar.|$|R
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} not a {{particularly}} prosperous time for <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> {{was involved in the}} case of R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn, a test {{of the role of the}} Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the Court of King's Bench by William Hart, a student at <b>the</b> <b>Inn,</b> who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> to call him to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students to the Bar, and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn, {{one of the few}} buildings on the high stretch of road. In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. In the early 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> now refers to the road that referred to itself.|$|E
5|$|By 1630, <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> {{was owned}} by William Riplingham, officer of the Great Wardrobe. Riplingham built an {{extension}} of the courtyard ranges {{on the site of the}} Angel Inn around 1638, for which he was fined due to breaking building regulations. These ranges survived up to the early 19th century. By 1677, the Angel {{was owned by}} James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton and occupied by Edward Fawcett, who ran <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> until his death in 1696. The premises accommodated livestock traders destined for Smithfield Market as well as long distance travellers.|$|E
50|$|The village once boasted several pubs, <b>The</b> Bowden <b>Inn,</b> <b>the</b> Shoulder of Mutton, <b>The</b> Helmington <b>Inn</b> and <b>the</b> Colliery <b>Inn.</b> <b>The</b> latter has {{recently}} been renamed the Copper Mine.|$|R

5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. <b>The</b> <b>Inn</b> remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn {{does not}} claim a {{specific}} foundation date; {{there is a}} tradition {{that none of the}} Inns of Court claims to be any older than the others. Law clerks and their apprentices have been established on the present site since at least 1370, with records dating from 1381. During the 15th and 16th centuries, <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> grew steadily with great prestige, reaching its pinnacle during the reign of Elizabeth I. <b>The</b> <b>Inn</b> was home to many important barristers and politicians, most notably Francis Bacon, and counted Elizabeth herself as a patron. Thanks to the efforts of prominent members such as William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, Gray's Inn became the largest of the four by number, with over 200 barristers recorded as members. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> became noted for the masques and revels that it threw, and William Shakespeare is believed to have first performed the Comedy of Errors play there.|$|E
5|$|In 1456 Reginald de Gray, {{the owner}} of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group {{including}} Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a feoffee or an owner representing the governing body of <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> partially back to the Gray family.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} public houses in Barrhead. These include Cross Stobs, The Kelburn, <b>The</b> Arthurlie <b>Inns,</b> <b>The</b> Fereneze <b>Inn,</b> and <b>The</b> Brig <b>Inn.</b> <b>The</b> Cross Stobs {{dates back to}} at least 1695.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 April 1947, the {{regiment}} was again reformed, as the Armoured Car Regiment of the 56th (London) Armoured Division, T.A., later {{to become the}} Reconnaissance Regiment of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division. In 1956, the Northamptonshire Yeomanry was reduced to one squadron and amalgamated with <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court Regiment as [...] "The Northamptonshire Yeomanry [...] "D" [...] Squadron, <b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court Regiment". This was reversed when, in 1961, <b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court Regiment amalgamated with the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) to form <b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court & City Yeomanry.|$|R
50|$|In its {{coaching}} heyday it {{had three}} coaching <b>inns,</b> <b>the</b> Tunbridge Wells <b>Inn,</b> <b>the</b> Victoria <b>Inn</b> and <b>the</b> York <b>Inn.</b> Each inn {{was associated with}} a different coaching company. The Tunbridge Wells serviced J. E. Cox Coaches, <b>the</b> Victoria <b>Inn</b> serviced Samuel Page Coaches and <b>the</b> York <b>Inn</b> serviced Alfred Burbury Coaches. Tunbridge Post Office opened on 17 March 1856.|$|R
5|$|In 1506 <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> {{was sold}} by the Gray family to Hugh Denys {{and a group of}} his feoffees {{including}} Roger Lupton. This was not a purchase on behalf of the society and after a five-year delay, it was transferred under the will of Denys in 1516 to the Carthusian House of Jesus of Bethlehem (Sheen Priory), which remained the Society's landlord until 1539, when the Second Act of Dissolution led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and passed ownership of <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 {{the island}} was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who {{established}} an inn for sailors. <b>The</b> <b>inn</b> was run by the Harris family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that {{the island was}} outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> was run by Mr W.L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to <b>the</b> <b>inn.</b> In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{marked the}} end of legal {{education}} at the Inns, and the class of Readers went into decline. The last Readers were appointed in 1677, and the position of the Readers as heads of <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> and members of Pension was taken by the Benchers.|$|E
50|$|The Council was {{established}} in 1852 by <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court and originally consisted of eight members led by Richard Bethell, with two members coming from each <b>Inn.</b> <b>The</b> Council supervised the education of students at <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court, and initially established five professorships. Professors would lecture students at <b>the</b> <b>Inns,</b> who were required to attend {{a certain number of}} lectures to be called to the Bar. In 1872 membership of the Council was expanded to twenty and mandatory examinations for the call to the Bar were introduced. The creation of the Senate of <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court and the Bar in 1967 pushed the Council into being a subdivision of that Senate rather than an independent organisation, and representatives of the Bar Council were added to the CLE. In 1997 the Council ceased to exist, transferring its assets to <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court School of Law, its educational and training functions to <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court and Bar Educational Trust and its regulatory functions to the General Council of the Bar.|$|R
50|$|At low tide, two vosses appear. The Newton Voss {{crosses the}} Newton Creek between Riverside Road West below <b>the</b> Dolphin <b>Inn</b> to near <b>the</b> Swan <b>Inn.</b> <b>The</b> Noss Voss crosses the brook between <b>the</b> Swan <b>Inn</b> and <b>the</b> Ship <b>Inn</b> in Noss Mayo.|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulty}} in capturing {{the complexity and}} subtleties of the many methods by which antibody drugs can be produced {{is one of the}} reasons that <b>the</b> <b>INN</b> dropped the source substem.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lawyers to}} occupy the {{premises}} which later became the Middle Temple came from St George's Inn, arriving by 1346. <b>The</b> <b>inn</b> was later deserted in favour of New Inn.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Angel, Islington, {{sits at the}} {{far east}} end of Pentonville Road, at its junction with Islington High Street. It was named after the Angel of the Annunciation that appeared on its sign. <b>The</b> <b>inn</b> pre-dated the construction of Pentonville Road, and {{had become one of}} the largest coaching inns in the local area by the 18th century. The site was cut in two by the construction of the road, with <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> remaining on the north side. A new building was constructed in 1899, later becoming a Lyons Corner House. It closed in 1959, and was threatened with demolition as a plan to improve junction improvements around Pentonville Road, but survived and is now partly occupied by a branch of The Co-operative Bank.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery {{sprung up}} around <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court, and took their name and {{original}} purpose from the chancery clerks, {{who used the}} buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs. As with <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court <b>the</b> precise dates of founding of <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery are unknown, but the one commonly {{said to be the}} oldest is Clifford's Inn, which existed from at least 1344. Thavie's Inn, founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} pubs in Caergwrle, {{including}} <b>The</b> Crown <b>Inn,</b> <b>The</b> Halfway <b>Inn,</b> <b>The</b> Bridge <b>Inn</b> (which {{is also a}} Chinese restaurant) and Ye Old Castle Inn. Many of these pubs have their own Pool and Darts teams.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery {{appear to}} have evolved in tandem with <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court. During the 12th and 13th centuries the Law was taught in the City of London {{primarily}} by the clergy.|$|R
5|$|The period saw the {{establishment}} of a regular system of legal education. In the early days of <b>the</b> <b>Inn,</b> the quality of legal education had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call to the Bar were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from <b>the</b> <b>Inn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{shooting for}} the episode {{was done at}} The Paint Hall studio. The scenes at <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> at the Crossroads were filmed on location at the Redhall Estate, in Ballycarry, during {{the first days of}} September2010.|$|E
5|$|At about 23:00 on August 26, {{the first}} {{shots were fired}} in the Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American pickets from Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania {{regiment}} fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near <b>the</b> <b>inn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its initial}} links with Gray's <b>Inn,</b> <b>the</b> {{regiment}} claimed descent from <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court Volunteers of 1780. The Rangers were actually founded to accommodate members of <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court {{who did not}} wish to join <b>the</b> exclusive 23rd (<b>Inns</b> of Court) Middlesex RVC, which had a better claim to descent from The Devil's Own.|$|R
5|$|With {{increased}} {{numbers of}} people visiting Norwich, trade boomed in <b>the</b> <b>inns</b> around <b>the</b> marketplace. In addition to the existing taverns, at least four very large coaching inns opened along Gentleman's Walk. By {{the latter half of}} the 18thcentury stagecoaches were leaving one or other of <b>the</b> <b>inns</b> almost daily to London, and <b>the</b> <b>inns</b> also served as the hub of a network of frequent services throughout East Anglia.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery {{was used as}} {{accommodation}} and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> changed. After <b>the</b> outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> ceased, and as a result <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. <b>The</b> last <b>Inn</b> to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.|$|R
