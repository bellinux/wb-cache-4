50|$|Thermal grease (also called CPU grease, heat paste, {{heat sink}} compound, heat sink paste, thermal compound, thermal gel, <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material,</b> or thermal paste) {{is a kind}} of {{thermally}} conductive (but usually electrically insulating) compound, which is commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat sources (e.g., high-power semiconductor devices). The main role of thermal grease is to eliminate air gaps or spaces (which act as thermal insulator) from the interface area so as to maximize heat transfer.

40|$|In power microelectronics, {{the trends}} towards {{miniaturization}} and higher performances result in higher power densities and more heat to be dissipated. In most electronic assembly, <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> (TIM) help provide {{a path for}} heat dissipation but still represent a bottleneck in the total thermal resistance of the system. VA-CNTs mats are typically grown on HR silicon substrate with Al 2 O 3 diffusion barrier layer using Thermal CVD process.

40|$|Heat {{conduction}} {{plays an}} important role in the efficiency and life span of electronic components. To keep electronic components running efficiently and at a proper temperature, thermal management systems transfer heat generated from the components to thermal surfaces such as heat sinks, heat pipes, radiators, or heat spreaders. Thermal surfaces absorb the heat from the electrical components and dissipate it into the environment, preventing overheating. To ensure the best contact between electrical components and <b>thermal</b> surfaces, <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> are applied. In addition to having high conductivity, ideal <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> should be compliant to conform to the components, increasing the surface contact. While many different types of <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> exist for varying purposes, Energy Science Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI), of San Diego, California, proposed using carbon velvets as <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> for general aerospace and electronics applications. NASA s Johnson Space Center granted ESLI a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to develop <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> that are lightweight and compliant, and demonstrate high thermal conductance even for nonflat surfaces. Through Phase II SBIR work, ESLI created Vel-Therm for the commercial market. Vel-Therm is a soft, carbon fiber velvet consisting of numerous high thermal conductivity carbon fibers anchored in a thin layer of adhesive. The velvets are fabricated by precision cutting continuous carbon fiber tows and electrostatically flocking the fibers into uncured adhesive, using proprietary techniques...|$|R
50|$|The CPUs codenamed Devil's Canyon, {{covering}} the i5 and i7 K-series SKUs, employ {{a new and}} improved <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> (TIM) called next-generation polymer <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> (NGPTIM). This improved TIM reduces the CPU's operating temperatures and improves the overclocking potential, as something that had been problematic since the introduction of Ivy Bridge. Other changes for the Devil's Canyon CPUs include a TDP increase to 88 W, additional decoupling capacitors to help smooth out the outputs from the fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR), {{and support for the}} VT-d that was previously limited to non-K-series SKUs. TSX was another feature brought over from the non-K-series SKUs, until August 2014 when a microcode update disabled TSX due to a bug that was discovered in its implementation.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> (shortened to T.I.M.) {{describes}} {{any material}} that is inserted between two parts {{in order to enhance}} the thermal coupling between these two components. A large portion of those application are related to the heat dissipation and the T.I.M. is inserted between the heat producing device (e.g. the heat source) and the heat dissipation device (e.g. the heat sink).|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> {{have been}} widely adopted in the thermal {{management}} for electronics system. Most of the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> are made of polymers with thermally conductive particles distributed inside to enhance the thermal conductivity.

In the present paper, a parameterized cubic cell model had been developed and implemented by the finite element method. The numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of the filler distributions on the effective thermal conductivity of the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials.</b> The volume percentage loadings of the particles ranging from 13 % to 74 % had been considered, and different particle distribution patterns had also been analyzed. The simulation results were compared with the experimental data as well as other models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} new {{characterization}} equipment for <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> is presented. <b>Thermal</b> management of electronic products {{relies on the}} effective dissipation of heat.

For the determination of this data an experimental set-up for a static measurement is presented, which evaluate thermal conductivity of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> (e. g. adhesive, solder, pads, or pastes).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{trend of}} further scaling down electronic components put an increasing {{demand for more}} efficient cooling. A {{significant part of the}} thermal resistance from source to ambient occurs at the <b>interface</b> between <b>materials,</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> are crucial for efficient heat transfer. Recent years have seen a significant amount of progress various types of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials.</b> In this review, the field of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> (TIMs) development is summarized and analyzed, focusing on three topics which have received attention at a research level, and their road towards market applicability. The first topic is development in particle laden polymers, which uses thermally conductive filler particles in a polymer matrix. New development is focused on novel fillers such as h-BN or carbon based fillers, and hybrid filler combinations. The next topic is continuous metal phase TIMs, which includes solder and liquid metal TIMs. The thermal performance is already very good, and development is largely focused on improving the mechanical properties. Finally, the last topic is carbon nanotube array TIMs, which used chemical vapor deposition-grown carbon nanotube arrays as bridging material. The concept has promise for great performance in both handling, mechanical stability and thermal performance, but is still at a research stage. In addition to these topics, a quantitative study on the progress of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> development is made, both in terms of research papers published and in terms of patents filed. The study shows a stable trend of continuous development on all levels and concludes that significant improvements can be expected to continue in the future...|$|R
5000|$|Additive Process - Thick {{film is a}} {{selective}} additive deposition process which uses material only where it is needed.

50|$|When indium is {{compressed}} its bulk {{thermal conductivity}} of 86 W/mK pushes down the resistance at the interface {{to be much}} lower than greases, fluids, or adhesives.

50|$|Often called <b>Thermal</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Material</b> (TIM) (e.g. Intel)Perfectly flat {{surfaces}} in contact give optimal cooling, but perfect flatness and absence of microscopic air gaps is not practically possible, particularly in mass-produced equipment. A very thin skim of thermal compound, {{which is much}} more thermally conductive than air, though much less so than metal, can improve thermal contact and cooling by filling in the air gaps. If only a small amount of compound just sufficient to fill the gaps is used, best temperature reduction will be obtained.|$|E
5000|$|Ivy Bridge's {{temperatures}} are reportedly 10 °C higher compared to Sandy Bridge when a CPU is overclocked, even at default voltage setting. Impress PC Watch, a Japanese website, performed experiments that confirmed earlier speculations {{that this is}} because Intel used a poor quality (and perhaps lower cost) <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> (thermal paste, or [...] "TIM") between the chip and the heat spreader, instead of the fluxless solder of previous generations. The mobile Ivy Bridge processors are not affected by this issue {{because they do not}} use a heat spreader between the chip and cooling system.|$|E
50|$|Heat sinks {{are widely}} used in electronics, and have become almost {{essential}} to modern central processing units. In common use, it is a metal object brought into contact with an electronic component's hot surface—though in most cases, a thin <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> mediates between the two surfaces. Microprocessors and power handling semiconductors are examples of electronics that need a heat sink to reduce their temperature through increased thermal mass and heat dissipation (primarily by conduction and convection {{and to a lesser}} extent by radiation). Heat sinks have become almost essential to modern integrated circuits like microprocessors, DSPs, GPUs, and more.|$|E
25|$|For each {{interface}} between two objects {{in contact with}} each other, {{there will be a}} temperature drop across the interface.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{design of a}} heat sink is a metal device with many fins. The high thermal {{conductivity}} of the metal combined with its large surface area result in the rapid transfer of thermal energy to the surrounding, cooler, air. This cools the heat sink and whatever it is in direct thermal contact with. Use of fluids (for example coolants in refrigeration) and <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> (in cooling electronic devices) ensures good transfer of thermal energy to the heat sink. Similarly, a fan may improve the transfer of thermal energy from the heat sink to the air.|$|E
5000|$|Indium is {{an ideal}} <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> for heat {{dissipation}} in many of today's very hot integrated circuits. Of all the common materials, copper and aluminum have the highest thermal conductivity. But on the micro level most materials are very rough and a two piece sandwich of copper {{may not have a}} good conductive path between them. To overcome this limitation, indium is the ideal material due to its high bulk thermal conductivity (86W/mK) and its soft compressibility allowing it to fill voids in rough surfaces. In addition, as a seal indium will not pump out or dry out. In fact, indium has the unique ability to cold weld two dissimilar materials if the materials have a thin coating of [...]002”-.003” of indium they will ‘cold-weld’ together if the clamping pressure is more than 40 psi.|$|E
50|$|The current {{focus in}} R&D is on cost reduction, {{increase}} of power density, increase of reliability and reduction of parasitic lumped elements. These parasitics are unwanted capacitances between circuit parts and inductances of circuit traces. Both can have {{negative effects on}} the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) of the module if it is operated as an inverter, for instance. Another problem connected to parasitics is their {{negative impact on the}} switching behavior and the switching loss of the power semiconductors. Therefore, manufacturers work on minimizing the parasitic elements of their modules while keeping cost low and maintain a high degree of interchangeability of their modules with those of a second source (other manufacturer).A further aspect for optimization is the so-called thermal path between the heat source (the dies) and the heat-sink. The heat has to pass through different physical layers as solder, DCB, baseplate, <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> (TIM) and the bulk of the heat-sink, until it is transferred to a gaseous medium as air or a fluid medium as water or oil. Since modern silicon-carbide power semiconductors show a larger power density, the requirements for heat transfer are rising.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} across <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> is {{a critical}} issue for microelectronics thermal management. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), {{one of the most}} important components of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> presents a large barrier for heat flow due to its low thermal conductivity. In this paper, we use molecular dynamics simulations to identify the upper limit of the PDMS thermal conductivity by studying thermal transport in single PDMS chains with different lengths. We found that even individual molecular chains had low thermal conductivities (κ[*]∼[*] 7 W/mK), which is attributed to the chain segment disordering. Studies on double chain and crystalline structures reveal that the structure influences thermal transport due to inter-chain phonon scatterings and suppression of acoustic phonon modes. We also simulated amorphous bulk PDMS to identify the lower bound of PDMS thermal conductivity and found the low thermal conductivity (κ[*]∼[*] 0. 2 W/mK) is mainly due to the inefficient transport mechanism through extended vibration modes.
