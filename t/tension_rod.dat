25|$|Changing {{the pitch}} of a timpani by turning each <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> {{individually}} is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be considered machine timpani, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{components}} that make up a drum's anatomy. Some of these anatomical components vary dependent upon the type of drum, the manufacturer, and the year in which it was made. However, nearly all modern drums have the same essential components. Kick drums often have legs called [...] "spurs" [...] {{on either side of the}} drum shell. These spurs are used to prevent the kick drum from rolling side to side, to prevent the drum from sliding forward as it is being played and to provide overall added stability to the drum. Casings, also known as lugs, vary in shape and size. They all serve the same purpose as the receiving end of the drum <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> (also known as a tuning screw) and provide the anchor point for the tension rods themselves. Casings are found on nearly all modern drums. The number of casings a drum has can vary from drum to drum and manufacturer to manufacturer. A drum can have as little as six casings and as many as twelve. Tension rods, also known as tuning screws, are threaded bolts that are placed around the rim of a drum and screw into the casings. They enable the musician tp adjust the tension of the drum's head and effect it's overall pitch, tone, and timbre. They come in many lengths and should also always have a <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> washer that is often made of metal or hard plastic.|$|E

50|$|Single-tension is one {{of several}} ways to apply the {{necessary}} tension to drum heads. Single-tension systems largely replaced the ancient rope-tension methods in the late 19th Century and are still used today in lower-priced drums for student use.In this system, one long <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> with a threaded end extends through the hoop holding the top drum head and then down outside the drum shell to a threaded hole in the bottom hoop. There usually is a small guide halfway down on single-tension drum shells to keep the tension rods straight.In older drums, the hoops are often held tight by separate clamps through which the threaded <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> fits.Tension is applied by turning a special key that fits into a hexagonal drive, but many bass drums (especially those models designed for concert use) have permanent wing-nuts permanently affixed to each <b>tension</b> <b>rod,</b> even on double-tension drums.|$|E
5000|$|Ayotte is {{especially}} {{well known for}} their resurrection and improvement of wooden drum hoops, developed as an aesthetic & acoustically pleasing alternative option in place of diecast zinc or flanged steel hoops, although Ayotte also still offers steel hoops. The company's tension mounts (a.k.a. [...] "lugs") assembly is also unique unusual. Using a cut-away lug housing, the traditional <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> intersects perpendicular to a cylindrical nut (similar to rack-and-pinion) with a nylon plug insert, which once tightened with an Allen wrench makes movement of the <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> virtually impossible, thus ensuring the drum will stay in tune longer. Ayotte's TuneLock tension system is guaranteed to be indestructible under normal use.|$|E

2500|$|A drum [...] "hoop" [...] or [...] "rim" [...] {{may be made}} of metal, wood, {{or other}} {{materials}} and is used to hold a drumhead against a drum shell, either with bolts through metal [...] "claws" [...] attached directly to a hoop, or bolts through holes in a flanged or die-cast rim. The bolts, called <b>tension</b> <b>rods,</b> are screwed into threaded [...] "lugs" [...] attached to the drum shell, in order to tighten and tune the drumhead.

5000|$|The CAT II Q {{was one of}} {{the first}} [...] "non tape" [...] {{bi-directional}} restoration devices. It consists of a shaft (<b>tension</b> <b>rod)</b> with a pusher plate and a bell with a silicone gripper, the bell can move on the shaft and has a collet to hold it in place. The collet easily slides up the <b>tension</b> <b>rod,</b> staying where it is placed, until being manually re-positioned for more or less tension. The skin is placed over the bell and silicone gripper is applied to hold it in place, the bell is moved to desired position to provide the tension and then the collet is fixed to hold the bell at that position.|$|E

2500|$|The basic timpani {{consists}} of a drumhead stretched across {{the opening of a}} bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass and sometimes aluminum. In the Sachs–Hornbostel classification, the timpani are thus considered membranophones. The head is affixed to a [...] (also called a fleshhoop), which in turn is held onto the bowl by a counterhoop, which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called <b>tension</b> <b>rods</b> placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight <b>tension</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R

50|$|One or two cast or pressed metal rims attach by {{threaded}} tension rods or lugs to nut boxes bolted {{onto the}} shell {{and hold the}} heads onto the bearing edges of the shell. The <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> assembly needs to be precision-machined, cast and fitted to enable predictable and secure tuning without inhibiting resonance or introducing extra vibration. All components will be placed under great tension and experience added stresses from playing.|$|E
50|$|When {{tensioning}} a head, the tensioning rod {{closest to}} the tensioner should be tightened first. The {{reason for this is}} to keep an even tension across the drum head, which is impossible to do if the lugs are tightened differently. Next, the <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> opposite the first lug is tightened by the same number of turns. The process is repeated for the remaining lugs in order, moving {{from one side of the}} head to the other.|$|E

50|$|Flat {{plates are}} usually {{constructed}} as circular thin flat membrane surfaces {{to be used}} in dead-end geometry modules. Spiral wounds are constructed from similar flat membranes but {{in the form of a}} “pocket” containing two membrane sheets separated by a highly porous support plate. Several such pockets are then wound around a tube to create a tangential flow geometry and to reduce membrane fouling. hollow fiber modules consist of an assembly of self-supporting fibers with dense skin separation layers, and a more open matrix helping to withstand pressure gradients and maintain structural integrity. The hollow fiber modules can contain up to 10,000 fibers ranging from 200 to 2500 μm in diameter; The main advantage of hollow fiber modules is very large surface area within an enclosed volume, increasing the efficiency of the separation process.Disc tube module is using a cross-flow geometry, and consists of a pressure tube and hydraulic discs, which are held by a central <b>tension</b> <b>rod,</b> and membrane cushions that lie between two discs.|$|E
50|$|The longer span, (136 ft) {{uses the}} same {{materials}} but is more intricate. It has nine panels, each 15 ft wide, creating chords which arch both {{above and below the}} deck {{to the point that they}} are 22 ft apart at their most distant from each other, in mid-span. The upper chord is made of flanged plate girders riveted together with top and bottom iron cap plates bolted on; the lower of double 1+1/4 by 3 in wrought iron bars. Both are joined at the span's end with end pins. A lattice-braced system similar to that on the short span supports the lenticular truss, with similar members serving as horizontal braces below the deck. Iron tie rods 1+1/4 in wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> at each end of the truss. A set of expansion rollers at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of post {{consists}} of a wooden post, roughly 60-90 cm (24-36 inches) tall, covered in rough fabric or sisal. The post is mounted vertically in a wide base, which allows the cat to stretch upward on its rear legs and scratch freely without tipping it over. A post that is unstable or does not allow a cat to fully extend its body might put off the cat from using it. Surfaces vary: the post may be covered in sisal rope, upholstery fabric, or the jute backing of a piece of carpet. Many pet owners say they have to experiment with different surfaces to find one that their cats will scratch reliably. Experts say that cats generally prefer sisal or corrugated cardboard surfaces.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FRO/is_/ai_65539058 Other kinds of scratching posts are more elaborate, with several levels of horizontal platforms for climbing and cozy cave-like areas where cats may hide. Very tall ones are often called [...] "cat trees." [...] These may have a vertical <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> that extends to the ceiling to provide extra stability.|$|E

25|$|The second biggest {{factor that}} affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and {{tightened}} down with <b>tension</b> <b>rods,</b> the <b>tension</b> {{of the head}} can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the amplitude of the sound is reduced and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.|$|R
50|$|The snare drum is {{constructed}} of two heads—both usually made of plastic—along with a rattle of metal wires {{on the bottom}} head called the snares. The wires can also {{be placed on the}} top, as in the tarol snare, or both heads {{as in the case of}} the Highland snare drum. The top head is typically called the batter head because that is where the drummer strikes it, while the bottom head is called the snare head because that is where the snares are located. The tension of each head is held constant by tension rods. <b>Tension</b> <b>rod</b> adjustment allows the pitch and tonal character of the drum to be customized by the player. The strainer is a lever that engages or disengages contact between the snares and the head, and allows snare tension adjustment. If the strainer is disengaged, the sound of the drum resembles a tom because the snares are inactive. The rim is the metal ring around the batter head, which can be used for a variety of things, although it is notably used to sound a piercing rimshot with the drumstick.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1978 {{while working}} for the company Musicaid in St. Albans, Dave Simmons {{developed}} a device with similar capabilities to the Syndrum and Synare, which he called the SDS-3. The SDS-3 featured four drum channels and a noise generator; the SDS-4 was a functionally similar two-channel version. [...] At this juncture, the drum pads were round, with wooden frames and real 8-inch drum heads. Musicaid was also the distributor for the Lyricon wind synthesizer as played by John L. Walters of Landscape. Walters introduced Richard James Burgess to Simmons and Burgess began using the SDS-3s and SDS-4s live, on stage, with his band Landscape. Recognizing {{the potential for a}} fully electronic drum set that could replace the traditional acoustic set rather than supplement it, Burgess began collaborating with Dave Simmons. They mocked up the sounds and flowchart using an ARP 2600 synthesizer. Since Burgess was using the instrument in a live setting, they developed the four customizable preset buttons. The distinctive hexagonal shape came about after triangles and bat-wing mock-ups had been tried. Burgess finally decided that a honeycomb shape would fit together ergonomically and be simple yet distinctive in appearance. A limited edition of what Simmons referred to as the Mount Rushmore Head sets were also built. Burgess has two of these sets. The basic descending tom-tom sound was modeled after the way Burgess tuned his Pearl single-headed concert tom kit on which he would loosen one <b>tension</b> <b>rod,</b> causing a wrinkle in the head and creating a descending pitch after the tom was hit.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{stability}} {{is essential for}} successful bone ingrowth into non-cemented prostheses. An entire new concept to increase the initial stability directly after implantation of intramedullary stems was developed (the <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> prosthesis). The concept {{is based on a}} <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> made out of memory metal that pulls a proximal stem of a prosthesis towards a distal anchor with a constant force. The stress generated along the long axis of the bone produces a radial stress around the prosthesis in the proximal femur. The main goal of this design is to increase the primary stability of the prosthesis during the ingrowth phase and to prevent stress shielding and bone resorption, as realized by the radial force applied to the proximal endosteum of the bone. To assess the efficacy of this concept and to collect data for the anchor design, an implant was developed for implantation into the tibia of the goat. Analyses of push-out strength and bone reactions were performed postoperatively. After 48 weeks the push-out strength of this implant was increased and the histological evaluation showed almost complete osseousintegration. Histomorphometrical analysis showed pronounced, permanent periosteal reactions, located around the anchor of the implant, which generates the radial stress. These first results showed that the bone can withstand the radial stress provoked by the anchor of the <b>tension</b> <b>rod.</b> It is concluded that the concept of a <b>tension</b> <b>rod</b> prosthesis is viable...|$|E
