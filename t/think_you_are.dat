His daughter Hannah married Samuel Gluckstein (1821-1873), who was in business with Barnett Salmon of Salmon & Gluckstein. They had several children, including Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Salmon founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887, and Helena, who married him. One {{of the children of}} Helena and Barnett Salmon was Alfred Salmon (1868-1928), the great-grandfather of Nigella Lawson.|$|E
