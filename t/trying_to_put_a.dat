500|$|The {{music for}} Silver Star Story Complete {{consists}} of entirely new background themes by Noriyuki Iwadare. While Hiroshi Fujioka, Isao Mizoguchi, and Yoshiaki Kubodera collaborated with Iwadare on the Sega CD version, only Iwadare would {{return for the}} remake, composing nearly one hundred new songs. When creating the music for Silver Star Story Complete, Iwadare drew from his own experiences, admitting that he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> personal touch on his work and [...] "express [...] through [...] honest emotions". Music director Isao Mizoguchi claims that the music process was [...] "a little different" [...] than the companies' previous works, with the game's main themes being composed before they viewed the scenes that required them, making adjustments as they went along. [...] Each song was divided into four categories: town or village, dungeon, battle, or field; each with their own pacing and emotional direction. [...] Iwadare described the game's music as [...] "very well received" [...] according to fan feedback. The Japanese version features a new opening theme, [...] "Tsu·Ba·Sa" [...] (TSU・BA・SA, lit. Wings) performed by Kyōko Hikami. [...] An intermediary song, , also called [...] "The Boat Song", {{was added to the}} game to heighten the emotion of Alex and Luna's departure into the world, which was kept at Mizoguchi's insistence even as material was being cut for time.|$|E

The last verse of the song best reflects my feelings on this. This song has been recorded by many artists and remains one of my favourites. Very emotional." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the closing}} {{arguments}} of Libby's trial, defense lawyer Ted Wells {{told the jury}} [...] "The government in its questioning really tried to put a cloud over Vice President Cheney...And the clear suggestion by the questions were, well, maybe {{there was some kind}} of skullduggery, some kind of scheme between Libby and the vice president going on in private, but that's unfair." [...] Patrick Fitzgerald responded to this assertion by telling the jury, [...] "You know what? [...] said something here that we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> cloud on the vice president. We'll talk straight. There is a cloud over the vice president. He sent Libby off to [...] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant talked about the wife [...] We didn't put that cloud there.

2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough.

2500|$|In the U.S., [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] {{was issued}} as the album's first single, with an {{accompanying}} music video. Initially, the album and single lingered {{for almost a}} year without performing well, but when Geffen founder David Geffen was asked to lend support to the band, he obliged, personally convincing MTV executives to play [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] during the network's after-hours rotation. Even though the video was initially only played once at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, heavy metal and hard rock fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse. The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles. The music video took place in New York. According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they were coming out of a bus into New York. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them, [...] "You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby; you're gonna die!" [...] The song was featured in the 1988 Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool, starring Clint Eastwood, and members of the band had a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
