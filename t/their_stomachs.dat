5|$|The {{introduction}} of plastic waste {{to the ocean}} environment by humans is new. Sperm whales have occasionally been found with pieces of plastic in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{they feed}} almost {{exclusively}} on euphausiids (mainly the genera Euphausia and Thysanoessa), as well as taking small amounts of amphipods (e.g. Themisto gaudichaudii) and various species of fish. Of the more than 16,000 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Hemisphere between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs,</b> 99.4% fed on euphausiids, 0.5% on fish, and 0.1% on amphipods. In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume E. superba.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. <b>Their</b> <b>stomachs</b> also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
40|$|Decapitated Vs. Stomach buried – A {{study of}} decapitated people and stomach placed people in Iron Age in Sweden and Denmark. This essay is about decapitated persons in graves and those buried on <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> in the Iron Age in Sweden and Denmark. The {{analysis}} {{is to compare}} these graves by six perspectives; location of the grave, construction of the grave, grave goods, sex, age and interpretations of the grave. Out of this I found out {{if there are any}} different patterns of these graves, except that they are decapitated and places on <b>their</b> <b>stomach.</b> I compare between fifteen graves located on <b>their</b> <b>stomach,</b> nine decapitated graves, four graves that involve both and eight graves that do not contain any of it...|$|R
50|$|During pregnancy, {{many women}} {{experience}} {{a separation of}} <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> muscles, known as diastasis recti. It affects the rectus abdominis muscle.|$|R

5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Rules for the Olympic {{skeleton}} competitions {{were set}} by the FIBT and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). They entrusted four to seven officials with making decisions regarding competition rules: one or two technical delegates, a jury president, two jury members, and two optional jury assistants. These decisions were implemented and enforced by a race director, to whom the overall responsibility for running the competition was given. Under the rules, competitors were guaranteed a minimum of six official training runs in the days prior to the competition. The competition itself consisted of four heats, with the starting order of athletes determined by their FIBT rankings {{prior to the start}} of the Games. Athletes began their runs on their sleds at a starting block, ran briefly while holding their sleds, and then laid on <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> on the sleds through the remainder of the course. Athletes were ranked by the speed of their times between their start and when they crossed the finish line at the bottom of the track.|$|E
50|$|Camels {{can further}} {{conserve}} water by closing an orifice in <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> to create two compartments: one {{for water and}} one for food.|$|R
50|$|In {{winter and}} early spring, the Silvery Mountain Vole feeds mainly on roots {{of plants and}} on seeds, these food {{materials}} form 87-92% of <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> composition from November to February. In March, they begin to feed on green plant vegetation, and these fresh greens form 90-99% of <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> composition from April to September. In autumn, these animals forage for a stock of food for winter. The mass of these food reserves are not large, and range from 2-5g to 35-42g.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler applies a front facelock to the {{opponent}} and then throws their legs out behind them, falling onto <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> and driving {{the opponent}}'s {{face into the}} mat. It {{is similar to a}} standard DDT, except it targets the face of the victim rather than the head, and the wrestler falls onto <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> instead of falling back as they would in a DDT. Seth Rollins briefly used a single underhook version of this move as a finisher in early 2015.|$|R
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} infections caused by {{parasitic}} worms {{in a number}} of individuals of both sexes found the presence of larvae from a species from the Contracaecum genus in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> and intestines, Anisakis simplex in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs,</b> Pharurus pallasii in their ear canals, Hadwenius seymouri in their intestines, and Leucasiella arctica in their rectums.|$|E
25|$|Captured whales {{often have}} indigestible squid beaks in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs.</b> The mouth {{contains}} the radula (the rough tongue {{common to all}} molluscs except bivalvia).|$|E
50|$|The genus name Fulmarus {{is derived}} from the Old Norse word fúll meaning foul, and már meaning gull, in {{reference}} to the smell of <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> oil.|$|R
50|$|Mummichogs are omnivorous. Analyses of <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> {{contents}} {{have found}} diatoms, amphipods and other crustaceans, molluscs, fish eggs (including their own species), very small fish, insect larvae, {{and bits of}} eelgrass.|$|R
50|$|This armlock is {{executed}} with Uke on <b>their</b> <b>stomach,</b> while tori has uke's arm trapped {{with the}} elbow beneath tori's armpit. Tori lifts uke's hand, causing hyperextension of the elbow joint {{in a similar}} manner to Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame.|$|R
25|$|Some prisoners had <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> surgically {{removed and}} the {{oesophagus}} reattached to the intestines. Parts of the brain, lungs, liver, etc., {{were removed from}} some prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Many sharks {{have the}} ability to turn <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of {{unwanted}} contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).|$|E
25|$|Kathy had vivid {{nightmares about}} the murders and {{discovered}} {{the order in}} which they occurred and the rooms where they took place. The Lutz children also began sleeping on <b>their</b> <b>stomachs,</b> {{in the same way that}} the dead bodies in the DeFeo murders had been found.|$|E

5000|$|Turnovers: used to {{maneuver}} an opponent {{who is on}} all fours or flat on <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> to <b>their</b> back, in order to score points, prepare for a pin or {{in order to gain}} a more dominant position.|$|R
50|$|Hereditary diffuse {{gastric cancer}} is an {{inherited}} genetic syndrome {{caused by a}} change in the E-cadherin gene. It often results in stomach cancer such that it is recommended that those who carry the gene have <b>their</b> <b>stomach</b> removed.|$|R
25|$|In his own confession, Gilles {{testified that}} “when the said {{children}} were dead, he kissed them {{and those who}} had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed”.|$|E
25|$|Like all titanosaurs, the saltasaurids possessed small, peg-like {{teeth that}} were not usable for chewing. Coproliths from an {{unidentified}} titanosaur found in India suggest a diet of conifers, cycads, and early species of grasses. Unable to chew and probably lacking gastroliths, sauropods survived by retaining plant matter in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> {{for long periods of}} time, fermenting it to extract as many resources as possible. Their long necks allowed them to graze over a large area while standing, reducing energy use.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids produce {{digestive}} juices in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs,</b> and {{use their}} pedipalps and chelicerae to pour them over their dead prey. The digestive juices rapidly turn the prey into a broth of nutrients, which the arachnid sucks into a pre-buccal cavity located immediately {{in front of the}} mouth. Behind the mouth is a muscular, sclerotised pharynx, which acts as a pump, sucking the food through the mouth and on into the oesophagus and stomach. In some arachnids, the oesophagus also acts as an additional pump.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have been found to}} be effective in preventing SIDS including changing the sleeping position, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> or side while sleeping.|$|E
25|$|Sharks {{are known}} to be {{opportunistic}} feeders, and the bull shark is no exception to this, as {{it is part of the}} Carcharhinus family of sharks. Normally, sharks eat in short bursts, and when food is scarce, sharks digest for a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation. As part of their survival mechanism, bull sharks will regurgitate the food in <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> in order to escape from a predator. This is a distraction tactic; if the predator moves to eat the regurgitated food the bull shark can use the opportunity to escape.|$|E
25|$|Finally Stephen {{faced the}} Ottomans in battle. The Moldavians luring the main Ottoman forces into a forest {{that was set}} on fire, causing some casualties. According to another battle description, the {{defending}} Moldavian forces repelled several Ottoman attacks with steady fire from hand-guns. The attacking Turkish Janissaries were forced to crouch on <b>their</b> <b>stomachs</b> instead of charging headlong into the defenders positions. Seeing the imminent defeat of his forces, Mehmed charged with his personal guard against the Moldavians, managing to rally the Janissaries, and turning the tide of the battle. Turkish Janissaries penetrated inside the forest and engaged the defenders in man-to-man fighting.|$|E
