5|$|Under German occupation, <b>the</b> <b>professions</b> of Polish {{journalists and}} writers were {{virtually}} eliminated, {{as they had}} little opportunity to publish their work. The Underground State's Department of Culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals, enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication.

Literary discussions were held, and prominent writers of the period working in Poland included, among others, Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, Leslaw Bartelski, Tadeusz Borowski, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Maria Dąbrowska, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, future Nobel Prize winner Czesław Miłosz, Zofia Nałkowska, Jan Parandowski, Leopold Staff, Kazimierz Wyka, and Jerzy Zawieyski. Writers wrote about the difficult conditions in the prisoner-of-war camps (Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński, Stefan Flukowski, Leon Kruczkowski, Andrzej Nowicki and Marian Piechała), the ghettos, and even from inside the concentration camps (Jan Maria Gisges, Halina Gołczowa, Zofia Górska (Romanowiczowa), Tadeusz Hołuj, Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski and Marian Kubicki).

40|$|Objectives The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to examine (1) the association between flexible employment and nurses' intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession,</b> and (2) whether or not support at work mediates the association between flexible employment and nurses' intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Flexible employment is analyzed objectively using non-permanent contract, part-time employment status, casual employment status, involuntary hours and on-call work, and subjectively using job insecurity. Support at work refers to organizational, supervisor and peer support. Methods Data come from our survey of 1396 nurses employed in three teaching hospitals in Southern Ontario. Descriptive statistics are provided. Bivariate correlations, hierarchical regression analysis and mediation tests are conducted. Results Compared to those in full-time employment, nurses in part-time employment {{do not intend to}} leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> None of <b>the</b> other objective flexible employment factors are associated with intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Perceived job insecurity is associated with intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Low support at work contributes to intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> and mediates <b>the</b> association between job insecurity and intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Conclusions <b>The</b> study provides evidence to health sector managers and policy makers that part-time employment, perceived job security and support at work are important factors to consider in efforts to retain nurses in <b>the</b> <b>profession.</b> Nurses Flexible employment Job insecurity Intention to leave <b>the</b> <b>profession...</b>|$|R
