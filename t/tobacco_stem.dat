40|$|Several cDNA clones {{encoding}} 4 -coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4 CL) {{were isolated}} from a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cDNA library and grouped into two classes. Sequencing of one cDNA from each class {{showed that the}} clones were similar to other 4 CL genes and about 80 % identical with each other. Genomic Southern blots using DNA from Nicotiana sylvestris, Nicotiana tomentosiformis, and N. tabacum demonstrated the presence of both classes of 4 CL sequences (4 CL 1 and 4 CL 2) in the progenitor species and in tobacco. Northern blots indicated that 4 CL mRNA transcripts are highest in old stems and higher in the unpigmented corolla tubes than in the pigmented limbs of tobacco flowers. The 4 CL genes are developmentally regulated and are wound and methyl jasmonate inducible. The relative abilities of recombinant 4 CL 1 and 4 CL 2 proteins to utilize 4 -coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate as substrates were similar and comparable with that of 4 CL in <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> extracts. Surprisingly, both recombinant 4 CL proteins utilized cinnamate as a substrate, an activity not observed in stem extracts.

40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) {{belongs to}} the group of plants that produce {{agricultural}} raw material. Besides leaves, which are used to satisfy the passion for smoking, tobacco can be used for producing oil and biodiesel, because it contains 30 - 40 % of vegetable oil. Because of its content of citric acid, tobacco can be used for production of dyes and varnishes. Seed cake contains high percentage of proteins (35 - 44 %) and can be used as livestock feed. Because of the high contents of lignin (40 - 45 %) and cellulose (28 - 40 %), <b>tobacco</b> <b>stems</b> can be used for production of energy briquettes, which makes tobacco obtain a new usability value. The aim of the experimental researches presented in this paper is to define the possibilities for production of briquettes from <b>tobacco</b> <b>stems</b> and wood raw material and to evaluate the impact of this kind of raw material on briquettes properties. For this purpose five models were made: O-control model: 100 % wood raw material (BW); model T-I - 25 % <b>tobacco</b> <b>stems</b> (TS) : 75 % BW; model T-II - 50 % TS : 50 % BW; model T-III - 75 % TS : 25 % BW and model T-IV - 100 % TS. The results of the research show that density of the briquettes is within the limits of 526. 61 kg/m 3 for model T-IV, to 782. 73 kg/m 3 for control model-O. The ash content is a little lower than the standard values and it ranges from 0. 32 % for O-control model, to 2. 17 % for model T-IV.

Growth {{activity}} with and without kinetin was measured by effects on fresh and dry weights of 30 -day cultures of fresh tobacco pith. Transport inhibition was measured by following uptake and output of IAA- 2 - 14 C through 10 mm bean epicotyl sections. The distribution of callus growth on vascularized <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> segments was also observed. Avena first internode extension assays established the relative activities: dicamba > amiben > dinoben suggested by pith growth results. Growth effects of active compounds were similar with and without kinetin, except that amiben was less active with kinetin, while 2, 3, 6 -trichlorobenzoic acid was more active with kinetin than alone. The weak auxin activity of NPA was confirmed. Transport experiments showed that NPA was the most inhibitory compound tested, followed by TIBA. Other compounds tested were at least 300 times less inhibitory to IAA transport. The best growth promoters were the least inhibitory to transport, and the most effective transport inhibitors were at best poor auxins. It is suggested that the weak auxin and auxin synergistic activity of TIBA (and perhaps 2, 3 -dichlorobenzoic acid) in extension growth tests arises from its inhibition of transport of endogenous or added auxin out of the sections, rather than from its intrinsic auxin activity. Chemically induced apolar callus growth on vascularized <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> explants can arise from inhibition of native auxin transport, apolar growth stimulation by auxinic action of the test compound, or both...|$|E

In floral axes, floral branches and stems with floral branches, free IAA levels (dry weight) were 387, 253, and 417 nanograms, and bound IAA levels were 99, 1089, and 268 nanograms.

Since flower-forming ability of excised cells from the epidermis and subepidermis shows a gradient in an in vitro system, but levels of IAA in these tissues do not, there thus appears to be no correlation between flower-forming ability (in vitro) and endogenous IAA levels (at the time of excision) in <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> tissues...|$|E

A significant proportion of 3 H–trans-cinnamic acid formed from 3 H–L-phenylalanine did not equilibrate with exogenous trans-cinnamic acid and therefore may be rapidly channeled through the cinnamate 4 -hydroxylase (C 4 H) reaction to 4 -coumaric acid. Such compartmentalization of trans-cinnamic acid was not observed after elicitation or in cell cultures constitutively expressing a bean phenylalanine ammonia–lyase (PAL) transgene.

Translucent and soft callus was obtained at higher concentration (l- 40 mg/l) of NAA or lower concentration (O-O. 2 mg/l) of kinetin. Microscopic observations of the thin sectioned callus tissues revieled that the green colored compact tissue was composed of the closely associated small cells and many tracheid-like structures, while in the translucent and soft tissue, large cells were roughly arranged showing less association and no tracheidlike structure was found. TMV was maintained at high concentration in the compact callus during successive cultures, however, {{it was no longer}} detected beyond the third generation (90 days) in the translucent soft callus grown under the optimum hormone balances.

Ovalbumin, with a molecular weight of 45 kDa and a molecular diameter of 5. 4 nm, is an inert, water-soluble protein that is midway along the size range of endogenous xylem sap proteins. Solutions of ovalbumin conjugated to a fluorescent marker and supplied to transpiring shoot explants of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and olive (Olea europaea L.) were shown by confocal laser scanning microscopy to accumulate specifically at wall-based pit membranes that connect neighbouring xylem conduits. In addition, pressure-induced perfusion of micro-filtered ovalbumin solutions, at concentrations {{similar to those of}} endogenous xylem sap proteins, through the xylem of <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> or olive twig segments resulted in the retention of c. 40 % of the ovalbumin and reductions in the axial hydraulic conductance of the xylem. Smaller molecules such as Texas Red 3000 (MW 3 kDa) and Alexafluor 488 –cadaverin conjugates (MW 0. 64 kDa) did not show similar characteristics. The partial reduction in xylem hydraulic conductance appeared {{to be related to the}} accumulation of ovalbumin at xylem pit membranes and the consequent fouling of trans-membrane water-conducting pores with smaller diameters than those of the ovalbumin molecules.

Larvae of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> weevil, Trichobaris mucorea, burrow into stems of Nicotiana attenuata and feed on the pith. Transgenic N. attenuata lines silenced in signaling and foliar defense traits were evaluated in a 2 -year field study for resistance against attack by naturally occurring T. mucorea larva. Plants silenced in early jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis (antisense [as]-lipoxygenase 3 [lox 3]; inverted repeat [ir]-allene oxide cyclase), JA perception (as-coronatine insensitive 1), proteinase inhibitors (ir-pi), and nicotine (ir-putrescine methyl-transferase) direct defenses and lignin (ir-cad) biosynthesis were infested more frequently than wild-type plants. Plants unable to emit C 6 aldehydes (as-hpl) had lower infestation rates, while plants silenced in late steps in JA biosynthesis (ir-acyl-coenzyme A oxidase, ir-opr) and silenced in diterpene glycoside production (ir-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase) did not differ from wild type. Pith choice assays revealed that ir-putrescine methyl-transferase, ir-coronatine insensitive 1, and ir-lox 3 pith, which all had diminished nicotine levels, were preferred by larvae compared to wild-type pith. The lack of preference for ir-lox 2 and ir-cad piths, suggest that oviposition attraction and vascular defense, rather than pith palatability accounts for the higher attack rates observed for these plants. We conclude that traits that influence a plant’s apparency, stem hardness, and pith direct defenses all contribute to resistance against this herbivore whose attack can be devastating to N. attenuata’s fitness...|$|E

This chimeric gene was used to transform tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In R 2 etiolated transgenic tobacco seedlings, GUS expression occurred primarily in elongation regions of hypocotyls and roots. In green plants, GUS was expressed primarily in the epidermis and cortex of stems and petioles, {{as well as in}} elongation regions of anther filaments in developing flowers.

The protein moiety of GBGP constitutes about one-half of the molecule (w/w) and contains lysine (16 %), proline (12 %), hydroxyproline (10 %), tyrosine (4 %), alanine (7 %), leucine (6 %), and cystine (1. 4 %).

CBM-labelling studies revealed that CBM 29 - 1 - 2 binds indiscriminately to every tissue of the wild-type <b>tobacco</b> <b>stem</b> whereas binding of CBM 2 b- 1 - 2 was restricted to vascular tissue. The promiscuous CBM 29 - 1 - 2 had much more pronounced effects on transgenic tobacco plants than the less promiscuous CBM 2 b- 1 - 2. Reduced stem elongation and prolonged juvenility, resulting in delayed flower development, were observed in transformants expressing CBM 29 - 1 - 2 whereas such growth phenotypes were not observed for CBM 2 b- 1 - 2 plants. Histological examination and electron microscopy revealed layers of collapsed cortical cells in the stems of CBM 29 - 1 - 2 plants whereas cellular deformation in the stem cortical cells of CBM 2 b- 1 - 2 transformants was less severe. Altered cell expansion was also observed {{in most parts of}} the CBM 29 - 1 - 2 stem whereas for the CBM 2 b- 1 - 2 stem this was observed in the xylem cells only.

Mutants M 2 and M 88 died rapidly in planta and failed to produce necrosis when infiltrated in tobacco leaves or to cause wilting when injected in <b>tobacco</b> <b>stems.</b> Complemented strains M 2 * and M 88 * were respectively obtained from mutants M 2 and M 88 by transformation with a DNA fragment harboring gene rfaF. They had a different degree of wild-type reconstituted phenotype. Both strains retained the rough phenotype of the mutants, and their LPS electrophoretic patterns were intermediate between those of the wild type and those of the mutants...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the use of tobacco {{products}} is now no doubt a hot topic worldwide and especially in Europe, we are the last few years witnessed fundamental changes in the legislation of many countries on the tobacco control. Although today's situation resulted from day to day and " hotbed " for change societal perceptions of tobacco consumption actually were born since the 50 th 20 th cent., after all in terms of global -scale changes relatively quickly and therefore often brings considerable controversy. The area of public health, I chose as my topic thesis for several reasons. The first is my longtime interest of addiction in general - in high school, I engaged in various extensive works of this field. Another factor is certainly closer to the issue <b>Tobacco</b> <b>stemming</b> from long-term cooperation with Czech Coalition against Tobacco. thanks her work {{for more than two years}} as a consultant on line for smoking cessation and I have been on several other projects of the association (eg, preventive programs for elementary schools or support actions for employees smoke- enterprises). Finally, he played the role of a simple fact that smoking is now the most important preventable cause of premature death and medical point of view, therefore, this phenomenon has a special status and yet it seems that the topic [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Any {{kind of an}} old loft {{served as}} a cigar shop. If there were enough windows, we had {{sufficient}} light for our work; if not, it was apparently no concern of the management.... Cigar shops were always dusty from the <b>tobacco</b> <b>stems</b> and powdered leaves. Benches and work tables were not designed to enable the workmen to adjust bodies and arms comfortably to work surface. Each workman supplied his own cutting board of lignum vitae and knife blade.The tobacco leaf was prepared by strippers who drew the leaves from the heavy stem {{and put them into}} pads of about fifty. The leaves had to be handled carefully to prevent tearing. The craftsmanship of the cigarmaker was shown in his ability to utilize wrappers to the best advantage to shave off the unusable to a hairbreadth, to roll so as to cover holes in the leaf and to use both hands so as to make a perfectly shaped and rolled product. These things a good cigarmaker learned to do more or less mechanically, which left us free to think, talk, listen, or sing. I loved the freedom of that work, for I had earned the mind-freedom that accompanied skill as a craftsman. I was eager to learn from discussion and reading or to pour out my feelings in song.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} bioassay {{is described}} for {{a factor that}} promotes tumor growth which was first obtained from extracts of pinto bean leaves with crown gall tumors. Sixteen primary pinto bean leaves per sample are inoculated with sufficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens to initiate about 5 to 10 tumors per leaf and treated with tumor growth factor at day 3 after inoculation. The diameters of 30 to 48 round tumors (no more than 3 randomly selected per leaf) are measured per test sample at day 6. Mean tumor diameter increased linearly with the logarithm of the concentration of tumor growth factor applied. The tumor growth factor was separated by column chromatography from an ultraviolet light-absorbing compound previously reported {{to be associated with}} fractions having maximal tumor growth factor activity. Partly purified tumor growth factor showed no activity in a cytokinin bioassay or an auxin bioassay, and negligible activity in gibberellin bioassays. Representatives of these three classes of growth factors did not promote tumor growth. Extracts from crown gall tumors on primary pinto bean leaves, primary castor bean leaves, Bryophyllum leaves, carrot root slices, and <b>tobacco</b> <b>stems</b> showed tumor growth factor activity, whereas extracts from healthy control tissues did not. Extracts from actively growing parts of healthy pinto beans, Bryophyllum, and tobacco, however, showed tumor growth factor activity. Tumor growth factor is proposed to be a normal plant growth factor associated with rapidly growing tissues. Its synthesis may be activated in nongrowing tissues by infection with Agrobacterium sp...|$|R
5000|$|The Southern Negro Youth Congress {{was caught}} in two {{spontaneous}} strikes that occurred in Richmond, Virginia in 1937. The first strike occurred on April 16, 1937 against the Carrington & Michaux <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Stemming</b> Company. The second strike occurred on May 7, 1937 against the I. N. Vaughn & Company. At the time, the tobacco industry already had an established tobacco union, The Tobacco Workers’ International Union, which followed the policy of occupational segregation rather than racial discrimination which allowed them to ignore the rights and needs of African-American workers. In {{order to get the}} black workers organized, the Southern Negro Youth Congress sent a field representative, C. Columbus Alston. In addition to {{being a member of the}} Southern Negro Youth Congress, Alston was also a union member of the Youth Committee of the American Federation of Labor and helped organize the black workers into the Tobacco Stemmers and Laborers Industrial Union. With the help of Alston and Southern Negro Youth Congress, the Tobacco Stemmers and Laborers Industrial Union was able to draft a list of demands aimed at the Tobacco companies. Some of the demands listed by the black tobacco workers consisted of having higher wages, shorter working-hours and better working conditions. Within 48 hours of the union’s committee presenting its case to the management of the company, an agreement was reached with Frank Kruch of the State Labor Department and the owners of the companies.|$|R
