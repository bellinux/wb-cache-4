40|$|Radio and X-ray {{emission}} from {{brown dwarfs}} suggest that an ionised gas and {{a magnetic field}} with a sufficient flux density must be present. We perform a reference study for late M-dwarfs, brown dwarfs and giant gas planet to identify which ultra-cool objects are most susceptible to plasma and magnetic processes. Only <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation</b> is considered. We utilise the Drift-Phoenix model grid where the local atmospheric structure {{is determined by the}} global parameters T_ eff, (g) and [M/H]. Our results show that it is not unreasonable to expect H_α or radio emission to origin from Brown Dwarf atmospheres as in particular the rarefied upper parts of the atmospheres can be magnetically coupled despite having low degrees of thermal gas ionisation. Such ultra-cool atmospheres could therefore drive auroral emission without the need for a companion's wind or an outgassing moon. The minimum threshold for the magnetic flux density required for electrons and ions to be magnetised is well above typical values of the global magnetic field of a brown dwarf and a giant gas planet. Na^+, K^+ and Ca^+ are the dominating electron donors in low-density atmospheres (low log(g), solar metallicity) independent of T_ eff. Mg^+ and Fe^+ dominate the <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation</b> in the inner parts of M-dwarf atmospheres. Molecules remain unimportant for <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation.</b> Chemical processes (e. g. cloud formation) affecting the most abundant electron donors, Mg and Fe, will have a direct impact on the state of ionisation in ultra-cool atmospheres.

In order to explore why, I modeled the contamination with Wolf-Rayet star ejecta of metal-poor (Z= 0. 001) HII regions, ionised either by a 10 ^ 6 M_sun cluster of coeval stars (cluster 1), or a cluster resulting from continuous star formation {{at a rate of}} 1 M_sun yr^- 1 (cluster 2). The clusters have Z= 0. 001 and a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) from 0. 1 to 120 M_sun. Independent one dimensional constant density simulations of the emission-line spectra of unenriched HII regions were computed at the discrete ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Myr, with the photoionisation code CLOUDY, using as input, radiative and mechanical stellar feedbacks predicted by the evolutionary synthesis code STARBURST 99.

40|$|Using a {{time-dependent}} multifluid, magnetohydrodynamic code, {{we calculated}} {{the structure of}} steady perpendicular and oblique C-type shocks in dusty plasmas. We included relevant processes to describe mass transfer between the different fluids, radiative cooling by emission lines and grain charging and studied the effect of single-sized and multiple sized grains on the shock structure. Our models are the first of oblique fast-mode molecular shocks in which such a rigorous treatment of the dust grain dynamics has been combined with a self-consistent calculation of the <b>thermal</b> and <b>ionisation</b> structures including appropriate microphysics. At low densities the grains do not play any {{significant role in the}} shock dynamics. At high densities, the ionisation fraction is sufficiently low that dust grains are important charge and current carriers and, thus, determine the shock structure. We find that the magnetic field in the shock front has a significant rotation out of the initial upstream plane. This is most pronounced for single-sized grains and small angles of the shock normal with the magnetic field. Our results are similar to previous studies of steady C-type shocks showing that our method is efficient, rigorous and robust. Unlike the method employed in the previous most detailed treatment of dust in steady oblique fast-mode shocks, ours allows a reliable calculation even when chemical or other conditions deviate from local statistical equilibrium. We are also able to model transient phenomena. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Outflows {{of young}} stars drive shocks into dusty, {{molecular}} regions. Most models of such shocks {{assume that they}} are steady and propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field. Real shocks often violate both of these assumptions and the media through which they propagate are inhomogeneous. We use the code employed previously to produce the first time-dependent simulations of fast-mode, oblique C-type shocks interacting with density perturbations. We include a self-consistent calculation of the <b>thermal</b> and <b>ionisation</b> balances and a fluid treatment of grains. We identify features that develop when a multifluid shock encounters a density inhomogeneity to investigate whether {{any part of the}} precursor region ever behaves in a quasi-steady fashion. If it does the shock may be modelled approximately without solving the time-dependent hydromagnetic equations. Simulations were made for initially steady oblique C-type shocks encountering density inhomogeneities. For a semi-finite inhomogeneity with a density larger than the surrounding medium, a transmitted shock evolves from being J-type to a steady C-type shock on a timescale comparable to the ion-flow time through it. A sufficiently upstream part of the precursor of an evolving J-type shock is quasi-steady. The ion-flow timescale is also relevant for the evolution of a shock moving into a region of decreasing density. The models for shocks propagating into regions in which the density increases and then decreases to its initial value cannot be entirely described in terms of the results obtained for monotonically increasing and decreasing densities. For the latter model, the long-term evolution to a C-type shock cannot be approximated by quasi-steady models. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of {{evidence to support the}} contention that the atmospheric Pb burden is now considerably greater {{than it was in the}} remote past. However, as there are a diversity of potential environmental pathways leading to Pb ingestion, it is not clear how atmospheric Pb levels relate to human exposure. It is necessary to establish a baseline for human exposure to Pb from natural sources in the pre-metallurgical past, with which contemporary exposure can be compared. This paper addresses this issue by comparing the Pb content of human dental enamel — an established proxy for Pb exposure — from modern and archaeological, pre-metallurgical individuals using <b>thermal</b> and plasma <b>ionisation</b> mass spectrometry. It is shown that mean Neolithic enamel Pb contents are approximately 0. 31 ± 0. 04 ppm. These values are only one order of magnitude lower than previously reported data for the same tissues for modern juveniles, despite an established 400 -fold increase in the atmospheric Pb burden. The results suggest that ‘natural’ exposure to Pb in food and water may have been higher than previously thought, and that the link between atmospheric Pb and human exposure warrants further investigation. ...|$|R

We present a first investigation of the dependence of the breakdown conditions in Brown Dwarf and giant gas exoplanets on the local gas-phase chemistry, the effective temperature and primordial gas-phase metallicity.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of ultra-cool objects {{suggest that the}} gas in their uppermost atmospheres is heated, ionised and magnetised to levels that radio and X-ray emission is possible. The aim of this work is to identify which low mass objects are most susceptible to plasma and magnetic processes by the effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation</b> and Lyman continuum photoionisation from the irradiation of external sources in different environments. I focus my work on very low mass, ultra-cool objects (late M-dwarfs, brown dwarfs and giant gas planets: T[sub]eff = 1000... 3000 K) to analyse the electrostatic and magnetic character of these atmosphere. This work {{has been carried out}} in two distinct parts: a) A reference study to identify which ultra-cool objects are most susceptible to plasma and magnetic processes considering the <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation</b> as the only mechanism to ionise the atmospheric gas. This presents a theoretical framework using a set of fundamental parameters to analyse the ionisation and magnetic coupling state of objects with ultra-cool atmospheres. The DRIFT-PHOENIX model atmosphere simulations are used to determine the local gas properties T[sub]gas [K], p[sub]gas [bar], pₑ [bar] of the atmospheres structures from the global parameters T[sub]eff [K], log(g) [cm s[super]- 2] and [M/H]. Electrostatics interactions dominance over electron-neutral interactions increases as T[sub]eff increases: throughout the M-dwarf atmospheres, almost for the whole brown dwarf atmospheres and only giant gas planets with T[sub]eff = 1200 K, log(g) = 3. 0, [M/H]=+ 0. 3 fulfil that criterion at the most deeper atmosphere. A magnetised gas is found for M-dwarfs, brown dwarfs and giant gas planet atmospheres even for those with a small degree of ionisation except to the most deeper atmospheric regions. Hence, the upper atmosphere of all of studied objects can be magnetically coupled. A large fraction of the atmospheric volume of M-dwarfs and of early spectral subtypes of brown dwarfs is found to occur plasma processes and magnetised gas, and are therefore the best candidates to emit in Hα and radio wavelengths. b) An analysis of how the Lyman continuum external irradiation effect the plasma and magnetic state of an ultra-cool atmospheres in additional <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation.</b> The Monte Carlo radiative transfer code simulations provide the atmospheric ionisation structure due to photoionisation. Three different cases are studied to see the effect of the Lyman continuum irradiation given by an external source: free-floating ultra-cool objects irradiated by Lyman continuum photons from the interstellar medium (dominated by Galactic O and B stars), brown dwarfs in star forming regions irradiated by a nearby (few parsecs) O star and binary systems where a brown dwarf atmosphere is photoionised by a companion white dwarf. The effect of Lyman continuum irradiation from external sources greatly increases the level of ionisation in the uppermost atmospheric regions. Brown dwarfs in star forming regions and brown dwarfs in binary systems with a companion white dwarf have upper atmospheres that are close to being fully ionised. Adopting temperatures typical for a chromosphere or a corona, the resulting free-free X-ray luminosities are found to be comparable with those observed from brown dwarfs in star forming regions. The results of this study show that it is not unreasonable to expect powerful energy emissions from brown dwarf atmospheres. The conclusions of this study are that the <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation</b> allows the establishment of a magnetised plasma in brown dwarf atmospheres as in particular the rarefied upper parts of the atmospheres despite having low degrees of thermal gas ionisation and that the Lyman continuum photoionisation allows to argue for a chromosphere/corona on brown dwarfs and for X-ray emissions from ultra-cool objects. However, other mechanisms, like Alfvén wave heating, are needed to occur which then lead to rise the local gas temperature in the chromosphere/corona on brown dwarfs...|$|E

A half-life value of 1. 5867 (14) 10 5 a was obtained, in which the relative standard uncertainty amounts to 0. 09 %. The result {{is lower than the}} currently recommended value. JRC.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} highly precise method, {{which uses a}} borate fusion, of U and Pu {{determination}} in soils, sediments and other materials is described. The chemical separation steps are optimised by using an anion resin column stacked on an extraction chromatography column (Eichrom Industries UTEVA resin). The whole procedure was streamlined to measure 700 soil samples in 10 weeks {{as part of an}} urgent environmental monitoring programme. Uranium was measured using <b>thermal</b> <b>ionisation</b> mass spectrometry with a precision of 0. 2 % at the 95 % uncertainty level. Pu was measured using alpha spectrometry with a precision of approximately 10 % at the 95 % uncertainty level. The method can be applied successfully {{to a wide range of}} sample types and other actinide elements (Th, Am, etc.) can also be effectively included in the analytical scheme. The whole method has been critically evaluated by measuring a range of international reference samples...|$|E
