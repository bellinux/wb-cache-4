5|$|While {{there can}} be {{considerable}} variation across members of a species—and while <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> obviously impacted by the effects of moult and feather regeneration—even very closely related species show clear differences in their wing formulas.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{testing has}} also {{included}} {{the use of}} placebo testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered {{in order to determine}} any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> compared with those obtained with an active compound.|$|E
5000|$|By convention, {{the three}} primary colors in {{additive}} mixing are red, green, and blue. In {{the absence of}} color or, when no colors <b>are</b> showing, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> black. If all three primary colors <b>are</b> showing, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> white. When red and green combine, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> yellow. When red and blue combine, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> magenta. When blue and green combine, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> cyan.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> disputed by <b>the</b> Salt Institute (the salt producers' trade organisation), {{who demanded}} that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>be</b> handed over for {{re-analysis}}. [...] A re-analysis {{was published in}} 1996 and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> same. [...] <b>The</b> <b>results</b> have since <b>been</b> confirmed by the TOHP I and TOHP II studies.|$|R
5|$|In Shine Runners, {{the player}} must collect Shine Sprites (an object from Super Mario Sunshine). The player can attack other racers {{to take away}} a Shine Sprite from them, and racers with the fewest Shine Sprites are {{eliminated}} from the game over time. In single player, if the human player is eliminated from the round, the game ends and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> randomized.|$|E
5|$|Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) and Erin {{await the}} results of a DNA test to see if Erin is the {{daughter}} previously given up by Phyllis in high school. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> negative, but Phyllis holds off on telling Erin after Andy rejects Erin's proposal to start dating again, and continues to show maternal affection toward her.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{decided by}} a panel of judges from a list of {{submitted}} nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short-list of finalists. Ties can occur if the panel decides both entries show equal merit, however they are encouraged to choose a single winner.

5000|$|Future is a {{task that}} returns a <b>result.</b> <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> {{computed}} in a background thread encapsulated by the Future object, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> buffered until it is retrieved.

5000|$|Where {{one color}} (G1) <b>is</b> black (1.0), <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> [...] This {{will always be}} more than G2, so <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> more black than G2.|$|R
30|$|All the {{experiments}} were performed in triplicate and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> represented as mean ± standard deviation. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer comparison test.|$|R
5|$|While HIAG only {{partially}} achieved its goals {{of legal and}} economic rehabilitation of Waffen-SS, its propaganda efforts led to the reshaping {{of the image of}} Waffen-SS in popular culture. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> still felt, with scholarly treatments being outweighed by a large amount of amateur historical studies, memoirs, picture books, websites and wargames.|$|E
5|$|While {{significant}} {{attempts have}} been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> {{processed}} with a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test using “Statistica 8 ” program. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> {{presented as}} mean[*]±[*]standard deviation. p[*]<[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R

50|$|If the ellipse is {{rotated about}} its major axis, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a prolate (elongated) spheroid, {{shaped like a}}n American {{football}} or rugby ball. If the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> an oblate (flattened) spheroid, shaped like a lentil. If the generating ellipse <b>is</b> a circle, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a sphere. A spheroid has circular symmetry.|$|R

25|$|High {{doses of}} {{temozolomide}} in high-grade gliomas yield low toxicity, but <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{comparable to the}} standard doses.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{most common}} <b>result</b> of an {{overflow}} {{is that the}} least significant representable bits of <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>are</b> stored; <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> said to wrap around the maximum (i.e. modulo power of two).|$|R

25|$|Analysis of banded {{chromosomes}} is done at {{a microscope}} by a clinical laboratory specialist in cytogenetics (CLSp(CG)). Generally 20 cells are analyzed which {{is enough to}} rule out mosaicism to an acceptable level. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> summarized and given to a board-certified cytogeneticist for review, and to write an interpretation {{taking into account the}} patients previous history and other clinical findings. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> then given out reported in an International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature 2009 (ISCN2009).|$|E

25|$|Most {{lissencephaly}} {{cases are}} associated with deletions of mutations of the LIS1 gene and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> usually more severe in the posterior brain regions.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} a multidisciplinary approach involving medications, physical and occupational therapy, psychological treatments, and neuromodulation. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> often unsatisfactory, especially if treatment is delayed.|$|E
