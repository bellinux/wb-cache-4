40|$|The digital {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} new technologies of communication are dramatically changing language learning practices but also writing practices, whether in one’s mother tongue, in a second language or in a foreign language. In the framework of international research based on the development <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> ability among students of a second language or a foreign language in the university context, we have sought to better understand {{the way in which the}} relationship to writing (Barré de Miniac, 1997; Blaser and Chartrand, 2010) is constructed by these students in this new era. This article is intended to share the results of a survey conducted among some 200 students of French as a second language or a foreign language in four contrasting geographical and linguistic contexts. After a description of the ways in which students claim to use these new technologies at the university, we will analyze their use <b>of</b> ICTS when <b>writing</b> longer texts in an academic setting. Next, we will look into the functions served by the Internet at every step <b>of</b> the <b>writing</b> process, i. e. the different stages of planning, drafting and revising (Hayes et Flower, 1980). Finally, we will consider the kinds of tools used for the drafting <b>of</b> <b>these</b> various <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818), {{written by}} Mary Shelley some {{twenty years after}} the French Revolution, has been subject to many {{theories}} and speculations since it was published. Many critics have wondered {{how it is possible}} that a girl of eighteen in the nineteenth century could write such a novel and what her inspiration could have been to come up with such a curious invention. Mary Shelley’s monster and its master Victor Frankenstein are famous to the degree that, ironically, they overshadow their creator. To gain more insight into the novel and the idea behind it, it is interesting to consider to which extent Mary Shelley employed notions of enlightenment and revolutionary thought. Shelley’s parents Godwin and Wollstonecraft participated in the so-called ‘pamphlet war’, a quarrel on paper between progressive and conservative writers and/or activists that was at its height during the 1790 s. Edmund Burke, originally an Irishman and former supporter of the American Revolution, did not regard the French Revolution with quite the same amount of enthusiasm as Godwin, Wollstonecraft and other enlightened writers did. Political pamphlets advocating the rights of man began to appear everywhere in answer to Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). Writers of the Jacobin dissent reacted to Burke and other conservatives and they seized {{this as an opportunity to}} attack the established gentry. Godwin’s most important political and philosophical work was written during this time entitled An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793). Even before Godwin, Wollstonecraft had published The Rights of Man (1790). During these years Wollstonecraft would publish her most famous work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), which had great influence on authors moving in the same circles as she did. Godwin would later publish his political thriller Things As They Are; Or the Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794), which was an attempt to apply his abstract theories to a more realistic situation. Both <b>these</b> last <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> will be used in analyzing Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. She did not write her novel out of a blank slate but instead based large parts of it on the works of her parents. The legacy of her parents, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin and simultaneously the French Revolution can be found in many different concepts, positive and negative, which Mary Shelley incorporated into her novel Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{assassination}} attempt on Louis Philippe in July 1835, a {{law was passed}} on 9 September 1835 forbidding political caricatures and articles critical of the king. In light of the subsequent fines and imprisonments imposed on the press for violations of this law, Traviès, {{like many of his}} colleagues, turned his attention to satirizing French customs and culture. He also provided illustrations for Balzac's La Comédie humaine and Eugène Sue's Les Mystères de Paris as well as producing many depictions of the Parisian poor and their daily life. Baudelaire, who was an admirer of his work, including <b>these</b> later <b>pieces,</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> Traviès: He is the prince of the unfortunate. His muse is a nymph of the suburbs, pale and melancholy. ... Traviès has a deep feeling for the joys and sorrows of the common people. He knows the scoundrel thoroughly, and he loves him with tender charity. For this reason his Scènes Bachiques will remain a remarkable work.When Baudelaire wrote these words in 1857 he observed that Traviès had been inexplicably [...] "missing from the scene" [...] for quite a while. After 1845 Traviès had worked more and more sporadically. The last fourteen years of his life were marked by depression and illness. However, he exhibited portraits in the 1848 and 1855 Paris Salons and finally managed to complete his religious painting Christ et la Samaritaine which was exhibited in the 1853 Salon and bought by the French government. He died in his Paris apartment on 13 August 1859 at the age of 55. According to contemporary obituaries, he died in poverty lying on a straw bed.|$|R
