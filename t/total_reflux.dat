We assessed whether these improve the diagnostic yield of impedance pH monitoring of reflux disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of consecutive patients with proton pump inhibitor-responsive heartburn who underwent 24 -hour impedance pH monitoring at hospitals in Italy from January 2011 through December 2013. Reviewers blindly analyzed off-therapy impedance pH tracings from 289 patients with proton pump inhibitor-responsive heartburn, 68 with erosive reflux disease and 221 with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), along with 50 healthy individuals (controls).

To determine whether laparoscopic anterior fundoplication gives the same degree of antireflux control as a total fundoplication, we analyzed a prospectively followed cohort of patients from randomized controlled trials of laparoscopic antireflux surgery. There were 167 patients who returned for routine esophageal pH studies within 6 months of surgery (123 laparoscopic total fundoplications and 44 anterior fundoplications).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Air {{plethysmography}} {{has been}} useful in assessing {{patients who have}} chronic venous insufficiency. Limb reflux times determined by color-flow–assisted duplex scanning {{have been shown to}} correlate with the severity of chronic venous insufficiency. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare air plethysmographic measurements with reflux times obtained by color-flow–assisted duplex scanning in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Methods: One hundred twenty-two limbs in 61 consecutive patients with various stages of chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated; air plethysmographic and color-flow assisted duplex scans were performed at the same sitting. Fifty-nine of the patients had venous ulceration. Values obtained by air plethysmographic scans included venous filling index, ejection volume, residual volume, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction. Color-flow assisted duplex scan values included reflux times in the deep and superficial venous segments and total and mean limb reflux times. Results: Using the Pearson correlation, the venous filling index was found to correlate significantly with <b>total</b> limb venous <b>reflux</b> times, mean <b>total</b> limb <b>reflux</b> times, and venous reflux times in the deep venous system, as determined by color-flow assisted duplex scans (p < 0. 001).

METHODS: We prospectively assessed the presence of technetium ((99) Tc) in the upper, middle, and lower esophagus of 25 wheezing babies (13 with GERD and 12 without GERD) using scintigraphy. Both groups underwent clinical investigation, including laboratory, X-ray and scintigraphy tests, for the etiology of the wheezing baby syndrome (WBS) and GERD.

(1) {{on the role of}} robot-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication in the treatment of PPI-refractory GERD patients as diagnosed by on-PPI impedance-pH monitoring. We must congratulate with the authors as they clearly demonstrated the efficacy of anti-reflux surgery in PPI-refractory GERD patients, including a long-term (3 years) evaluation to reinforce their findings. They clearly showed that the major therapeutic gain of surgery relies on the reduction of weakly acidic reflux episodes, but we argue that some points of the study need to be discussed more in depth.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) in {{children}} primarily aims to decrease reflux events and reduce reflux symptoms {{in children}} with therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The aim was to objectively assess the effect and efficacy of LARS in pediatric GERD patients and to identify parameters associated with failure of LARS. METHODS: Twenty-five children with GERD [12 males, median age 6 (2 - 18) years] were included prospectively. Reflux-specific questionnaires, stationary manometry, 24 -h multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring (MII-pH monitoring) and a 13 C-labeled Na-octanoate breath test were used for clinical assessment before and 3 months after LARS. RESULTS: After LARS, three of 25 patients had persisting/recurrent reflux symptoms (one also had persistent pathological acid exposure on MII-pH monitoring). New-onset dysphagia was present in three patients after LARS. Total acid exposure time (AET) (8. 5 - 0. 8 %; p < 0. 0001) and <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> episodes (p < 0. 001) significantly decreased and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) resting pressure significantly increased (10 - 24 mmHg, p < 0. 0001) after LARS.

40|$|Background. Perioperative {{lidocaine}} {{treatment is}} commonly used in horses that undergo surgical treatment of colic, to prevent or treat postoperative ileus and reduce the effects of intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury. However, its clinical efficacy has not been evaluated in a large population of horses undergoing small intestinal surgery. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate whether systemic lidocaine administration reduced the prevalence, volume and duration of postoperative reflux and improved rates of survival following surgical treatment of small intestinal lesions. Data were collected as a part of two prospective studies investigating postoperative survival of surgical colic patients admitted to a UK equine referral hospital during the periods 2004 – 2006 and 2012 – 2014. Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative probability of survival and the log-rank test were used to compare survival between horses that did or did not receive lidocaine. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the <b>total</b> <b>reflux</b> volume and duration of reflux between the groups. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify pre- and intraoperative risk factors for non-survival. Results: Data from 318 horses were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of postoperative reflux was 24. 5 %. This was significantly higher (34. 8 %) in horses admitted in 2012 – 2014 compared to the 2004 – 2006 cohort (16. 7). Perioperative lidocaine treatment had no effect on <b>total</b> <b>reflux</b> volume, duration of reflux or rates of postoperative survival nor was it a risk factor associated with altered postoperative survival. Variables identified to be associated with increased risk of postoperative mortality included packed cell volume on admission (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 03 95 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 004 – 1. 06, p[*]=[*] 0. 024), heart rate on admission (HR 1. 014, 95 % CI 1. 004 – 1. 024, p = 0. 008) and duration of surgery (HR 1. 007, 95 % CI 1. 002 – 1. 01, p[*]=[*] 0. 008).

The <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> episodes per hour in the supine position was significantly lower than in the remaining time (p&#x 003 C; 0. 0001). Having excluded the 2 h-postprandial time, the difference was still statistically significant (p&#x 003 C; 0. 002). The <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> episodes per hour in 1 h- and 2 h-postprandial time was significantly higher than in the upright position excluding the respective postprandial time (p&#x 003 C; 0. 0001). No statistically significant difference in the number of episodes lasting longer than five minutes per hour in the supine and in the upright position was stated. There were more episodes lasting longer than five minutes per hour in the postprandial time than in the upright position in the remaining time (1 h- and 2 h-postprandial time excluded &# 8211; p&#x 003 C; 0. 004 and p&#x 003 C; 0. 002, respectively). RI was higher in the upright than in supine position (p&#x 003 C; 0. 0001). However, after the exclusion of 2 h-postprandial time, no significant differences in RI were found. In conclusion, a high frequency of GERD in CF patients regardless of the presence/absence of typical clinical manifestation was documented. Reflux index was higher in postprandial time. In the supine position, there was a tendency towards less frequent and longer lasting reflux episodes...|$|R
40|$|Background & aims: In a {{group of}} {{children}} with suspected pulmonary aspiration, we aimed to describe the type and physical characteristics of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) episodes, and to determine their correlation with the lipid-laden macrophage (LLM) content in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Patients and methods: Twenty-one children with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma, recurrent lung consolidations and recurrent laryngotracheitis underwent 24 -h multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring, fibreoptic bronchoscopy and BAL. The following parameters were evaluated: <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> episodes, number of acid reflux [AR: pH 4], height of reflux episodes, LLM content and percentage of neutrophils in the BAL. Results: The number of NAR episodes and the number of those reaching the proximal oesophagus were significantly higher in patients with recurrent lung consolidations than ill those with bronchial asthma and laryngotracheitis (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 01). BAL studies showed a significantly higher LLM content in children with recurrent lung consolidations than in those with bronchial asthma and laryngotracheitis (p < 0. 01). The LLM content correlated significantly with the <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> episodes (r = 0. 73; p < 0. 001) and with those reaching the proximal oesophagus (r = 0. 67 : p < 0. 001). Finally, the LLM content cot-related with the number of NAR episodes (r = 0. 61 : p < 0. 01), with those reaching the proximal oesophagus (r = 0. 64 : p < 0. 01) and with the percentage of BAL neutrophils (r = 0. 7; p < 0. 01). Conclusion: NAR episodes reaching the proximal oesophagus correlate with diagnostic marker for Pulmonary micro-aspiration. MII-pH monitoring increases the yield in identifying types and proximal extension of reflux episodes, that discriminate between patients with and without pulmonary aspiration.

40|$|Background The day-to-day {{variability}} {{in the number of}} reflux episodes and symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease is high; therefore, the assessment of reflux disease based on 24 -h monitoring may be inaccurate. Aims The aim {{of the study was to}} compare prolonged (48 h) and standard (24 h) pH-impedance monitoring (pH-MII). Methods Fifty-four consecutive patients with typical and atypical reflux symptoms underwent 48 -h pH-MII. Acid exposure time (AET), <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> episodes (TR), number of symptoms, and symptom association probability (SAP) were analyzed after the first 24 h and compared with the results obtained during 48 h of monitoring. Results The differences between the fractions of patients with normal and abnormal total AET and TR on both days were not significant. The percentage of patients wit...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a seven plate, pilot plant type {{continuous}} bubble cap distillation column is used. Process dynamic equations are derived using lumped parameter approach, state variables and state equations. The plate efficiency used is 57 %, which is calculated using <b>total</b> <b>reflux</b> condition. Using state equations, theoretical step responses for feed composition change, feed flow rate change, and reflux rate changes are calculated. These are compared with experimental data. Closed loop response studies are done using P and P-I controller to control top product composition by varying reflux. Since D-action software is not working, so P-D and P-I-D are not tested. Conclusions are drawn about the settings {{to be used}} on computer- controlled distillation column...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the mass {{transfer}} performance of rotating packed beds applying the "Higee" process. The operations were carried out with the n-hexane/n-heptane distilling system at atmospheric pressure and under <b>total</b> <b>reflux</b> conditions. The rotating speed could be varied between 300 and 2500 rpm, which provided centrifugal forces from 5 to 316 times the Earth's gravity. The effects of concentration, vapor velocity, rotating speed and packing type (two different Raschig ring sizes and structured wire mesh packing) on mass transfer behavior were analyzed. Experimental {{results showed that the}} mass transfer coefficient depends on the liquid flow rates and rotating speed. The equipment had high separation efficiency in a reduced bed volume...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: High-resolution {{manometry}} (HRM) {{provides information}} on esophagogastric junction (EGJ) morphology, distinguishing three different subtypes. Data on the correlation between EGJ subtypes and impedance-pH detected reflux patterns are lacking. We aimed to correlate the EGJ subtypes with impedance-pH findings in patients with reflux symptoms. METHODS: Consecutive patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were enrolled. All patients underwent HRM and impedance-pH testing off-therapy. EGJ was classified as: Type I, no separation between the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and crural diaphragm (CD); Type II, minimal separation (> 1 and < 2 cm); Type III, ≥ 2 cm separation. We measured esophageal acid exposure time (AET), number of <b>total</b> <b>reflux</b> episodes and symptom association analysis. KEY RESULTS: We enrolled 130 consecutive patients and identified 46. 2...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Urinary reflux is a {{probable}} reason of nephrolithiasis among children. This study aimed {{to assess the}} relationship between urinary reflux and other reason of stone formation in children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out with 199 children diagnosed with nephrolithiasis using ultrasonography. They were hospitalized in a referral children hospital in an urban area of in Iran. This study was conducted between 2014 and 2016. The presence of urinary reflux was assessed and graded by using the voiding cystourthrography modality. Results: Overall, 83. 9 % of the children had normal conditions regarding urinary reflux, while 1. 5 % had reflux grade I, 5. 5 % reflux grade II, 8. 1 % reflux grade III, and 1 % reflux grade IV with the <b>total</b> urinary <b>reflux</b> rate of 16. 1 %. The most prevalent observed clinical manifestation was irritability (45. 2 %) followed by fever (45. 2 %), and dysuria (19. 6 %). Also, no relationship was reported between the size of stones in both kidneys {{and the presence of}} reflux and its reflux. Furthermore, the size of stones in left and right kidneys was not related to hematuria, pyuria, and urinary tract infection. Conclusion: Vesicoureteral reflux and kidney stones in children may have interdependent identities. Therefore, the presence of reflux may not be a decisive reason for the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis...|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the study by Cheng et al, 1 who investigated patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refractory to antisecretory therapy by means of endoscopy and impedance-pH monitoring offtherapy and concluded that roughly half of these patients referred for testing actually underwent investigations and received medications with no evidence of GERD; they were affected by functional heartburn, functional disorders other than heartburn, or by undetermined disorders. These data confirm previous studies 2, 3 {{on the importance of}} investigating refractory patients and also emphasize the need of stopping antisecretory therapy to reduce overuse of proton pump inhibitors. 4 However, we believe that the decision taken by the authors of using the impedance-pH parameters (ie, number of reflux episodes) rather than the symptom association analysis for the categorization of nonerosive reflux disease patients requires further comments. Although the number of reflux episodes has been shown as a reproducible parameter in patients investigated twice with impedance-pH testing, its role for the diagnosis and management of patients with GERD is still unknown. To the best of our knowledge, to date, only 1 retrospective study focused its attention on this issue. Frazzoni et al 5 reported that one-third of their refractory patients with remission of persistent symptoms at 3 -year follow-up after surgical fundoplication had an abnormal distal number of <b>total</b> <b>refluxes</b> as the only preoperative impedance-pH finding. This suggests that this parameter is promising for GERD management, but further outcome studies are mandatory. On the other hand, a recent study by Patel et al 6 emphasized the importance of the impedancedetected reflux-symptom association to predict a positive outcome after medical or surgical therapy. Thus, unless further data will be available on the importance of reflux numbers and because of the emerging advantages provided by impedance to symptoms analysis, we believe such approach should be preferred when investigating patients with suspected refractory GERD, particularly when the pretest probability of GERD diagnosis is low. Moreover, we think that the 95 th percentile value of 73, set as the upper limit of normality in a previous article on healthy volunteers, should be regarded with caution. Recently, the French Group of Neuro-Gastroenterology modified their original cutoff from 75 to 53. 7 The explanation provided by these authors was that after a decade of impedance-pH experience, a more careful manual evaluation of impedance-pH tracings permitted to reduce significantly the number of false-positive episodes detected by current available software. Interestingly, in 2006 we published our set of normal values, and we found a 95 th percentile value of 54, which is in line with that observed by the French Group of Neuro-Gastroenterology. 8 As a consequence, a considerable proportion of patients classified by the authors as “hypersensitive” or “functional” could instead be subjects with a non-acid reflux disease who may benefit from different therapeutic approaches (ie, surgery instead of visceral pain modulator). Therefore, further studies on normal impedance values are desirable to confirm previous data...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased {{body weight}} is {{associated}} with higher intragastric pressure. Proximal extent of reflux is a determinant of symptoms in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and abdominal circumference on the incidence and proximal extent of <b>reflux.</b> METHODS: A <b>total</b> of 95 patients [37 men, age 51 (16 - 82)  years] with typical and/or atypical GERD symptoms underwent 24  h impedance-pH monitoring. Forty-nine patients were studied 'off' and 46 'on' proton pump inhibitors (PPI) treatment. Reflux was classified as acid (pH <  4) or weakly acidic (pH 4 - 7). Proximal extent {{was defined as the}} number of reflux events reaching ≥ 15  cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. Body mass index and abdominal circumference (cm) were assessed. KEY RESULTS: In patients 'off' PPI, there was a correlation between BMI and esophageal acid exposure (ρ =  0. 53, P <  0. 001), volume exposure (ρ =  0. 48, P <  0. 001), <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> events (ρ =  0. 47, P <  0. 001) and number of acid reflux events (ρ =  0. 49, P <  0. 001). In patients 'on' PPI there was a correlation between BMI and esophageal acid exposure (ρ =  0. 32, P =  0. 03), volume exposure (ρ =  0. 46, P <  0. 01) and <b>total</b> number of <b>reflux</b> events (ρ =  0. 33, P =  0. 03). Similar correlations were found between abdominal circumference and reflux. A correlation between BMI and proximal extent of reflux was present in patients 'off' PPI (ρ =  0. 32, P =  0. 03). In patients 'on' PPI, we found a correlation between abdominal circumference and proximal extent (ρ =  0. 31, P =  0. 03). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Body mass index and abdominal circumference may contribute to GER and its proximal extent, in patients 'on and 'off' PPI. Further studies investigating the role of weight reduction in the control of GERD symptoms are warranted. status: publishe...|$|R
