5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington <b>to</b> <b>Scott,</b> still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was {{in command of the}} militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E

5|$|At 23:00, the San Francisco {{aircraft}} spotted Jojima's force off Guadalcanal {{and reported}} it <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> Scott, believing that more Japanese ships were likely {{still on the}} way, continued his course towards {{the west side of}} Savo Island. At 23:33, Scott ordered his column to turn towards the southwest to a heading of 230°. All of Scott's ships understood the order as a column movement except Scott's own ship, San Francisco. As the three lead U.S. destroyers executed the column movement, San Francisco turned simultaneously. Boise—following immediately behind—followed San Francisco, thereby throwing the three van destroyers out of formation.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> dated 17 May 1907, to work {{to the east of}} the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground. In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
5|$|In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians {{for a new}} federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the faux pas and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1908, Nimrod sailed for the Antarctic from Lyttelton Harbour, New Zealand. Shackleton's {{original}} plans had envisaged {{using the}} old Discovery base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South Pole and South Magnetic Pole. Before leaving England, {{he had been}} pressured to give an undertaking <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> {{that he would not}} base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work. Shackleton reluctantly agreed to look for winter quarters at either the Barrier Inlet (which Discovery had briefly visited in 1902) or King Edward VII Land.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-five men (including replacements) {{formed the}} shore and ship's parties of the Terra Nova Expedition. They were chosen from 8,000applicants, and {{included}} seven Discovery veterans together with five {{who had been with}} Shackleton on his 1907–09 expedition. Lieutenant Edward Evans, who had been the navigating officer on Morning, the Discovery expedition's relief ship in 1904, was appointed Scott's second-in-command. He abandoned plans to mount his own expedition, and transferred his financial backing <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Scott's men {{reached an}} open prairie near the Wea {{settlement}} of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout {{and hurried to}} attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village {{on the other side}} of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{the film}} {{initially}} began in 2000, when Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment purchased the rights to a New York magazine story about {{the rise and fall}} of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter Steven Zaillian introduced a 170-page scriptment <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> Original production plans were to commence in Toronto for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with Terry George, it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout New York City and concluded in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E

5|$|M-79 starts {{south of}} Hastings at a {{three-way}} intersection with M-37 in Hastings Township. The trunkline runs east and parallel to {{a section of}} the Thornapple River through wooded terrain that is interspersed with farm fields. South of Thornapple Lake, M-79 angles southeasterly moving from Quimby Road <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> Road running parallel to the Thornapple River again into the community of Nashville. M-79 meets M-66 and turns south along the latter highway's route along Main and Durkee streets through the community. South of town in Maple Grove Township, M-79 separates from M-66 and turns east along Lawrence Road. Outside of Charlotte, M-79 curves southeast to transition to Lawrence Avenue through town. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with Cochran Avenue, which carries BLI-69 and M-50.|$|E
5|$|MetroLink began {{service on}} July 31, 1993, {{with the opening}} of the Red Line segment from North Hanley to 5th & Missouri. An infill station at East Riverfront and an {{extension}} to Lambert–St. Louis International Airport opened in 1994, followed by a second station at the airport in 1998. Since then, the system has had two major expansions. The first expansion, known as the St. Clair County Extension, was completed on May 5, 2001, with the extension of the Red Line to Belleville, Illinois and two years later <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> Air Force Base. The second major expansion, known as the Cross County Extension, was completed on August 26, 2006, with the addition of the Blue Line branch from Forest Park-DeBaliviere to Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 via Clayton, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Promotion, and {{the extra}} income this would bring, now became a matter of {{considerable}} concern <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, {{he had a chance}} encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery, {{under the auspices of the}} RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E
5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given <b>to</b> <b>Scott.</b> On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} lacked governmental or institutional support, and {{relied on}} private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, Nimrod, {{was less than}} half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott's 1901–04 expedition ship Discovery, and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound, close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise <b>to</b> <b>Scott</b> that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson, carried out extensive geological, zoological and meteorological work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on Manchurian ponies, motor traction, and sled dogs, were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.|$|E
