5|$|A {{decision}} {{holding that}} this action could be maintained {{either by the}} tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes. They are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are conferred upon them by statute.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> purpose of the Act.|$|E

5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. The farmers complained to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> objects of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} democracy of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration {{rests with the}} elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> {{it is for the}} civil servants to carry out this policy.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from <b>the</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>and</b> had not fettered her discretion.|$|E

5|$|The {{new focus}} was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E
