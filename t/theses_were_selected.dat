40|$|This {{study is}} a {{quantitative}} and functional corpus-based study of self-mention in soft science Master theses. One important {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the functions of self-mention in soft science Master theses. For this purpose, 20 soft science Master theses in four disciplines (Applied linguistics, Psychology, Geography, and Political sciences), were randomly selected out of the library of four American universities. Five Master <b>theses</b> <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> in each discipline, in a period of seven years (2007 - 2014). The present study analyzed only  the discussion section of these Master theses. The quantitative analysis of the corpus showed that the frequency of the various forms of self-mention in soft science Master theses is quite different. Among the analyzed resources, “I” with the frequency of 49 was the most frequently used first person pronouns. Based on Tang and John’s (1999) taxonomy of the discourse roles of personal pronouns, self- mentions were functionally analyzed. The findings of the functional dimension of the present study showed that the most frequent discoursal role of self-mentions in the corpus was the recounter of research process, whereas the least frequent role was originator...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{educational}} neuroscience {{has become increasingly}} important {{in the context of}} instruction, and its applications have been transformed into new teaching methods. Although teachers are interested in educational neuroscience, communication between scientists and teachers is not always straightforward. Thus, misunderstandings of neuroscientific research results can evolve into so-called neuromyths. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the prevalence of such music-related neuromyths among music teachers and music students. Based on an extensive literature research, 26 theses were compiled and subsequently evaluated by four experts. Fourteen <b>theses</b> <b>were</b> <b>selected,</b> of which seven were designated as scientifically substantiated and seven as scientifically unsubstantiated (hereafter labeled as “neuromyths”). One group of adult music teachers (n = 91) and one group of music education students (n = 125) evaluated the theses (forced-choice discrimination task) in two separate online surveys. Additionally, in both surveys person-characteristic variables were gathered to determine possible predictors for the discrimination performance. As a result, identification rates of the seven scientifically substantiated theses were similar for teachers (76 %) and students (78 %). Teachers and students correctly rejected 60 and 59 %, respectively, of the seven neuromyths as scientifically unsubstantiated statements. Sensitivity analysis by signal detection theory revealed a discrimination performance of d' = 1. 25 (SD = 1. 12) for the group of teachers and d' = 1. 48 (SD = 1. 22) for the students. Both groups showed a general tendency to evaluate the theses as scientifically substantiated (teachers: c = − 0. 35, students: c = − 0. 41). Specifically, buzz words such as “brain hemisphere” or “cognitive enhancement” were often classified as correct. For the group of teachers, the best predictor of discrimination performance was having read a large number of media about educational neuroscience and related topics (R 2 = 0. 06). For the group of students, the best predictors for discrimination performance were a high number of read media and the hitherto completed number of semesters (R 2 = 0. 14). Our findings make clear that both teachers and students are far from being experts on topics related to educational neuroscience in music and would therefore benefit from current education-related research in psychology and neuroscience...|$|E
40|$|A presente pesquisa procurou examinar o modo como a noção de cultura escolar vem sendo apropriada pelas pesquisas que tomam a escola brasileira como objeto de estudo, especialmente no que se refere às investigações sobre o ensino fundamental. Para isso, realizou-se um levantamento da produção discente dos programas de pós-graduação stricto sensu entre os anos de 1987 e 2007, {{conforme}} registro do Banco de Teses da Capes. Por meio desse balanço, foram selecionados 361 resumos de dissertações e teses que faziam referência ao termo cultura escolar. Em seguida, procedeu-se à elaboração de um instrumento que permitiu o exame de variáveis que puderam expressar as características de tal produção. A análise desses vinte anos de produção indica uma tendência de aumento dos estudos sobre cultura escolar ao longo dos anos, bem como uma concentração dessas pesquisas no eixo Sul-Sudeste do país. Além disso, foi constatada dispersão na orientação das pesquisas, havendo algum esforço de concentração apenas em poucos programas ou em alguns orientadores. Outra constatação refere-se à alta representatividade dos estudos relativos ao ensino fundamental, sobretudo aqueles que tratam de formação de professores, organização escolar por meio de ciclos, gestão escolar, política educacional, currículo e metodologias de ensino. Por fim, é possível concluir que a noção de cultura escolar tem sido significativa para a compreensão do ensino fundamental. This research {{attempted to}} examine the way the notion of school culture has been appropriated by investigations that take the Brazilian schools as their object of study, especially those concerning research on elementary and intermediate schooling. It started with {{a survey of the}} students' production in graduate programs between 1987 and 2007, as found in the Theses Bank of Capes. After that, 361 abstracts from dissertations and <b>theses</b> <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> as they referred the term school culture. Next, an instrument was developed {{to examine the}} variables that could express the characteristics of such production. The analysis of twenty years of academic production indicates a tendency that studies on school culture has been on the rise along the years, as well as a concentration of such investigations in the South-Southeast axis of Brazil. In addition, dispersion was found in the supervision of researches, as there some effort of concentration just in a few programs or a few supervisors. Another finding concerns the high representativeness of studies related to elementary and intermediate schooling, mainly those dealing with teacher education and training, school organization by means of cycles, school management, educational policy, curriculum and teaching methodologies. Finally, one may conclude that the notion of school culture has been meaningful to understand the elementary and intermediate schooling...|$|E
40|$|Esta tese propõe o delineamento da produção de conhecimento sobre ensino de Língua Portuguesa em dissertações de mestrado. Essa proposta de investigação foi construída a partir da pergunta: O ensino de Língua Portuguesa é uma disciplina?. O conceito de disciplina remete-se a Michel Foucault e está formulado no livro, publicado no Brasil, com o título A ordem do Discurso. Desde o tratamento inicial dos dados, verificamos que a resposta a essa pergunta era sim. Essa constatação fundamentou os procedimentos de análise que adotamos. Essa análise decorreu da depreensão de regularidades discursivas quanto aos objetos, às referências teóricas, às proposições e aos métodos de pesquisa validados no discurso científico-acadêmico sobre ensino de Língua Portuguesa. Esse discurso foi analisado em dissertações de mestrado, mapeadas em {{consulta}} ao Banco de Teses da CAPES. Nele, buscamos as dissertações publicadas, no período entre 2001 e 2010, por meio da expressão exata ensino de Língua Portuguesa no campo assunto. Localizamos o total de 321 dissertações, defendidas em Instituições do Ensino Superior de todo o país. A caracterização quantitativa desta produção foi apresentada no capítulo 1. Desse montante de trabalhos identificados na primeira etapa de nossa investigação, delimitamos o nosso corpus em 18 dissertações de mestrado, conforme tratamos no capítulo 2. Nesse capítulo, expusemos os aspectos envolvidos na formação do nosso corpus e abordamos distinções entre coleta de dados e composição do corpus. No terceiro e quarto capítulos, tratamos da configuração do discurso, no que diz respeito aos objetos e métodos de pesquisa recorrentes, ao quadro teórico legitimado e às formulações proposicionais defendidas. Da análise de suas regularidades, verificou-se a negação como componente elementar na constituição do discurso científico-acadêmico sobre ensino de Língua Portuguesa. No capítulo 5, analisamos como esta refutação compareceu em negações polêmicas que contrastam o que foi observado em sala de aula e em materiais didáticos ao quadro teórico referenciado. Por fim, expomos nossas considerações sobre a produção de conhecimento em ensino de Língua Portuguesa, tendo em vista o que tratamos como estabilização da polêmica. This dissertation aims {{to characterize}} the production {{of knowledge about the}} Teaching of Portuguese in Masters theses in Brazil. This research proposal was based on the following research question: Is the Teaching of Portuguese a discipline?. The concept of discipline refers to Michel Foucaults work and it is stated in the book The Discourse on Language, published in Brazil under the title of A Ordem do Discurso. From {{the very beginning of the}} data analysis, we found out that the answer to that question was affirmative. These findings gave us the bases for building the data analysis procedures. On the analysis of the data, we tried to find out discursive regularities with regard to research objects, theoretical frameworks adopted, basic propositions, and research methods validated by the academic and scientific discourse about the Teaching of Portuguese. Such discourse was analyzed on corpora composed by theses available on an academic database kept by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Education. In order to compose the corpora, we selected theses concluded in the period from 2001 to 2010 whose keywords include the expression Teaching of Portuguese. It was possible to identify 321 theses concluded in Brazilian Universities in this period. The quantitative characterization of this academic production is described on Chapter 1. From this total amount, 18 <b>theses</b> <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> to be analyzed as discussed on Chapter 2. Also on this chapter, we discussed some matters regarding the composition of our research corpora and the existing distinction between data gathering and corpora composition. On the Third and Fourth Chapters, we dealt with the configuration of discourse regarding the recurrent topics and methods of research, the theoretical framework legitimized by the authors, and the prepositional formulations defended by them. By analyzing the data, we found out that negation is a basic component on the organization of the scientificacademic discourse about the teaching of Portuguese. On Chapter 5, we analyzed the working of this feature on polemic negations that differs from the observed use of it in the classroom and on textbooks by establishing a contrast between those uses and the theoretical framework adopted by the authors. Lastly, we presented our considerations regarding the production of knowledge in the field of Portuguese Teaching taking into account what we have considered as the stabilization of the controversy...|$|E
