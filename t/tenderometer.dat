40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} pre rigor stretching technology by SmartStretchTM/ SmartShapeTM (4 S) technology on beef tenderness development in M. longissimus dorsi. Twelve steers (approximately two years of age) were selected and slaughtered at the Ruakura abattoir under a standard slaughtering process. Both loins (M. longissimus dorsi) from all animals were randomly allocated into two treatments [stretching (4 S) or control] (left or right) depending upon sides and three ageing times (1, 7 and 14 days of ageing). Assigned stretching loins were stretched with a 4 S machine (Fix-All Services Company Ltd, Hamilton, New Zealand) whereas non-stretched loins (controls) were wrapped in cling polyethylene film. Initial and final lengths of 4 S stretched loins were measured. The entire sampling and treatment process was conducted in approximately around one hour and then all meat loins were transported to a laboratory for storage at - 1. 5 °C. At 24 hours post mortem, {{the length of the}} stretched loins was measured again and all meat loins were cut into three sections in preparation for three different ageing times. The meat sections of 7 and 14 day aged loins were weighed to determine for purge loss measurement prior to vacuum packaging. At the assigned ageing times (1, 7 and 14 days of ageing), each loin was separated into five parts for different measurements including shear force (two <b>tenderometers),</b> sarcomere length, drip loss and biochemistry analysis (proteolysis). The meat loins aged for 7 and 14 days were reweighed to determine purge loss. The results showed that there was on average a 33 % increase in length by 4 S and {{there was no significant difference}} in pH value due to the 4 S treatment. In addition, there was no significant difference for sarcomere length between treatments. Shear force values were not influenced by 4 S (P > 0. 05); however, ageing contributed to an improvement in tenderness (P < 0. 05). Moreover, there was no significant effect of the 4 S treatment on water-holding capacity of loins. A Western blot assay showed that there was no stretching effect on extent of proteolysis of desmin degradation early post mortem; however, with ageing apparent evidence on muscle protein degradation was observed. For a fuller picture of the value of 4 S treatment, the 4 S technology should be applied to a range of beef muscles to attain with different percentage increases in length, types of cattle, either electrical stimulated or not, various pH values, different ageing times and temperatures to explore optimal extent of stretching to achieve maximum meat tenderness...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Peas (Pisum sativum) are an {{important}} constituent in the diet of many people. Peas may be cooked and eaten as green peas shortly after harvest, stored for short periods in the pods, or, after suitable treatment, stored for long periods before consumption. Many factors influence the yield and quality of frozen peas but maturity requires careful consideration because of the relation of maturity to color, flavor, and texture. The objectives of this thesis were {{to determine the effect}} of the maturity stage {{on the quality of the}} frozen peas during processing and storage and to correlate the interactions between the sensory evaluation panel with the physical and chemical quality factors measured. Venus pea variety grown under commercial conditions at the Sublimity area east of Salem, Oregon, were used in this study. The trials were randomized, for three stages of maturity with three replications per each stage of maturity. Each of the three maturity stages was harvested; vined; blanched by steaming at 98. 8 °C (210 °F) for 30 sec for the immature peas, 60 sec for the mature peas, and 90 sec for the overmature peas; frozen at - 37. 2 °C (- 35 °F) for 24 hr in an air blast freezer and stored at - 23. 3 °C (- 10 °F) for 4 and 8 month. During processing and. storage the following factors were determined: <b>tenderometer</b> value, total solids, alcohol insoluble solids, peroxidase activity, ascorbic acid., total sugars and sensory evaluation. In the sensory evaluation analysis starchiness, sweetness and tenderness intensity, as well as texture, flavor and overall desirability were measured. Analysis of variance and least significant difference were used to compare the effect of pea maturity during processing and storage on the different quality factors measured. Correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between these factors. Immature peas had lower <b>tenderometer</b> value than overmature peas. <b>Tenderometer</b> value of peas decreased, during processing. The highest total solids content was observed, in the overmature peas and the lowest total solids content in the immature peas. This behavior was also observed in the alcohol insoluble solids content. Raw peas in the three maturity stages had the same initial peroxidase activity and the significant effect of the maturity level found in the residual peroxidase was affected by the different blanching time applied at each maturity stage. The ascorbic acid content was significantly affected, by the maturity level and was reduced during the blanching treatment. Total soluble sugar content was higher in immature peas and lower in overmature peas. All the sensory evaluation parameters measured were affected by the maturity. In general, the taste panel found higher flavor desirability on the mature peas but when texture and overall desirability were measured immature and mature peas were equally preferred. Significant correlations were found between physical, chemical, and sensory parameters analyzed, some of them are <b>tenderometer</b> value and alcohol insoluble solids; total solids and alcohol insoluble solids; alcohol insoluble solids and overall desirability...|$|E

The space component of the instrument is a sensitive, highly reliable strain gage originally produced for NASA's Surveyor lunar lander and other space programs by BLH Electronics, Waltham, Mass. Several years ago Armour & Co. began to develop a method of testing a hanging carcass to predict how tender the meat would be after cooking; no such method then existed. After considerable experimentation, Armour {{came up with a}} manifold-mounted group of-needle-like probes, which when stuck into a carcass, could measure {{the degree to which the}} meat resisted penetration. This provided a basis for predicting tenderness, but the development required one more. step; a device that could translate meat resistance into an electrical readout. Armour found it in the BLH strain gage. The resulting <b>Tenderometer,</b> now a standard and important part of Armour's meat processing operation, includes a large, 10 -pronged fork which is plunged into a carcass and a cable-connected, handheld electronic device that translates the sensings of the prongs into a tenderness reading on a dial.

40|$|Optimal thermal {{processes}} {{were designed}} for white beans in glass jars heated in a still and end-over-end rotary pilot water cascading retort. For this purpose, isothermal kinetics of thermal softening of white beans were studied in detail using a <b>tenderometer</b> and a texturometer. The fractional conversion model was applied in both cases to model the texture degradation. The Arrhenius equation described well the temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant. With regard to the heat transfer, heat penetration parameters (f(h) and j(h)) were experimentally determined from 100 containers under static as well as rotational (end-over-end) conditions at 4, 7, 10, and 15 rpm. Theoretical optimal temperatures, maximizing volume average quality retention, were calculated using a computer program valid for conduction heating foods. Experimental verification of the calculated results was conducted. Considering the finite surface heat transfer coefficient, theoretical and experimental optimal temperatures were of the same order of magnitude, around 130 degrees C, while for an infinite surface heat transfer coefficient the calculated optimum temperature was {{much lower than the}} experimental value. The type of reaction kinetic model, fractional conversion or first-order models, does not significantly affect optimal sterilization temperatures. Although some differences were found, the developed theoretical approach was successfully applied to convective and mixed heating mode products.

Behavior, growth and carcass traits). Sensory panel evaluations showed that steaks from control and implanted steer carcasses had higher mean scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall palatability than those from control and implanted bulls. Implanting did not influence juiciness or flavor within the bull or steer groups, but control bulls and steers were significantly (P<. 005) more tender and more palatable overall than were implanted bulls and steers. When comparing the mechanical measurements there was considerable variation among the instruments. The Armour <b>tenderometer</b> ranked meat from the implanted steers significantly tougher than either the control or implanted bulls. The Warner-Bratzler shear, Krammer shear and Instron Press ranked steaks from steers significantly more tender than those from bulls. Implanted and control groups of animals were similar in tenderness when judged by the mechanical measurements. Behavior and palatability characteristics of implanted and control bulls and steers were also studied. Implantation made bulls and steers more docile.

40|$|Pea growers {{have much}} at stake in getting high yields of peas of prime quality. The income accruing from a pea crop grown for {{processors}} {{is determined by the}} yield as well as quality. Therefore the farmers 2 ̆ 7 efforts are directed toward growing such a crop. Research workers are interested in knowing the yield of peas with known <b>tenderometer</b> values which will indicate the quality of peas.

A comparison of sampling techniques with present harvesting methods would determine whether or not a sampling technique could be used to obtain the yield and quality evaluation without harvesting the entire plot. Because of errors in vining peas, large plots are required to make evaluation of yields. If a sampling technique would be satis­factory, the field plots could be much reduced in size which would result in a saving in the cost of the trials.

40|$|Four {{vining pea}} (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars 'Tere', 'Piri', 'Pania', and 'Greenfeast 68 ' (Gf. 68) were grown either with {{irrigation}} at start of flowering and pod fill, or without (natural rainfall). Harvesting began once peas reached <b>tenderometer</b> (TR) 90 and continued daily until TR 140 was exceeded. Harvested samples were threshed in a mini-viner, and green pea yield, TR and average sieve size were measured. Subsamples were analysed for alcohol insoluble solids (AIS), total solids (TS) and weight per pea. Botanical characteristics, yield components and total vine yield were also measured. TR was {{highly correlated with}} AIS and {{found to be a}} fast and reliable method for measuring maturity of peas, although the TR-AIS relationship varied between treatments. AIS and TS would be useful methods for measuring maturity when a <b>tenderometer</b> is not available. Irrigation prolonged flowering, delayed harvest, and reduced the rate of TR advance during the first four days of harvest. Irrigation also prolonged the harvest period for all cultivars except Pania. The effect of irrigation treatments on green pea yield was confounded by a period of heavy rain which caused waterlogging and subsequent yield depression in irrigated treatments of Piri, Pania, and Gf. 68. In contrast, the pea yield of the natural rainfall treatments was enhanced by the rainfall. The heavy rain prevented measurement of the differences in the yield response of cultivars to irrigation treatments. Total vine yield, stem length, and number of peas per pod were also adversely affected by waterlogging. Pea yield of Gf. 68 was also reduced by vining difficulties attributed to the pointed pod of this cultivar. Tere, the earliest cultivar, was not adversely affected by the heavy rain. Irrigation enhanced green pea yield of Tere by 20 % due to increases in the number of peas per pod and pods per node. Yield increased with maturation but the rate of increase became smaller with advancing maturity. The curvilinear yield-TR relationship became linear when yield was plotted against log(TR- 75). Differences in yield-TR relationships were measured by comparing regressions of relative yield (yield at TR 105 = 100) against log (TR- 75). The respective relationships for natural rainfall and irrigated treatments of Tere were: Y = 27. 5 + 49. 1 X, and Y = - 21. 7 + 82. 4 X, where Y = relative yield and X = log(TR- 75). The four cultivars did not differ from each other in their yield-TR relationships within each irrigation treatment. The yield-TR relationships of Piri, Pania, and Gf. 68, in contrast to Tere, were unaffected by irrigation, although the period of heavy rain probably influenced these results. The gross return-TR relationship was similar for all cultivar x irrigation treatments, indicating that one payment scale may be equally applicable to newer cultivars as it is to older, less determinate cultivars (e. g. Gf. 68). Gross return was negatively correlated with maturity, and was highest for peas harvested below TR 100. The smallest gross returns for most treatments were for peas at TR 120 to 130. Yield calculated from yield components over-estimated vining pea yield and was found to be unreliable as a method for yield prediction. This was attributed to problems associated with the early growth stage at which the yield components were measured...|$|E

Callipyge displays a complex inheritance pattern of maternal over-dominance and exhibits detrimental effects on meat tenderness. Carwell has been shown to increase eye muscle are by approximately 10 percent, but its effect on tenderness and its mode of inheritance have not been reported. Mode of inheritance for REM was estimated by mating five rams heterozygous for REM to heterozygous ewes to produce 221 progeny comprising four genotypes, namely animals with no copies of the REM QTL, animals with REM inherited either maternally or paternally, and those with REM inherited from both sire and dam. Rib-eye muscle area was increased in animals carrying the REM QTL regardless of the source, when compared to their non-REM contemporaries. The mode of inheritance would appear to be dominant. In a separate experiment, both loins were collected at slaughter from 80 progeny from three sires heterozygous for REM and Romney non-REM ewes.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), previously associated with meat and milk quality traits in cattle, in a population of 443 commercial Aberdeen Angus-cross beef cattle. The eight SNP, which were located within five genes: μ-calpain (CAPN 1), calpastatin (CAST), leptin (LEP), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1), are included in various commercial tests for tenderness, fatness, carcass composition and milk yield/quality. Methods A total of 27 traits were examined, 19 relating to carcass quality, such as carcass weight and fatness, one mechanical measure of tenderness, and the remaining seven were sensory traits, such as flavour and tenderness, assessed by a taste panel. Results An SNP in the CAPN 1 gene, CAPN 316, was significantly associated with tenderness measured by both the <b>tenderometer</b> and the taste panel as well as the weight of the hindquarter, where animals inheriting the CC genotype had more tender meat and heavier hindquarters. An SNP in the leptin gene, UASMS 2, significantly affected overall liking, where animals with the TT genotype were assigned higher scores by the panellists. The SNP in the GHR gene was significantly associated with odour, where animals inheriting the AA genotype produced steaks with an intense odour when compared with the other genotypes. Finally, the SNP in the DGAT 1 gene was associated with sirloin weight after maturation and fat depth surrounding the sirloin, with animals inheriting the AA genotype having heavier sirloins and more fat. Conclusion The results of this study confirm some previously documented associations. Furthermore, novel associations have been identified which, following validation in other populations, could be incorporated into breeding programmes to improve meat quality. </p...|$|E

Meat Science, 85 (4), 684 - 690. Sponsorship: DEFRA; MDC; BBSRC IMPF: 02. 61 RONO: 00 A {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) has been identified on chromosome 18 in Texel sheep (TM-QTL) that increases depth and area of the longissimus dorsi muscle. The study aimed to assess the pleiotropic QTL effects on key meat quality traits (toughness and intramuscular fat content after 7 days aging) of crossbred lambs carrying one copy of the TM-QTL. The results showed that male Texel ? Mule lambs carrying the TM-QTL had significantly less intramuscular fat (1. 86 % versus 2. 25 %) and higher toughness, with increased variation, in the loin muscle, compared to non-carrier males. Similar conclusions were obtained using {{two different types of}} <b>tenderometer</b> equipment: one using the Volodkevitch test (average shear force of 4. 17 kgF or 40. 9 N for carrier males, 2. 61 kgF or 25. 6 N for non-carrier males) and one using the MIRINZ test (average shear force of 6. 18 kgF or 60. 6 N for carrier males, 5. 22 kgF or 51. 2 N for non-carrier males). Although most toughness measurements were within published consumer acceptability limits, a few individual TM-QTL carrier lambs had unacceptably tough meat, despite enhanced post-slaughter processing. The TM-QTL did not significantly affect loin toughness in female lambs, leg toughness in either sex, or intramuscular fat content. These results should be considered, alongside direct effects of the TM-QTL on muscling and carcass composition, in recommendations for the use of this QTL by sheep breeders.

40|$|Muscle {{foods such}} as meat are a perishable, nutritious, {{relatively}} expensive food commodity, {{a great source of}} human nutrition and are {{a large part of the}} New Zealand economy, as well as overseas. Currently, New Zealand’s meat producing companies measure meat quality attributes by using a different technology for every trait, with no overarching way to combine them, with many of the technologies requiring collection and destruction of the product. There is a desire by the meat industry to find a single way to measure and compare meat quality parameters in a single process or technology. The development of an in-line (within the normal production line of an abattoir or meat processor), real time, non-destructive quality control system could help define multiple meat traits in a way that can guarantee the product in terms of composition, safety and consistency. These guarantees not only help the producer to ask a higher premium for their product, but also give assurances to the consumer that they are getting exactly what they are expecting and paying for. This thesis focussed on determining whether the spectral imaging technologies of near infrared and hyperspectral imaging, and relevant pre-processing and modelling techniques were suitable for use in an in-plant situation for the prediction of lamb meat quality attributes. Data was collected on 2511 lambs from 10 separate kills. The lambs were slaughtered through three abattoirs owned by Alliance Group Limited with near infrared and hyperspectral imaging of intact M. Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle surface collected at 24 hours post-mortem. Traditional meat quality measurements were also collected; tenderness using a MIRINZ <b>tenderometer,</b> CIELab colour using a CR- 400 colour meter, ultimate pH using an Eutech Cyberscan pH 300 meter, marbling using subjective scoring by trained personnel and intramuscular fat content using gas chromatography – flame ionisation detector. The resulting data were split and used to generate calibration and validation data sets. The calibration data was used together with the spectral data that was processed using a variety of chemometric techniques including partial least squares, variable selection and neural networks to generate predictive models. The accuracy of the predictive models was then tested using the validation data set. 6 This work found that not all meat quality traits were able to be predicted accurately and certain techniques worked better for differing traits. The best predictive models for ultimate pH using the near infrared and hyperspectral data achieved R 2 values (a measure of goodness of fit) from the validation data sets of 0. 63 and 0. 48 respectively. For near infrared the best predictive models were achieved using partial least squares with pre-processing (standard normal variate, orthogonal signal correction and mean centring) applied, while for hyperspectral imaging neural networks provided the best model using a decay of 0. 00004 and a node size of 2. The best predictive models for intramuscular fat using the near infrared and hyperspectral data achieved R 2 values from the validation data sets of 0. 56 and 0. 75 respectively. For near infrared this was achieved using partial least squares with pre-processing (normalisation, multiplicative scatter correction and mean centring) applied, while for hyperspectral imaging neural networks provided the best model using a decay of 0. 0009 and a node size of 4. This performance of these two traits in particular, shows that that the prediction abilities are of a quality that future work on implementing these into an in-line system at a pilot scale should be considered. Overall, the use of novel modelling techniques such as neural networks showed potential to increase the predictive abilities of the resulting models, over more traditional modelling techniques. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the number of predictors needed to create a calibration model could be reduced, increasing the speed of analysis with only minimal loss in the accuracy of the resulting model. Results obtained during this study suggest that the calibration models are not abattoir dependent and the transfer of one calibration model to multiple abattoirs could decrease the costs and allow for faster development and implementation of an in-line, in-plant system...|$|E
