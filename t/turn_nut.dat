50|$|In most {{pendulum}} clocks {{the rate}} is adjusted by moving the bob up or down on the pendulum rod.

50|$|The {{procedure}} {{consists of}} an initial surgery, during which the bone is surgically fractured and the ring apparatus is attached. As the patient recovers, the fractured bone begins to grow together. While the bone is growing, the frame is adjusted by means of <b>turning</b> the <b>nuts,</b> thus increasing the space between two rings. As the rings are connected to {{opposite sides of the}} fracture, this adjustment, done four times a day, moves the now-healing fracture apart by approximately one millimeter per day. The incremental daily increases result in a considerable lengthening of the limb over time. Once the lengthening phase is complete, the apparatus stays on the limb for a consolidation period. The patient is able to fully weight bear on the Ilizarov frame, using crutches initially and pain is lessened. Once healing is complete, a second surgery is necessary to remove the ring apparatus. The result is a limb that is significantly longer. Additional surgery may be necessary, in the case of leg lengthening, to lengthen the Achilles tendon to accommodate the longer bone length. The major advantage of this procedure is that because the apparatus provides complete support while the bone is recovering the patient can remain active aiding recovery.|$|R

50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the bottle jack works by <b>turning</b> a large <b>nut</b> running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a square socket.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{provides}} {{theoretical research}} of load distribution across the thread turns of the planetary roller-screw mechanism (RSM). A characteristic {{feature of the}} theoretical approach of {{the paper is the}} use of a RSM rod model with two elastic contact layers (the first layer is composed of screw-rollers, the second – of nut-rollers). A threaded mating of each elastic layer is considered as a connection with continuous turns, which is closest to the truth and consistent to classical approaches. A similar approach was applied for the ball-and-screw mechanisms with a member point contact. Thus, differential analytical closed-form equations may be used to solve this task. Based on the initial equation of compatibility of strains, axial offsets of contact layer points and the sum of screw, roller and <b>nut</b> <b>turn</b> deflections are calculated; then, load distribution across the turns may be determined. Load distribution depends both on the RSM geometry (pitch, profile angle, entry number, and thread diameter), material of threaded elements, manufacturing accuracy, and on mating friction forces. With the dependencies of load distribution across the turns of zero-clearance RSMs obtained, we have determined that maximum load is imposed on the outermost turns, which corresponds to classical solutions proposed by N.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the results of}} recent tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These tests address {{the effectiveness of the}} lubricant used on the threaded portion of the valve stem, where the stem <b>nut</b> <b>turns</b> on the stem. Recent testing indicates that an elevated temperature environment can lead to significant increases in the friction coefficient at the stem/stem-nut interface. Most valve actuator qualification tests are performed at room temperature. Similarly, in-service tests are run at ambient plant temperatures, usually 70 to 100 0;F. Since design conditions can lead to valve operating temperatures in the 200 to 300 0;F range, {{it is important to know}} whether a temperature-induced increase in friction at the stem/stem-nut interface will prevent the required operation of critical valves. Lubricant aging is another phenomenon that might have deleterious effects on the thrust output of a valve actuator. Laboratory experience and field experience both indicate that after long periods in elevated temperature environments, the lubricants may lose their lubrication qualities. The scope of the current test program includes testing of five different lubricants on four different valve stems. Pending completion of the testing, results of the tests conducted using two of the four stems are discussed. The test series included collection of baseline data at room temperature, single step temperature tests where the temperature of the test setup was elevated directly to 250 °F, and step testing where the temperature was elevated in steps to 130, 190, and 250 °F, then returned to 70 °F. All greases tested showed evidence of physical change after elevated temperature tests. Except for one particular lubricant, all of the greases tested showed increased coefficients of friction at elevated temperatures. Numerous other preliminary conclusions are presented. Recommendations for future research in the area of aged valve stem lubricant performance at elevated temperatures are also presented...|$|R
