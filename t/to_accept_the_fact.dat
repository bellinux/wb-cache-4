In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqué announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.|$|E
5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.|$|E

25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E

25|$|Though Catherine's {{life and}} reign {{included}} remarkable personal successes, they ended with two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was {{given at the}} imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement {{was supposed to be}} announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Alexandra would not be converting to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. Catherine was so irritated at this, her health was affected. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony where a favourite grandson would supersede her difficult son on the throne, but she died of a stroke before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball.|$|E

This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) {{at that time and}} uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly struck me about her argument was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal {{to come to terms with}} its past.' ...|$|E

500|$|Fun Home {{has several}} themes {{recurring}} throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells {{the readers of}} her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. [...] "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about {{in a manner consistent}} with my bookish upbringing." [...] Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped her come to terms with her sexuality, but in truth, the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire [...] "for the right to exchange [...] tank suit for a pair of shorts" [...] in Cannes" [...] or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. [...] However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a different way than Alison. [...] "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" [...] when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to [...] "gay union" [...] meetings when she was a student at Oberlin College. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it. [...] This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it is clear that he is afraid of coming out, as illustrated by [...] "the fear in his eyes" [...] when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the novel's success, the {{adjective}} [...] "Pollyannaish" [...] and the noun [...] "Pollyannaism" [...] became popular terms for a personality type characterised by irrepressible optimism evident in the face of even the most adverse or discouraging of circumstances. It is sometimes used pejoratively, referring to someone whose optimism is excessive to the point of naïveté or refusing <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of an unfortunate situation. This pejorative use can be heard in the introduction of the 1930 George and Ira Gershwin song [...] "But Not For Me": [...] "I never want to hear from any cheerful pollyannas/who tell me fate supplies a mate/that's all bananas." [...] (performed by Judy Garland in the 1943 movie Girl Crazy) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} commentary {{appeared in}} the right-wing newspaper Universul just after the strike: [...] "The troops only did their duty. The fault does not lie with them. They fired.

Later, the chief military and civilian figures responsible for the shooting were removed from their positions as the press came <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the strike dealt with poor conditions and was not a communist-led anti-regime action. As early as 9 August, the left-leaning Adevărul wrote: [...] "What happened at Lupeni is a warning for our leaders, who for ten years have divided the country and ruined her economically, everywhere spreading misery, the mother of desperate mass actions".|$|E

The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the message to governments: [...] "We are no longer willing <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger." [...] Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{one-tenth of}} USIA assets were, indeed, German. Others were {{historically}} Austrian properties, expropriated with ludicrous explanations or with no explanations at all. Expropriation of {{lands of the}} House of Esterházy was [...] "justified" [...] because, according to the Soviets, the knighthood of the Holy Roman Empire conferred in 1806 qualified Esterházy as Germans rather than Austrians.

The Soviets used this refusal as a pretext for not paying Austrian taxes. Exact number of businesses under USIA control is subject to different interpretations. According to Austrian 1955 sources, there were 419 enterprises, of them 300 in the industry. A different source named 160 enterprises in 1954 (excluding the oil fields, transportation companies and trading outlets). The Soviets also operated Soviet Military Bank (SMB) which evolved from the Red Army field treasury.

500|$|Disraeli {{was born}} on 21 December 1804 at 6 King's Road, Bedford Row, Bloomsbury, London, the second child and eldest son of Isaac D'Israeli, a {{literary}} critic and historian, and Maria (Miriam), née Basevi. The family was of Sephardic Jewish Italian mercantile background. All Disraeli's grandparents and great-grandparents were born in Italy; Isaac's father, Benjamin, moved to England from Venice in 1748. Disraeli later romanticised his origins, claiming that his father's family was of grand Spanish and Venetian descent; in fact Isaac's family was of no great distinction, but on Disraeli's mother's side, in which he took no interest, there were some distinguished forebears. Historians differ on Disraeli's motives for rewriting his family history: Bernard Glassman argues that {{it was intended to}} give him status comparable to that of England's ruling elite; Sarah Bradford believes [...] "his dislike of the commonplace would not allow him <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of his birth as being as middle-class and undramatic as they really were".|$|R
40|$|Being {{diagnosed}} with a chronic illness such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) can have a considerable psychological impact on a person’s life. However, this has been little explored and therefore {{it is unclear what}} support may be most beneficial at this time. This study therefore explored personal experiences of being {{diagnosed with}} PD. Six participants were interviewed and data analysed using thematic analysis. Three over-arching themes emerged: 1) “Understanding it is an important thing” – The value of knowledge; 2) "You’ve got to get used <b>to</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that you need help" - The social implications of being diagnosed with PD; and 3) "I think you need to talk to somebody" - The importance of supportive others. The process of diagnosis was complex and often challenging for participants, with respect to their own understanding and that of others. Recommendations for future practice within specialist PD services are made, to improve the support that is offered at this time...|$|R
