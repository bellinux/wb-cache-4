5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
25|$|On {{their return}} from Rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed {{by his son}} Æthelbald. With civil war looming the magnates of the realm met in council <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. {{historical}} Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred.|$|E
25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly {{with a small group}} of strike leaders <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not feel compelled to recognize the union. But the administration did rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E

However, she manages to abandon the experts' step-by-step instructions, creating an incomplete bench that was nowhere near level or in one piece.|$|R
25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E
25|$|They {{applied for}} a federal charter for the {{foundation}} in the US Senate in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President William Howard Taft, through the aegis of Senator Nelson Aldrich, <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> concessions. However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.|$|E
25|$|Following {{approval}} of the RAIC program by the convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, Hillman returned to Soviet Russia {{in the summer of}} 1922 <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> additional details of the enterprise. Contracts were negotiated with the chief economic planning organizations of the day, including an agreement with the Council of Labor and Defense (STO) authorizing RAIC to do business with various Soviet agencies and another with the Supreme Council for National Economy (Vesenkha) insuring the RAIC's contracts and pledging a dividend of 8% on invested funds if either the Soviets or the Americans sought to terminate the company after a three-year trial period.|$|E

50|$|Peace {{talks between}} Sudan and Darfur rebels were {{scheduled}} to resume on 21 October in Abuja, Nigeria. However, rebels showed up late and the talks did not begin until 25 October. Two more rebel groups now want in on the negotiations, and an existing cease-fire agreement is considered shaky. The talks are still in progress, but a humanitarian agreement is expected <b>to</b> be <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> {{during the course of}} the talks.|$|R
50|$|The ongoing global {{financial}} crisis {{was identified as}} a threat to the goals envisioned by the charter. The most controversial part of the charter was the proposed human rights body, details of which were <b>to</b> be <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> at the summit in February 2009. The body would not have the power to impose sanctions or punish countries that violate citizens' rights and would therefore be limited in effectiveness.|$|R
25|$|In early July it {{appeared}} that he had jinxed both their chances with Heath behind in the polls in the General Election and Kent {{at the bottom of}} the championship table. The change came when Sussex defeated them in the Gillette Cup, giving them two rest days which Cowdrey used <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> their difficulties in a team meeting. They decided to chase bonus points and won 7 and drew 5 of their last 12 games, often by close margins and it was a draw at the Oval, where Cowdrey made 112, that gave them the title with the newly elected Prime Minister Heath at the ground to invite them to a reception at Number 10 to celebrate.|$|E
25|$|In the {{political}} life of Spain, the king {{would already be}} familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a General Election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, {{the political}} leaders would customarily have met beforehand <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a coalition agreements before their meeting with the king. Once appointed, the President of the Government forms an administration whose ministers are appointed and removed by the king on the president's advice. No minister may take up his appointment until after they give their oath of office to obey the constitution with loyalty to the king.|$|E
25|$|After {{blowing the}} tire on turn one, Mulford had to limp {{around the track}} for almost an entire lap, and {{subsequently}} bent the rim. That necessitated an even longer pit stop at that juncture <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> the damage. The accounts from the newspapers claim that Harroun changed only four tires all day during only three pit stops. Harroun's team changed the right rear tire three times, and one other unspecified tire. Harroun's shorter elapsed time in the pits is alone considered sufficient to more than overcome any track position advantage Mulford might have been thought to have. But the undermining evidence to support Harroun as the rightful winner was the team strategy to run a constant 75mph pace, regardless of position, {{in order to save}} tire wear. During the 1910 Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race, as well as during test runs in May 1911, Harroun discovered that by merely running a constant 75 mph pace instead of an 80 mph (or faster) pace, he would substantially reduce his tire wear and increase tire life.|$|E

50|$|In 1816, the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, {{which had}} earlier {{successfully}} adapted {{new technology to}} shipbuilding with the Charlotte Dundas, authorised {{the development of an}} all-iron ship, and they quickly settled upon building a canal barge. In 1818, Thomas Wilson (1781-1873), was hired as the shipwright. The barge was to be 20 metres (66.5 ft.) long and narrow enough for the canal. The design called for iron sectionals to be riveted together with covering plates. Two blacksmiths were hired to construct the parts. The plating had <b>to</b> be <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> of puddled iron as no iron rolling mills existed at the time. The iron was supplied by the Monklands Steel Company.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1998, Saturn began feuding with Glacier after Saturn's {{usage of}} the Super Kick {{offended}} Glacier, who deemed it a plagiarism of his Cryonic Kick finisher. Later in the year, Saturn was defeated by fellow Flock member Van Hammer in a [...] "Loser Leaves The Flock" [...] match. However, Raven opted <b>to</b> throw <b>Hammer</b> <b>out</b> of the Flock instead. Problems began to arise between Raven and Saturn, and the latter eventually left The Flock, turning face by {{standing up to the}} domineering Raven. Raven held all the other Flock members in thrall, so Saturn challenged him to match for the September 13 Fall Brawl pay-per-view. If Saturn won, The Flock would be freed, but if Raven won, Saturn would become his slave.|$|R
500|$|The auto trail {{associations}} {{rejected the}} elimination of the highway names. [...] Six regional meetings were held <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> the details—May 15 for the West, May 27 for the Mississippi Valley, June 3 for the Great Lakes, June 8 for the South, June 15 for the North Atlantic, and June 15 for New England. [...] Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings. [...] However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included. [...] The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the war, November 1914, Benedict negotiated with the warring parties about an exchange of wounded and other prisoners of war who were unable to continue fighting. Tens of thousands of such prisoners were exchanged through the intervention of Benedict XV. On 15 January 1915, the Pope proposed an exchange of civilians from the occupied zones, which resulted in 20,000 persons being sent to unoccupied Southern France in one month. In 1916, the Pope managed <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> an agreement between both sides, by which 29,000 prisoners with lung disease from the gas attacks could be sent into Switzerland. In May 1918, he also reached agreement that prisoners on both sides with at least 18 months of captivity and four children at home would also be sent to neutral Switzerland.|$|E

[...] Stylus Magazine stated [...] "Despite the fact that Dre {{had nothing to do}} with this project, the album sounds just as big-budget and lavishly appointed as The Documentary. Like his mentor, Game knows how to tweak the bone-rattling clap of the snare and play up the percussive aspect of keyboards." ...|$|E

When {{the plane was}} completely level, Tucker reported to Memphis Center, informed them about the attack and requested a vector back to Memphis.

50|$|Pitt {{selected}} William Eden {{because of}} {{his work on the}} board of Trade and Plantations, and because Eden had vast experience dealing with economic grievances in both Ireland and America, which Pitt believed would furnish Eden with exceptional insight into the Anglo-Franco deliberations. Eden went <b>to</b> work immediately, <b>hammering</b> <b>out</b> an agreement with Gérard de Rayneval, his French counterpart, in April 1786. But, in spite of Eden’s optimism, the British, and more specifically Pitt, did not favor Eden and Rayneval’s original agreement because of its vagueness. Pitt sought to enforce higher duties on what he deemed as the most important goods entering the Anglo-Franco trade market.|$|R

2500|$|Rapso {{has become}} the most {{influential}} of these two main descendants of calypso; it arose as Black Power and Pan-Africanist thought spread in Trinidad. Lancelot Layne is said to have invented the genre with his 1971 hit [...] "Blow Away", while Cheryl Byron brought rapso to calypso tents in 1976. The term rapso first appeared in 1980 on Busting Out, an album by Brother Resistance and his Network Riddum Band. Rapso {{has become one of the}} most prevalent expressions of music on Trinidad itself, but is largely absorbed into calypso during Carnival celebrations and contests. [...] The 1990s saw a more politically and spiritually-conscious form of rapso, which has been infused with soul and reggae music, as well as native J'ouvert, an early introduction to Carnival which consists of percussionists using makeshift materials <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a beat. The trio band 3canal, and the artist Ataklan, are among the most popular modern proponents.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later Tito arrived and Maclean had to convey Churchill's displeasure at his sudden and unexplained departure. [...] Tito had been to Moscow at Stalin's invitation, to arrange matters with the Soviet High Command. [...] Maclean helped <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a draft agreement, and went to London with it, while Tito's envoys took it to Moscow. [...] "It was a {{difficult}} and thankless task. King Peter, quite naturally, {{was not easy to}} reassure, and Tito, sitting in Belgrade with all the cards in his hand, was not easy to satisfy." [...] The bargaining went on for months, and meanwhile Maclean's staff wanted to get away, to assist guerrilla wars elsewhere. [...] When the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin) met at Yalta in February 1945, and made it clear that Tito and Šubašić had to get on with it, King Peter gave in, and all the pieces fell into place. The regents were sworn in, as was the united government, and the British ambassador flew in. [...] Maclean was finally able to leave.|$|E
2500|$|After the decision, the Harbour Commission {{notified}} the Government of Canada {{that it could}} not continue to run the airport and asked that the Government of Canada take it over. However, the government chose to offer the airport to local interests for 90 days. If no local interest came forward, the Harbour Commission could begin to shut down the airport. The Harbour Commission cited the lack of fixed link, the ban on jets and the potential long response time to a major disaster at the airport. Tonks suggested the Greater Toronto Airports Authority agency running Pearson airport should take over the island airport as well. In September mayor Hall changed her position on the airport. Hall proposed continuing the jet ban but allow the bridge and allow modifications to the noise guidelines to allow U.S. regional airline turboprop planes to land at the airport. A few days later Hall met with federal Transport Minister Doug Young, provincial Transportation Minister Al Palladini, provincial Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach, Tonks and the Harbour Commissioners <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a deal. Jets were ruled out as, in Young's words, [...] "city councillors appear solidly opposed".|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the European Community (EC) has been torn between its natural mandate as an {{institution}} set up to promote free movement of goods and production factors, and the strong pressures for protection resulting from the recession and from the sharp difficulties experienced {{by a number of}} industries. Through agreeing to the Tokyo Round pack-age, the EC committed itself to participate in a unprecedentedly wide ranging package of multilateral trade liberalization, the precise signif-icance of which still remains <b>to</b> be <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> in the GATT commit-tees which will implement the newly agreed to codes of behavior. The Lome agreement has been renegotiated, and the Generalized Scheme of Preferences will be renewed soon. Both are basically bilateral agree-ments concluded before the recession. On the other hand, there have been sharp turns of the protection screw for textiles and clothing and for steel especially, whereas the EC has found itself involved in trying to moderate a subsidy war in shipbuilding...|$|R

2500|$|The Tet Offensive {{increased}} public {{discontent with}} American {{participation in the}} Vietnam War and led the U.S. to gradually withdraw combat forces and to shift responsibility to the South Vietnamese, a process called Vietnamization. Pushed into Cambodia, the Việt Cộng could no longer draw South Vietnamese recruits. In May 1968, Trường Chinh urged [...] "protracted war" [...] in a speech that was published prominently in the official media, so the fortunes of his [...] "North first" [...] fraction may have revived at this time. COSVN rejected this view as [...] "lacking resolution and absolute determination." [...] The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 led to intense Sino-Soviet tension and to the withdrawal of Chinese forces from North Vietnam. Beginning in February 1970, Lê Duẩn's prominence in the official media increased, suggesting that he was again top leader and had regained {{the upper hand in}} his longstanding rivalry with Trường Chinh. After the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk in March 1970, the Việt Cộng faced a hostile Cambodian government which authorized a U.S. offensive against its bases in April. However, the capture of the Plain of Jars and other territory in Laos, as well as five provinces in northeastern Cambodia, allowed the North Vietnamese to reopen the Ho Chi Minh trail. Although 1970 was a much better year for the Việt Cộng than 1969, it would never again be more than an adjunct to the PAVN. The 1972 Easter Offensive was a direct North Vietnamese attack across the DMZ between North and South. Despite the Paris Peace Accords, signed by all parties in January 1973, fighting continued. In March, Trà was recalled to Hanoi for a series of meetings <b>to</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>out</b> a plan for an enormous offense against Saigon.|$|E
