5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added <b>to</b> <b>table</b> salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce {{tend to have a}} high sodium content and fill a similar role <b>to</b> <b>table</b> salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous <b>to</b> <b>table</b> salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine <b>to</b> <b>table</b> salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar <b>to</b> <b>table</b> salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E

5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected <b>to</b> <b>table</b> a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

The movement proceeds exactly as in a straight Mitchell, when East-West pairs arrive at table 9 they simply do not play that round.|$|R
