40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfillment for {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Master of Commerce (MCOM) at Strathmore UniversityThe presence of security market anomalies provide an opportunity that market participants can exploit. Studies done in Kenya have identified <b>the</b> presence of <b>holiday</b> anomaly. Based on these studies, the first objective of the study sought to establish the effect of each of <b>the</b> eight Kenyan <b>holidays</b> to <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly. <b>The</b> study used closing share prices which were derived from the NSE website for the period 2010 - 2015. From {{the results of the}} test carried out, the study established that <b>the</b> eight different <b>holidays</b> affected <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly differently. <b>The</b> state <b>holidays</b> exhibited higher return than <b>the</b> religious <b>holidays.</b> <b>The</b> study also sought to establish which sectors in the NSE were more prone to <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly. A test of equality of mean was carried out to determine whether the mean returns for the different sectors during <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> were significantly different. The findings of the test conducted indicated that there was no single sector that was more prone to <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly than <b>the</b> other. In addition, the study sought to investigate the perception of the trading market participants in regard to market anomaly and specifically to <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly. This information was derived from the trading market participants using questionnaires. The findings from the analysis established that majority of the trading market participants had knowledge of security market anomalies though only a few had knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly. Those who had knowledge of security market anomalies had designed trading strategies that enabled them to earn superior returns. The results of the study contradict the efficient market hypothesis since study has established <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly is present. The result of the study also indicate that the eight different Kenyan <b>holidays</b> affect <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly differently. <b>The</b> results further indicate that there is no sector in the NSE that is more prone to <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> anomaly than <b>the</b> other...|$|R

5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, {{particularly on the}} islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) {{along the coast of}} the Baltic, communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe <b>the</b> <b>holidays</b> of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before <b>the</b> <b>holidays,</b> followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
