[...] Both major parties have made strong commitments in support of Israel.

[...] Uslander goes on to point out that negative views of Evangelical Christians had a distinctly negative impact for Republicans among Jewish voters, while Orthodox Jews, traditionally more conservative in outlook as to social issues, favored the Republican Party. A New York Times article suggests that the Jewish movement to the Republican party is focused heavily on faith-based issues, similar to the Catholic vote, which is credited for helping President Bush taking Florida in 2004. However, Natan Guttman, The Forward’s Washington bureau chief, dismisses this notion, writing in Moment that while [...] "t is true <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> making small and steady strides into the Jewish community…a look at the past three decades of exit polls, which are more reliable than pre-election polls, and the numbers are clear: Jews vote overwhelmingly Democratic," [...] an assertion confirmed by the most recent presidential election results.|$|E

5000|$|In {{some ways}} the ward has been a {{microcosm}} of the Northern Ireland troubles. The June 1970 [...] "Battle of Saint Matthew's" [...] occupies an important place in Irish republican history after a gun battle between republicans and loyalists, who were accused of attacking the church. Loyalists counter this with claims that three Orange Order members were killed after returning from a parade. It is seen as one of the key developments in the rise to prominence of the Provisional IRA. Similarly on the Ballymacarrett side of the peaceline, Protestant residents have claimed <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> engaged in attacks on Protestant homes which amount to 'ethnic cleansing' - claims which Republicans dispute and deny.|$|E
50|$|Although {{all major}} {{political}} demographics support voter ID laws, a 2013 study showed significant divergence in opinion between conservative-affiliated demographics, which are staunch supporters, and liberal-affiliated demographics, which are less supportive. The study {{also showed that}} support depends on survey framing: when questions biased against voter ID laws are asked, support drops 15% compared to when questions favorable to voter ID laws are asked. A 2016 study showed that emphasizing the adverse effects of voter ID laws on eligible voters decreased popular support for such laws. Another 2016 study found that white people {{with high levels of}} implicit racism, but not explicit racism, were more supportive of voter ID laws when they were exposed to a fear-eliciting condition. A 2016 study found that partisan affiliation is a major determinant of support for voter ID laws and <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> especially likely to be concerned about voter fraud. Research shows that Individuals who hold anti-immigrant views are most likely to believe that voter fraud is rampant.|$|E
5000|$|Tax {{expenditures}} are considered [...] "off-budget" [...] spending by most economists and budget experts. Tax {{expenditures are}} easier to pass through Congress than increases in appropriations spending. They are easily seen as free benefits, when government grants are viewed as giveaways. Unlike direct spending, tax spending must only pass through two committees, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance. Tax expenditure programs, once in the tax code, do not come up for annual review and can only be removed through tax legislation. Tax expenditure programs are a form of entitlement spending in that every tax payer that qualifies can claim government money. Faricy (2011) demonstrated that when tax expenditures are counted {{as a type of}} government spending, Democratic and Republican parties are indistinguishable in annual changes to federal government spending. This study also finds <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> more likely to increase tax expenditures when in control of government thereby subsidizing the activities of businesses and the wealthy. Jacob Hacker (2002) shows that the federal subsidization of private health insurance has grown over the years and has made efforts for nationalized health care more difficult. Ellis and Faricy (2011) find that when tax expenditures rise, public opinion adjusts and becomes more liberal to counteract the conservative policies.|$|E

5000|$|Politics {{are more}} likely to inspire {{selective}} exposure among consumers as opposed to single exposure decisions. For example, in their 2009 meta-analysis of Selective Exposure Theory, Hart et al. reported that [...] "A 2004 survey by The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press (2006) found <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> about 1.5 times more likely to report watching Fox News regularly than are Democrats (34% for Republicans and 20% of Democrats). In contrast, Democrats are 1.5 times more likely to report watching CNN regularly than Republicans (28% of Democrats vs. 19% of Republicans). Even more striking, Republicans are approximately five times more likely than Democrats to report watching [...] "The O'Reilly Factor" [...] regularly and are seven times more likely to report listening to [...] "Rush Limbaugh" [...] regularly." [...] As a result, when the opinions of Republicans who only tune into conservative media outlets were compared to those of their fellow conservatives in a study by Stroud (2010), their beliefs were considered to be more polarized. The same result was retrieved from the study of liberals as well. Due to our greater tendency toward selective exposure, current political campaigns have been characterized as being extremely partisan and polarized. As Bennett and Iyengar (2008) commented, [...] "The new, more diversified information environment makes it not only more feasible for consumers to seek out news they might find agreeable but also provides a strong economic incentive for news organizations to cater to their viewers' political preferences." [...] Selective exposure thus plays a role in shaping and reinforcing individuals' political attitudes. In early research, selective exposure originally provided an explanation for limited media effects. The [...] "limited effects" [...] model of communication emerged in the 1940s with a shift in the media effects paradigm. This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of opinion leaders. Selective exposure was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media's limited power over citizens' attitudes and behaviors. Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people {{are more likely}} to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization. This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al. (2010)'s study on blog readership that people tend to read blogs that reinforce rather than challenge their political beliefs. According to Cass Sunstein's book, Republic.com, the presence of selective exposure on the web creates an environment that breeds political polarization and extremism. Due to easy access to social media and other online resources, people are [...] " [...] likely to hold even stronger views than the ones they started with, and when these views are problematic, they are likely to manifest increasing hatred toward those espousing contrary beliefs." [...] This illustrates how selective exposure can influence an individual's political beliefs and subsequently his participation in the political system.|$|E

The authors test this hypothesis using aggregate-level data from state legislative races in nonpartisan Nebraska and partisan Kansas, mayoral races in nonpartisan Phoenix and partisan Tucson, and California statewide races including the nonpartisan contest for superintendent of public instruction. Findings indicate that nonpartisan elec-tions have partisan consequences but that the effect is in favor of the minority party rather than the Republican Party...|$|E

50|$|Corker's {{opponent}} in the election <b>was</b> a black <b>Republican</b> named Thomas Payce Beard.

I argue that the notion of non-domination as it is formulated by Pettit contains a number of ambiguities that need to be addressed. I discuss these ambiguities and argue for specific solutions that place great importance on a person's moral beliefs and his status as a moral being amongst others. Furthermore, I argue that the impunity interpretation is to be favoured over the immunity interpretation of non-domination. I show that whilst these solutions accord well with many important republican tenets, they have other implications that contradict known republican positions. In particular, I show there is both room and a need for retributivism within republicanism...|$|E

The findings strongly support the hypothesis that outside career behavior {{is a function of the}} financial opportunity costs of legislative service. In addition, I find <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> more likely to hold outside careers than Democrats.

40|$|This article {{builds on}} {{previous}} research with {{an analysis of}} partisan differ-ences {{in the emergence of}} politically experienced candidates in open seat House races from 1976 to 1994. Consistent with previous research, we find that local partisan forces-the normal vote in the district and the party hold-ing the seat-are the most important determinants of whether experienced candidates emerge in open seat races. But we find <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> more sensitive to local partisan forces than Democrats, indicating that experienced Republicans run mainly in districts favorable to Republicans, whereas Demo-crats run for open seats in a wider range of districts. And contrary to previous research, we discover that a national condition-presidential popularity-is significantly related to the emergence of experienced Republicans in open seats. These results reveal that we need to look for different relationships across the parties. Because we suspected that the relationships might have changed in recent elections, we compared relationships in 1976 - 90 and 1992 - 94. This analysis indicates that the relationships found in previous elections may have changed. In 1992 - 94, the emergence of experienced Democrat...|$|E
40|$|The Northern Ireland {{story is}} more complex than the trite tale of orange versus green or two warring tribes. Current {{inhabitants}} are not settling ancient scores. Northern Ireland is the product of colonialism, the plantation of Ulster, machinations of a British state determined to retain a strategic outpost, 50 years of one party discriminatory government and the recent conflict. The Good Friday Agreement facilitated an end to armed conflict but is inherently flawed. Compounding the Stormont Assembly’s very limited ability to steer the economy is reluctance by the political parties to accept the rationale of the Agreement. Republicans are unhappy that Northern Ireland will remain British while unionists dislike the fact <b>that</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>are</b> partners in administration.
