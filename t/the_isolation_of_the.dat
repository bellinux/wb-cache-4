5|$|As both {{scientists}} discovered thallium {{independently and}} {{a large part of}} the work, especially <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: For the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: thallium, for the discovery of the new element. The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E

5|$|In the end, {{air superiority}} and {{command of the}} sea allowed the Allies to heavily {{reinforce}} their position on Los Negros. The 1st Cavalry Division could then overrun the islands.

5|$|Polacanthids {{are known}} from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The {{timing of the}} {{appearance}} of nodosaurids on both continents indicates {{the origins of the}} clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae {{by the end of the}} Aptian provides a revised date for <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continents from each other with rising sealevel.|$|E
5|$|Since Raja Sahil Varman, the dynasty ruled without {{successful}} invasion {{for around}} a millennium, until the British gained power. <b>The</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town and its rugged hilly terrain {{is believed to}} have been a contributing factor to this unusual state of security. Later, Mughal emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb did attempt to annex Chamba but were unsuccessful in subjugating this territory into their kingdoms. Raja Prithvi Singh (1641-1664 AD), who was on amiable terms with Emperor Shahjahan was instrumental in introducing the court lifestyles of the Mughals.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{island and}} its {{diversity}} of habitats and microclimates have favoured the diversification {{of a highly}} endemic flora: Of the 850 known native plant species, 230 are endemic, and half of those are endangered. This native flora is found at various altitudes. Nearly as many exotic plants as native ones, 830, have become naturalised on the island, and 50 are considered invasive, threatening native flora and habitats.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farms and villages. Denonville {{was quoted as saying}} “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but a miracle of God,”.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{show that}} when {{termites}} encounter {{each other in}} foraging areas, some of the termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering. Dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area and thus the need to construct new tunnels. Conflict between two competitors does not always occur. For example, though they might block each other's passages, colonies of Macrotermes bellicosus and Macrotermes subhyalinus are not always aggressive towards each other. Suicide cramming is known in Coptotermes formosanus. Since C.formosanus colonies may get into physical conflict, some termites squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die, successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
