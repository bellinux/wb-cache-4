5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance.

The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|H.non-scripta {{differs from}} H.hispanica, which occurs as an {{introduced}} {{species in the}} British Isles, {{in a number of}} ways. H.hispanica has paler flowers which are borne in radially symmetrical racemes; their tepals are less recurved, and are only faintly scented. The outer stamens are fused with the tepals for less than 75% of their length, and the anthers are the same colour as the tepals. These two species are thought to have diverged 8000 years ago. The two species hybridise readily to produce fertile offspring known as Hyacinthoides × massartiana; the hybrids are intermediate between <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> species, forming a spectrum of variation which connects the two.|$|E

5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} metamorphosis, {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. <b>The</b> <b>parental</b> investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{bought and}} renovated a €4million house in Killiney outside Dublin during 2002–2003, {{where they were}} living mostly for their children's primary education.

After discussion with the family, U2 went forward with its 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour, but with changed scheduling, reduced dates, and a long postponement of the final leg, all to enable Edge to get home more often.

5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E
5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E
5|$|The third mode is parapatric {{speciation}}. This {{is similar}} to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in {{that there is no}} physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations. Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> species' habitat. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines. Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.|$|E

5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E
25|$|After the replicative helicase has unwound <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> DNA duplex, exposing two {{single-stranded}} DNA templates, replicative polymerases {{are needed}} to generate two copies of <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> genome. DNA polymerase function is highly specialized and accomplish replication on specific templates and in narrow localizations. At the eukaryotic replication fork, there are three distinct replicative polymerase complexes that contribute to DNA replication: Polymerase α, Polymerase δ, and Polymerase ε. These three polymerases are essential for viability of the cell.|$|E
25|$|With {{very large}} pedigrees or with very dense genetic marker data, such as from whole-genome sequencing, it is {{possible}} to precisely locate recombinations. With this type of genetic analysis, a meiosis indicator is assigned to each position of the genome for each meiosis in a pedigree. The indicator indicates which copy of <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> chromosome contributes to the transmitted gamete at that position. For example, if the allele from the 'first' copy of <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> chromosome is transmitted, a '0' might be assigned to that meiosis. If the allele from the 'second' copy of <b>the</b> <b>parental</b> chromosome is transmitted, a '1' would be assigned to that meiosis. The two alleles in the parent came, one each, from two grandparents. These indicators are then used to determine identical-by-descent (IBD) states or inheritance states, which are in turn used to identify genes responsible for diseases.|$|E
