5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
5|$|Wonder Stories had a {{circulation}} of about 25,000 in 1934, {{comparable to that of}} Amazing Stories, which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, Wonder Stories Reprint Annual, but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—Pirate Stories and High Seas Adventures—but neither was successful. Wonder Stories was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> for weeks at a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute Wonder Stories solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 Wonder Stories was sold.|$|E

25|$|According to The New York Times, Canadian {{middle class}} incomes are now {{higher than those}} in the United States as of 2014, and some European nations are closing the gap as their {{citizens}} have been receiving higher raises than their American counterparts.

25|$|One {{afternoon}} in June, Bucey was returning from Tête Jaune Cache {{and had just}} passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank. This {{was a sign that}} someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> in their pockets, all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey.|$|E
25|$|Netflix {{has been}} one of the most {{successful}} dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers. The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> in stock options.|$|E

500|$|At {{seventeen}} {{he moved}} to Hart, Michigan, where {{for a few years}} he worked as a salesclerk. Then he left for Reading, Pennsylvania, where he entered into a partnership with his first cousins. He later donated the Knox Memorial Central School Building (dedicated on July 30, 1913) that served the town until the Knox Memorial School and Edwards Central School merged. [...] He initially became a partner with the Woolworths by jointly opening a Reading, Pennsylvania, Woolworth & Knox store with them on September 20, 1884, using his entire life savings. [...] The Reading store's first several hours had no sales. [...] However, after the partners took a lunchtime walk, they returned at 1:30 to find the local factory workers had been let out at 1:00—with <b>their</b> <b>paychecks.</b> Sales were brisk, and the partners never looked back. [...] His second store, in Newark, New Jersey, was short lived, but his partnership thrived nonetheless. [...] The third venture, in Erie, Pennsylvania, enabled them to buy out the Newark lease. [...] He partnered with Frank to open the first Buffalo store, at 409 Main Street, on October 13, 1888.|$|E
500|$|The New Yorker Anthony Lane {{criticized the}} plot, saying [...] "toss {{everything}} you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such {{appears to be the}} method behind Tower Heist." [...] Lane called the characters [...] "unlikable people" [...] but offered praise to Broderick, saying he [...] "underplays [...] so well." [...] Lane lamented that [...] "the notion of a theft from the thieves from those who are lapped in lofty, screw-you wealth is a tempting one right now, but Tower Heist passes the buck." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film [...] "goes wonky {{on the way to the}} bank, due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> – namely, laughs." [...] Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were [...] "a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes," [...] and while the film [...] "picks up some much-needed momentum" [...] with the actual heist, the [...] "resolution feels rushed." [...] However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance [...] "a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona," [...] and lamenting his limited screen-time.|$|E

50|$|The {{sanitation}} of {{the city}} went under city politics. Most of city sewage and welfare in New York City was headed by Tammany Hall. In 1863 Tammany Hall nominated City Street Inspector Francis I. A. Boole for mayor. Reformists discovered that street cleaning was deeply embedded in corruption. Workers were paid by Tammany Hall below minimum wage and forced to sign contracts that gave up half of <b>their</b> <b>paycheck</b> to Boole.|$|R

2500|$|As Governor, Jerry Brown {{made it more}} {{difficult}} for city council members to dishonestly pad <b>their</b> <b>paychecks,</b> giving his first signature to reform legislation in light of Bell's financial scandal. Brown signed into law Assemblyman Cameron Smyth (R-Santa Clarita)'s legislation, AB 23, which requires city officials to publicize when they are holding simultaneous or back-to-back meetings, and what those attending the meetings will receive in stipends. [...] "The intent is to discourage the potential abuses by making public how much officials are being paid," [...] Smyth said.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimated}} 178 million persons under 65 obtain {{their insurance}} through their employer. Firms are often [...] "self-insured", meaning they reimburse {{the insurance companies}} that pay the medical claims {{on behalf of their}} employees. Employers may use a stop-loss, meaning they pay the insurance company a premium to cover very expensive individual claims (e.g., the firm is self-insured up to a threshold for individual workers). Workers pay a share of their costs to their employers for coverage, basically a premium deducted from <b>their</b> <b>paychecks.</b> Workers also have deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The structure of the insurance plan may also include a Health savings account or HSA, which enable workers to save money tax-free for health expenses.|$|E
2500|$|In many ways, the {{soldiers}} stationed at Fort Douglas were spoiling for a fight. [...] In addition to discipline problems among {{the soldiers}}, {{there was a}} minor [...] "mutiny" [...] among the soldiers where a joint petition {{by most of the}} California Volunteers made a request to withhold over $30,000 from <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} instead paying for naval passage to the eastern states, and to [...] "serve their country in shooting traitors instead of eating rations and freezing to death around sage brush fires..." [...] Furthermore, they stated that they would gladly pay this money [...] "for the privilege (original emphasis) of going to the Potomac and getting shot." [...] This request was declined by the War Department.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the intent}} to defraud {{is an element of}} the crime; therefore, when someone is paying by check where they know {{that they do not have}} enough money to cover the check then, but will have within, say, 3 or 4 days (like a person writing a check just before direct deposit of <b>their</b> <b>paycheck),</b> if they inform the person that the check would bounce, and the party {{deposits}} it anyway, while they would be liable for service charges and possibly fees, informing the person receiving the check that it would bounce if deposited immediately will generally represent evidence that fraud was not intended.|$|R

50|$|The mass {{affluent}} {{have been}} characterized {{as those who}} save more than they spend and invest for their future. While they worry about funding their children's college education, they realize other savings and loan options exist {{and they are not}} opposed to their children paying some part of their educational costs. The mass affluent generally may worry about replacing <b>their</b> <b>paycheck</b> in retirement, and may need to be encouraged to spend more money during their retirement years. They often wish to leave an inheritance to their children. The mass affluent will have between $500,000 and $1.5 million (USD) in investable assets upon retirement with a net worth between $500,000 and $2.5 million (USD). They spend between $4,000 and $10,000 (USD) per month in retirement.|$|R
2500|$|Under Gutiérrez Rodríguez, Unomásuno {{tried to}} {{discredit}} La Jornada, which criticized the PRI government {{and supported the}} movements of the Mexican left. La Jornada supported Cárdenas' political campaigns, the rebellion of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) in the early 1990s, and stood against other ideas promoted by the PRI government that they believed were regressing Mexico, like neoliberalism. Unomásunos efforts to sway public opinion were largely unsuccessful, however, as Mexican public opinion continued to favor independent media outlets like La Jornada. Gutiérrez Rodríguez promised his employees, however, that Unomásunos political stance and editorial tone would not change. Several reporters analyzed the publications done by the newspaper and tried to show Gutiérrez Rodríguez that their critical attitudes towards the Salinas de Gotari administration had changed. They showed him that in one of their recent publications, Unomásuno stated that in the first 100 days of the Salinas de Gortari administration, Mexico had a strong government and clear sense of direction. In addition, Unomásunos attitude towards its staff changed with the new ownership. On March 1989, Gutiérrez Rodríguez warned its employees that Unomásuno was [...] "now a business" [...] and not a [...] "club of friends". He also said he would look into the creation of a syndicate with the board of trustees, but told those interested in the syndicate that they should analyzed whether or not they have worked hard enough to earn <b>their</b> <b>paychecks</b> before asking for money.|$|E
2500|$|Polish Americans {{established}} their own Catholic churches and parishes in the United States. A general pattern whereby laymen joined {{a city and}} united with other Poles to collect funds and develop representative leaders. When the community's size became substantial, they would take the initiative of petitioning a local bishop for permission to build a church with his commitment to supply a priest. Polish immigrants in many instances erected their own churches and then asked for a priest. Roman Catholic churches built with the Polish cathedral style follow a design that includes high ornamentation, decorative columns and buttresses, and many visual depictions of the Virgin Mary and Jesus. When a church was to be built, devout Poles funded their construction with absolute devotion. Some members mortgaged their homes to fund parishes, others loaned monies that their church {{was never able to}} repay, and in St. Stanislaus Kostka parish in Chicago, Poles who lived in abject poverty with large families still donated large portions of <b>their</b> <b>paychecks.</b> Polish parishioners attached great meaning to the successful completion of their churches. Father Wacław Kruszka of Wisconsin told his parishioners, [...] "The house of God must be beautiful {{if it is to be}} for the praise of God", infusing spiritual motivation into his sermons. Perceived mishandling of church funds was not well-tolerated; stories of fistfights and physical assaults on priests suspected of cheating their parishes were well-documented in American newspapers.|$|E
