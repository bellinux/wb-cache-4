2500|$|The {{competing}} {{version of}} events does not mention the secret letter. Instead, after arriving in Rome, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor several months before Anthemius' death, in April or May 472. Ricimer then besieged the part of Rome where Anthemius was for several months until the lawful Emperor was abandoned by his partisans, captured in a church, and put to death by Gundobad, Ricimer's nephew. This version implies that Olybrius was secretly supported by the Emperor Leo, which explains why Leo sent him there. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sources -- Theophanes, the Paschal Chronicle, and Paullus Diaconus—support this version. Edward Gibbon accepts this implication as fact, although {{none of the three}} sources explicitly state that Leo supported Olybrius. What other reason could there be, Bury asks, then answers his own rhetorical question: [...] "the facts that Anthemius was Leo's chosen candidate, his filius, and that Olybrius was the friend of his foe Genseric, are a strong counter-argument." ...|$|E
