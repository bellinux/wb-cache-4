Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is."

500|$|During the World War I era, Southard {{conducted}} {{early studies}} of shell shock. He believed that shell shock {{resulted from the}} mind's inability to align the sensory experiences of war with other life events. Southard said that this process, which could also have physical causes, resulted in disorientation and transformed the events of war into a mental condition. In Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems, he called the term [...] "shell shock" [...] advantageous because it [...] "compared with the more acutely terrible and life-in-the-balance <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> as traumatic or surgical shock." [...] The condition initially captured public interest, {{at least in part}} because it was thought to result from a traumatic force to the head. When shell shock became known as not resulting from physical injuries, patients were stigmatized and arguments over its cause interfered with effective treatment.|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to my stomach that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds. But there is one <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> for sure.

2500|$|The Parthenon's façade {{as well as}} {{elements}} of its façade and elsewhere are said {{by some to be}} circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, [...] "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the Elements (308 BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and decagons was duly observed, {{as well as in the}} dodecahedron (a regular polyhedron whose twelve faces are regular pentagons). It is indeed exemplary that the great Euclid, contrary to generations of mystics who followed, would soberly treat that number for what it is, without attaching to it other than its factual properties." [...] And Keith Devlin says, [...] "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook Elements, written around 300 BC, showed how to calculate its value." [...] Later sources like Vitruvius exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t he want to do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a [...] type sequel. One <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E
2500|$|Dead Artist Syndrome is a {{mainstream}} Christian gothic rock band formed in 1989 in Orange County, California. The group consists of singer-songwriter Brian Healy and a rotating cast of side men. Healy was dubbed the [...] "father of Christian goth" [...] by Rozz Williams, {{and is an}} ordained minister. The name of D.A.S. according to Healy is [...] "Dead Artist Syndrome means greater in death than in life, be it James Dean, Van Gogh or Jesus Christ". His debut album Prints of Darkness was a notable, groundbreaking release. After several years of inactivity in the late 1990s due to health issues, Healy is active again, having released two albums {{so far in the}} 2000s. In 2006, Dead Artist Syndrome was named [...] "Outstanding Orange County Band" [...] by the editors and readers of Rock City News, a Los Angeles local music paper.
