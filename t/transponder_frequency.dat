50|$|Each {{satellite}} {{receiver in}} the installation has a dedicated user band of a bandwidth {{approximately the same}} as a transponder. The receiver requests a particular <b>transponder</b> <b>frequency</b> via a DiSEqC-compliant command. A mixer in the dish-end equipment (an LNB or distribution unit) converts the received signal to the correct user band IF centre frequency for that receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Because many {{of these}} {{broadcasts}} are essentially point-to-point transmissions, the originators often do not follow any international standards when setting various identification fields in the data stream. This causes issues with receivers and software designed for use {{in other parts of}} the world, as they may assume that if a channel contains the same ID information as another channel, those are duplicate channels. This may be a valid assumption {{in other parts of the}} world, but is almost never valid for North American FTA signals. When such an assumption is made, during a [...] "blind scan" [...] the receiver or software will often fail to correctly insert one or more channels into its database, or it may overwrite previously scanned valid channels (including other channels on the same satellite) with invalid information picked up from another, more recently scanned channel. If the end user does not understand what is happening, they may assume that the receiver cannot receive certain channels or that it is defective, yet if the correct data for those channels can be manually entered, those channels may become receivable. This problem can be mitigated if receivers can be set to ignore channels that appear to be duplicates during a [...] "blind scan", except when such channels are on exactly the same satellite and same <b>transponder</b> <b>frequency</b> (as might occur if the user rescans a previously-scanned satellite).|$|E

[...] The primary modification for the AN/MSQ-77 was the control equipment for aircraft guidance (ballistic computer, guidance/release circuitry, and UHF command equipment). The central also had an added beacon tracking capability used when the aircraft had a receiver/transmitter (e.g., Motorola SST-181 X Band Beacon Transponder)http://www.1stcombatevaluationgroup.com/1CEVG_skyspot_history.PDF to increase the range so the radar site could be located farther from the hostile region of bombing targets. Beacon track upgrades included radar circuitry to switch the heterodyne receiver to demodulate the <b>transponder</b> <b>frequency,</b> compensation for the transponder delay, and modification of the central's plotting board circuitry to allow display for increased ranges. The plots were of tracks calculated by the computer's Aircraft Coordinates and Plotting Group which converted radar spherical data to plotting board cartesian coordinates (non-inertial east, north, up coordinate system) using sine/cosine voltages and radar-estimated range respectively from the Antenna Group (azimuth/elevation resolvers) and from the Track Range Computer. Additional A/C Coordinates amplifiers computed the velocity components (not plotted) which along with the track position components were provided as initial bomb conditions to the ballistic computer (Bomb Trajectory Group).|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaAn {{advanced}} {{microwave power}} leveling loop (MPLL) was conceived, designed, fabricated, tested, and used during spacecraft in-orbit testing. The primary {{function of the}} MPLL is to maintain constant RF power transmitted from an earth station antenna during spacecraft in-orbit transponder testing. The MPLL utilizes nonlinear analog electronics with flexible signal path routing under microprocessor control. It achieves a power control dynamic range of greater than 50 dB with better than 0. 1 dB of control resolution. Power level step changes of 20 dB can be accomplished in under 10 ms. The MPLL is IEEE- 488 bus controllable and is designed for use in automated in-orbit test systems to facilitate the measurement process and produce more repeatable results than have previously been possible. Measurements performed {{with the aid of}} the MPLL include <b>transponder</b> <b>frequency</b> response, group delay, gain, and saturation level. The system can also be operated in a manual mode, and utilizes state-ofthe-art human interfacing techniques such as a display/entry panel and a rotary encoder control knob.

40|$|Abstract—Two {{completely}} independent two-way {{time and}} frequency transfer (TWSTFT) links {{have been established}} between the institutions of USNO and PTB, with <b>transponder</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the Ku-band and X-band, respectively. The Ku-band link has some strategic importance, since currently it connects almost {{one half of the}} atomic clocks in the BIPM network that are employed for the realization of TAI. The X-band data are provided as a backup. To reach the full potential of TWSTFT, especially for time scale comparisons, repetitive calibrations of the links are necessary. Since 2002, USNO has scheduled semiannual calibration exercises. We report on the three calibration campaigns in 2004 and early 2005. New calibration values were determined in 2004 and 2005. For the first time, combined uncertainties below 1. 0 ns for both links were achieved. A change of the TWSTFT transmission frequencies or satellite changes in general cause discontinuities in the series of time transfer data and render the previous calibration useless. We describe how we coped with two such events by bridging with X-band and GPS carrier phase data. The previous calibration could be preserved with sufficient accuracy of about a few tenths of a nanosecond. I...|$|R
