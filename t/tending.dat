40|$|Due {{to their}} {{image-based}} nature, "contextual" approaches are very attractive to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from remotely-sensed land surface temperature (LST) data. Their application is however limited to highly heterogeneous {{areas where the}} soil and vegetation temperature endmembers (<b>Tends)</b> can be observed at the thermal sensor resolution. This paper aims to develop a simple theoretical approach to estimate <b>Tends</b> independently from LST images. Soil <b>Tends</b> are simulated by a soil energy balance model forced by meteorological data. Vegetation <b>Tends</b> are obtained from soil <b>Tends</b> and air temperature. Model-derived soil <b>Tends</b> are first evaluated with in situ measurements made over an irrigated area in Morocco. The root mean square difference (RMSD) between modeled and ground-based soil <b>Tends</b> is estimated as 2. 4 [GRAPHICS] C. Model-derived soil <b>Tends</b> are next compared with the soil <b>Tends</b> retrieved from 90 -m resolution ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data collected over two irrigated areas in Mexico and Spain. Such a comparison reveals a strong consistency between model-derived and high-resolution image-based soil <b>Tends.</b> A recent contextual ET model (SEB- 1 S) is then applied to 90 -m resolution and to 1 -km resolution (aggregated) ASTER data using the model-derived or image-based <b>Tends</b> as the input. The RMSD between 90 -m resolution SEB- 1 S and in situ ET is estimated as 65 and 82 W center dot m [GRAPHICS], and the RMSD between 1 -km resolution SEB- 1 S and aggregated SEB- 1 S ET is estimated as 78 and 56 W center dot m [GRAPHICS] for the image-based and model-derived <b>Tends,</b> respectively. In light of the above results, <b>Tends</b> should be estimated a priori when contextual models are applied to low resolution images. Moreover, the consistency over highly heterogeneous areas between model-derived and high-resolution image-based <b>Tends</b> provides a meaningful basis for developing mixed modeling observational approaches...|$|R
