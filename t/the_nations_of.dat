60|$|It {{does seem}} most strange--or rather will seem most strange 100 years hence--that we, <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>of</b> colonists, <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>of</b> sailors, <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>of</b> foreign commerce, <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>of</b> foreign {{military}} stations, <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>of</b> travellers for travelling's sake, <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>of</b> which one man here and another there--as Schleiden sets forth in his book, 'The Plant,' in a charming ideal conversation at the Travellers' Club--has seen and enjoyed {{more of the}} wonders and beauties of this planet than <b>the</b> men <b>of</b> any <b>nation,</b> not even excepting <b>the</b> Germans--that this <b>nation,</b> I say, should as yet have done nothing, or all but nothing, to teach in her schools a knowledge of that planet, of which she needs to know more, and can if she will know more, than any other nation upon it.|$|R

5|$|Odin Sphere is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Vanillaware for the PlayStation 2. It {{was published by}} Atlus (Japan and North America) in 2007, and by Square Enix (Europe) in 2008. A remake titled Odin Sphere Leifthrasir was released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in 2016: Atlus handled publishing duties in Japan and North America, while NIS America published the title in PAL territories. Using a two-dimensional side-scrolling perspective, gameplay focuses on a beat em up-style fighting system while incorporating role-playing elements — Leifthrasir expands upon and refines these elements. The story, shared between both versions, follows five characters on the fantasy continent of Erion during a war between <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> Ragnanival and Ringford over a weapon called the Crystalization Cauldron, and their roles in the Armageddon, a catastrophe which will destroy Erion.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> England and Scotland by the 1280s {{was one of}} relatively harmonious coexistence. The issue of homage did not reach {{the same level of}} controversy as it did in Wales; in 1278 King AlexanderIII of Scotland paid homage to EdwardI, but apparently only for the lands he held of Edward in England. Problems arose only with the Scottish succession crisis of the early 1290s. In the years from 1281 to 1284, Alexander's two sons and one daughter died in quick succession. Then, in 1286, King Alexander died himself, leaving as heir to the throne of Scotland his three-year-old granddaughter, Margaret. By the Treaty of Birgham, it was agreed that Margaret should marry King Edward's then six-year-old son Edward of Carnarvon, though Scotland would remain free of English overlordship.|$|E

5|$|Xenogears {{initially}} {{takes place}} on Ignas, the largest continent of the Xenogears world, and {{the site of a}} centuries-long war between <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> Aveh and Kislev. A church-like organization known as the Ethos has excavated gears (giant robot suits), ostensibly for the preservation of the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.|$|E
5|$|The French and Indian War {{was between}} <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain and France, {{along with the}} {{numerous}} Native American Nations allied with both. The French and Indian war was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War being fought in Europe at the time. Growing population in British territory throughout North America forced expansion west; however, this was met with resistance from the French and their Native American allies. French forces began entering British territory, building numerous forts in preparation to defend the newly acquired land. The {{beginning of the war}} favored the French and their Native American allies, who were able to defeat British forces time and again, and it was not until 1756 that the British were able to hold off their opposition. Pittsburgh was a center for fighting during the French and Indian War, namely because of the geographical location at the center where three rivers unite: the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio. The location of present-day Pittsburgh provided an advantage in naval control. Ownership of this point provided not only naval dominance, but it also expanded economic ventures, enabling shipments to be sent and received with relative ease. French and British forces both claimed ownership to this region; the French installing Fort Duquesne and the British with Fort Pitt. Fort Pitt was established in 1758 after French forces abandoned and destroyed Fort Duquesne. The French and Indian War came to an end in 1763, after British forces were able to secure Quebec and Montreal from the French and on February 10, the Treaty of Paris was signed. The French were forced to surrender their territory in North America, giving England control {{all the way to the}} Mississippi River. The effects of this war were heavily felt in the North American British colonies. England imposed many taxes on colonists in order to control the newly acquired territory. These tensions would soon culminate into a war for independence as well as a shift in power for dominance in the economic world.|$|E

In 1972 <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> Islam took controlling interest in a bank, the Guaranty Bank and Trust Co. <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> Islam-owned schools expanded until, by 1974, the group had established schools in 47 cities throughout the United States.

50|$|Following {{his return}} to Chicago, Elijah Muhammad was firmly in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> Islam. While Muhammad was in prison, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> Islam had stagnated, with fewer than 400 members {{remaining}} {{by the time of}} his release in 1946. However, through the conversion of his fellow inmates as well as renewed efforts outside prison, he was able to redouble his efforts and continue growing <b>the</b> <b>Nation.</b> From four temples in 1946, <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> Islam grew to 15 by 1955. By 1959, there were 50 temples in 22 states.|$|R
