5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
25|$|All of Anselm's dialogues {{take the}} form of a lesson between a gifted and {{inquisitive}} student and a knowledgeable teacher. Except for in Cur Deus Homo, the student is not identified but <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> always recognizably Anselm himself.|$|E
25|$|Teachers can, however, accidentally promote {{cheating}} behavior. A {{study found}} {{a correlation between}} how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating {{as a way of}} getting back at the teacher. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> using a grade curve, are more likely to cheat.|$|E
50|$|As of 2014 all of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> non-Hispanic/Latino White, {{and almost}} all of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> U.S. {{citizens}} and native English speakers, with the exception of <b>the</b> French <b>teacher,</b> a French citizen.|$|R

25|$|By {{engaging}} in interactive and functional interactions {{in a private}} context, dialogue journal partners in educational settings are engaged in collaborative learning and collaborative knowledge building about the topic or task they are working on, each other's experiences and background, and perceptions and thoughts about shared topics. In a classroom setting, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> able to learn about each student's interests, concerns, fears, and experience {{within and outside the}} school.|$|E
25|$|Students are not {{the only}} ones to cheat in an {{academic}} setting. A study among North Carolina school teachers found that some 35% of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another. The rise of high-stakes testing and the consequences of the results on <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> cited as a reason why a teacher might want to inflate the results of their students.|$|E
25|$|Kindergarten {{programs}} in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean kindergartners learn to read, write (often in English {{as well as}} Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.|$|E
30|$|Prompts and hints {{given by}} <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> tend to <b>be</b> at a {{different}} level of language to those from <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> aide Mrs Edgar. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> more likely {{to refer to the}} preceding discourse, while Mrs Edgar refers to the phonology. Thus <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> giving more priority to meaning. The reference to the preceding text is part {{of the way in which}} <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> produce a richer and more cohesive discourse than the other adults.|$|R
50|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 2010 when a relief <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> dismissed after students pushed, swore at and assaulted him. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> ordered {{to leave the}} premises but later took the Department of Education to the industrial relations commission. It <b>was</b> found that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> unfairly dismissed, <b>the</b> students involved having a history of falsely accusing <b>teachers,</b> and <b>the</b> department <b>was</b> ordered to rehire <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> town's <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> also {{placed in}} a {{difficult}} position. They were forced to swear loyalty to Faubus's bills. Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> still expected to attend school every day and prepare {{for the possibility of}} their students' return. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.|$|R
25|$|The {{community}} language learning (CLL) {{is a method}} proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It {{is based on the}} counseling approach in which <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates translation and recording techniques.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita is a Bhagavata {{explanation}} of the Purusha Sukta and the Purushamedha Srauta yajna described in the Satapatha Brahmana. Chapters 7 and 8 of the Bhagavad Gita describe the relationship between teacher and disciple, where <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> viewed as the absolute person, Purusa Narayana. In Chapters 10 and 11 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna begins to instruct Arjuna about the directions of space-time within himself reflecting what is written in the Satapatha Brahmana and Purusa Sukta. The vision of Krishna in his universal form shows the self-devouring nature of the absolute person, {{as described in the}} Satapatha Brahmana and Purusa Sukta. Chapters 12 describes the two paths one chooses after one completes the Purushamedha yajna i.e. become a renunciate or remain as a householder. Chapter 14 is the highest teaching within the Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge to achieve the same state as Purusa Narayana, which is the goal of the Purushamedha.|$|E

50|$|Ridgeway High School {{is known}} to have a diverse student body. The {{enrollment}} for grades 9-12 is roughly 1,500. 77% of the student body is African American, 17% is White, 5% is Hispanic, and 1% makes {{up the rest of the}} population. The promotion rate for the school is 96.5%, and the average class size is 30 students. The same diversity applies to <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> at Ridgeway. 42% of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> African American, 56% of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> White, 2% of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> Hispanic and one faculty member is Asian American.

2500|$|The Silent Way is a {{discovery}} learning approach, invented by Caleb Gattegno {{in the late}} 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> largely silent, giving more space {{for the students to}} explore the language. [...] Students are responsible for their own learning and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think. [...] The role of <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way {{is a good example of}} the Articulatory Approach.|$|E
2500|$|Sati' al-Husri's {{campaigns against}} schools {{suspected}} of being positive towards Persia are well documented. One dramatic example {{is found in the}} 1920s when the Iraqi Ministry of Education ordered Husri to appoint Muhammad Al-Jawahiri as a teacher in a Baghdad school.

2500|$|The focused {{lesson is}} the first phase in a gradual release of {{responsibility}} model. [...] Other names for this are modeling, direct instruction, explicit instruction, or teacher instructed mini-lessons. [...] This is a powerful, but brief, segment of instruction time as it is when the teacher demonstrates, models, and shares what <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>is</b> thinking. [...] The teacher verbalizes their internal thought processes to explain and explicitly show {{the focus of the}} lesson, skills, or concepts. [...] Or the teacher invites the students into their mind to witness their thought process, how it is done and how decisions are made during the task. This {{is not the time to}} simply tell the students things, but to let them know how to do them and why.|$|E

2500|$|Of course, {{achieving}} such a {{goal is not}} automatic nor easy, as {{he suggests}} {{that the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> critical to this process. Students need to be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class. Power is thus distributed amongst the group {{and the role of the}} teacher becomes much more mobile, not to mention more challenging. This encourages the growth of each student's intellectual character rather than a mere [...] "mimicry of the professorial style." ...|$|E
2500|$|For many, education’s {{purpose is}} to train {{students}} for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed {{to meet the needs}} of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). [...] For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The business of <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. [...] Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. [...] It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. [...] If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in production of character(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).|$|E
2500|$|Dapu (打譜) is the transcribing of old tablature into a playable form. Since qin tablature {{does not}} {{indicate}} note value, tempo or rhythm, the player must work it out for him/herself. Normally, qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher or master. They sit facing one another, with the student copying the master. The tablature will only be consulted if <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> not sure of how to play a certain part. Because of this, traditional qinpu do not indicate them (though {{near the end of}} the Qing dynasty, a handful of qinpu had started to employ various rhythm indicating devices, such as dots). If one did not have a teacher, then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves. But it would be a mistake to assume that qin music is devoid of rhythm and melody. By the 20th century, there had been attempts to try to replace the [...] "jianzi pu" [...] notation, but so far, it has been unsuccessful; since the 20th century, qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature. Because qin tablature is so useful, logical, easy, and the fastest way (once the performer knows how to read the notation) of learning a piece, it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced (just as staff notation cannot be replaced for Western instruments, because they developed a notation system that suited the instruments well).|$|E

2500|$|Wade Vroom, an [...] "occasional teacher" [...] at Delta {{alternative}} school, [...] "pinned up brochures {{meant to}} advise gay bar and bath house patrons on safe sex procedures" [...] in a grade seven and eight classroom. Liz Sandals, the minister for education, {{stated that it}} was [...] "totally inappropriate." [...] Sandals also stated, [...] "clearly, from what was described in the media, the materials that were being used are totally inappropriate and are in no way connected to the Ontario health and phys ed curriculum" [...] and [...] "I’m relieved that Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has gotten rid of the material and that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> {{no longer in the}} classroom." [...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children. The fact that an Ontario teacher felt comfortable enough to post it speaks to the cozy relationship the Liberal government has with their unions." [...] MacLeod feels that the Toronto District School Board is [...] "clearly out of control when it comes to this." [...] She also stated that [...] "this {{is not the first time}} something like has occurred there - and I think the government really has to put their foot down and make it known that that type of material is unacceptable." [...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions." [...] MacLeod criticized the spokesman and thinks that the school board should fire someone for the material being posted. The AIDS Committee of Toronto, who published one of the brochures, stated that the intended material published by them was for adults. The Toronto Sun asked in an article, [...] "if the teacher now being paid to be at home, or any adult, were to pass out this material in a park, would the police not be called?" [...] and when is the TDSB going to notify police about a brochure teaching children?"safer sucking tips?" [...] A spokesman for the board stated, [...] "At this time, police have not been notified." [...] Toronto Police Service investigated the brochures and decided that no charges would be pressed against Vroom because it [...] "didn't meet Criminal Code criteria to lay charges for exposing children to obscene material or corrupting the morals of children." [...] Vroom was later reinstated after the issue had been [...] "resolved." ...|$|E
