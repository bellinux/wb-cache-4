5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes <b>them</b> <b>very</b> suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making <b>them</b> <b>very</b> brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in small quantities in the plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes <b>them</b> <b>very</b> dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins {{in large quantities}} made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E

5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making <b>them</b> <b>very</b> expensive.

5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E
5|$|Battlecruisers {{served in}} the navies of the UK, Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Australia and Japan during World War I, most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the Battle of Jutland. British battlecruisers in {{particular}} suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> vulnerable to large-caliber shells. By {{the end of the}} war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship. The Washington Naval Treaty, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped {{under the terms of the}} treaty.|$|E

5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because {{of the way}} that they are lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes <b>them</b> <b>very</b> extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E
5|$|General Alfred T. Torbert was {{commander}} of the union cavalry. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{was part of the}} 2nd Brigade (commanded by Colonel Powell), which was part of the 2nd Cavalry Division (commanded by General Averell). Powell's brigade was positioned on the northwest side of the battlefield between brigades led by Colonel James Schoonmaker and Colonel George Custer. During the battle, Powell sent the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry to the flank and rear of Confederate cavalry consisting of Virginians led by Colonel William H. F. Payne, which was facing Custer's brigade. Powell also sent the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry toward Payne's left flank. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry had been newly armed with 7-shot carbines, and found <b>them</b> <b>very</b> effective against an enemy that was driven from the area in panic. During this time, Confederate General Fitzhugh Lee's horse was shot out from under him, but Lee escaped on another horse.|$|E
5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E

5|$|On {{operations}} {{their performance}} was generally below par, but the Frenchmen {{were involved in}} some successful actions during February and early March 1978. Their oppressive treatment of the black villagers they encountered made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> unpopular in the operational area. The Rhodesians quickly deemed the experiment a failure and following a series of disasters for the company during {{the latter part of}} its second tour, including two friendly fire incidents and several fatalities, it was disbanded in May 1978. Forces led by one of its members, Bob Denard, later that month executed a coup d'état in the Comoros with French, Rhodesian and South African governmental support.|$|E

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes <b>them</b> <b>very</b> useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made <b>them</b> <b>very</b> vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
