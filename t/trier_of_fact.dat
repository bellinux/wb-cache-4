25|$|This, of course, is {{not always}} true. Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to their doctors (to get painkillers {{to which they are}} not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.|$|E
25|$|In this {{specific}} case, a rational <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{such as the}} jurors could have decided {{the question of whether}} Schmuck's scheme constituted mail fraud either way, as indeed Galloway suggested, but that was for the jury to decide.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> has {{no doubt}} as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are {{unreasonable}} doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.|$|E

25|$|If scientific, technical, {{or other}} {{specialized}} knowledge will assist the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{to understand the}} evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto {{in the form of}} an opinion or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{rationale for}} many of the hearsay exceptions is that the circumstances of a particular statement make them reliable enough to be heard by a <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Statements made during the course of medical treatment, for example, are considered reliable because patients typically have little reason to lie to a doctor while they are being treated, and will generally be accurate in describing their ailments.|$|E
25|$|Clear {{and convincing}} proof {{means that the}} {{evidence}} presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality.

50|$|Trial by jury {{does not}} exist in Finland as such. In civil cases, there are no non-professional judges {{involved}} in the process.

25|$|Burden of production: P has to {{show some}} {{evidence}} that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then {{it is up to}} the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).|$|E
25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It {{does not mean that}} no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E

5000|$|The {{propensity}} of litigants and lawyers {{to disregard the}} hierarchy of courts in our judicial system by seeking relief directly from this Court must be put to a halt for two reasons: (1) {{it would be an}} imposition upon the precious time of this Court; and (2) it would cause an inevitable and resultant delay, intended or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases, which in some instances had to be remanded or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedure, or as better equipped to resolve the issues because this Court is not a <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts.</b> LPBS Commercial, Inc., v. Amila and the First Consolidated Bank (FCB) of Bohol, Inc.|$|R
5000|$|Lord President Cooper {{stated that}} [...] "their {{duty is to}} furnish the judge or jury with the {{necessary}} scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence." [...] Therefore, an expert witness should only offer their opinion as to the facts {{that have already been}} established in court, and [...] "should not hinder the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact's</b> duty by telling them how to assess the evidence that they have heard". The weight to be given to the evidence provided by the expert witness is a matter for the judge (in civil, or summary criminal proceedings) or jury (in solemn criminal proceedings) alone.|$|R
25|$|Another {{distinction}} is the unavailability {{of a jury}} in equity: the judge is the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment in Suits at common law, cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The {{question of whether a}} case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 2012 the Trial Chamber {{made its}} oral ruling on motion for a {{judgement}} of acquittal, pursuant to Rule 98 bis of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence, where it granted Karadžić's motion {{in relation to}} count one of the indictment {{in which he was}} charged with genocide for the crimes committed between 31 March 1992 and 31 December 1992 in several municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, leaving only the case of Srebrenica as a count of genocide. On 11 July 2013 the Appeals Chamber reversed the Trial Chamber's acquittal of Karadžić for genocide under Count 1 of the Indictment, and remanded the matter to the Trial Chamber. The Appeals Chamber found that the Trial Chamber erred in fact in concluding that there was no evidence, taken at its highest, based upon which a reasonable <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> could be satisfied that Karadžić and other alleged JCE members possessed genocidal intent, and that this error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
500|$|The {{reasonable}} doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions, but it retains its relevance when {{the trial judge}} considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence. On federal habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, to grant relief, the reviewing court must find that [...] "upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> could have found proof of guilt beyond a {{reasonable doubt}}." [...] In a successive, abusive, or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction, a defendant claiming [...] "actual innocence" [...] must show that [...] "it is {{more likely than not}} that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{plaintiff}} has {{the burden}} of proving each of the essential elements of a cause of action for negligence. The term burden of proof is used in two senses. The first is often called {{the burden of}} going forward with evidence and it means that if the plaintiff does not, in the first instance, introduce evidence on each element which is sufficient to warrant a finding in his favor, he will lose his case {{at the hands of}} the court (by nonsuit, directed verdict, or the like). If the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence (before he rests his case) he has made out a prima facie case and is entitled to go to the jury. His burden of going forward is met and drops out of the case. Thus the burden of going forward with evidence is applied always by the court, never by the jury. Burden of proof in the other sense does not come into play until a case is finally submitted to the jury (or court as <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts)</b> for determination. In that process the trier may find the evidence on any given issue in equipoise [...] or his mind may be in equipoise as to the evaluation of conduct as negligent or careful. In that event, he who has the burden of proof in this sense of the risk of non-persuasion, must fail. This burden is applied by the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> and in a jury case the charge must define this burden and tell the jury how to apply it. In civil cases generally the plaintiff is entitled to prevail if the jury finds that more probably than not the facts are as he alleges. This does not mean all the facts (e. g., every item of negligence) but so many of them as constitute the essential elements of his cause of action as defined by the court in its charge...|$|R
50|$|By {{a divided}} vote, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 262 F.2d 367. It held {{alternatively}} that the assistance was {{not within the}} concept of income of § 61 (a) of the Code, and that in any event the jury's determination that the assistance was a gift, and hence excluded from gross income by § 102 (a), had rational support in the evidence and accordingly was within its province as <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> the <b>facts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} Jury in {{the common}} law as a judge <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> is unique when {{compared}} to civil law systems. The Jury are triers <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in both civil and criminal cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the legal framework. In France a judge’s role as <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>fact</b> is merely as an administrator without creating binding legal principle. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and paternalistic.|$|R
500|$|A 5-4 {{majority}} of the Supreme Court held {{that it was not}} enough for the government to prove [...] "the voluntary commission of an act, such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation, that 'is so inherently inconsistent with the continued retention of American citizenship that Congress may accord to it its natural consequences, i. e., loss of nationality.'" [...] Rather, the court held that its 1967 ruling in Afroyim v. Rusk [...] "emphasized that loss of citizenship requires the individual's 'assent,' ... in addition to his voluntary commission of the expatriating act" [...] and that [...] "the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> must in the end conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship." [...] On that point, the Supreme Court agreed with the 7th Circuit ruling in Terrazas's favor.|$|E
2500|$|Second, the {{scientific}} knowledge must assist the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{in understanding the}} evidence or determining a fact in issue in the case. The <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> is often either a jury or a judge; but other fact finders may exist within the contemplation of {{the federal rules of}} evidence. To be helpful to the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> there must be a [...] "valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a prerequisite to admissibility."

40|$|Although {{the early}} history of the jurata shows it to have been chosen from among those who were {{familiar}} with the controversy and parties before the court, it has long been recognized that the better system attempts to obtain jurors and judges who have no prior knowledge of the dispute to be <b>tried.</b> In furtherance <b>of</b> this policy the voir dire exists to eliminate unwanted jurymen and similar devices have been established to provide for the disqualification of judges. In spite of these protections, the situation still occasionally arises where it is discovered after a trial has begun that the judge or a juryman is possessed <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> to which he should testify. When this occurs there is an immediate conflict between two tenets of the judicial system. It is a basic proposition that all relevant evidence should be presented to the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> while on the other hand the disinterestedness of the tribunal is essential to fairness. Unless this conflict is avoided by the granting of a mistrial and a recommencement of the action before a different judge or jury, there must be a compromise either with the principle of impartiality or a full disclosure. When the Model Code of Evidence and the more recent Uniform Rules of Evidence were formulated, this problem was considered and space given in the final drafts to its solution. It will be {{the purpose of this article}} to investigate these solutions, especially those of the Uniform Rules which resulted from further consideration of evidential problems, and to compare them with the present posture of the law...|$|R
40|$|Theorizing about {{knowledge}} attributions has revolved {{almost exclusively}} around {{the problem of}} skepticism and knowledge attributions in everyday conversations. Sutton (2007), however, points out that Epistemic Contextualism seems to settle another field: 2 ̆ 2 [i]t is sometimes suggested that courtroom proceedings provide a context that shows the context-sensitivity of knowledge ascription truth-conditions 2 ̆ 2 (p. 87). This dissertation {{is devoted to the}} evaluation of this contextualist suggestion (CS). Epistemic Contextualism claims that the correctness of knowledge attributions depends on the salience of error possibilities or the practical states of a knowledge attributor 2 ̆ 7 s context of utterance. I interpret CS implies that the context of utterance is the context of litigation in which a knowledge attributor is at the moment of the attribution. A counter-example for CS is criminal cases in which the conviction of the defendant would meet the epistemic standards of all the knowledge attributors within and without the courtroom (e. g., police officers, the prosecutor, the judge, the jury). However, conviction is not guaranteed because it does not meet the invariant epistemic standards of proof fixed for conviction. My working hypothesis is that knowledge attributions have the purpose of stating that a cognitive agenda has been properly closed. Given that the object of knowledge attributions is cognitive agendas, the conditions under which knowledge is properly attributed depends {{on the nature of the}} cognitive agenda claimed to have been properly closed or advanced. This explains why, in the aforementioned cases, conviction cannot be secure, even if everyone within and without the court knows that the defendant is guilty. One of the closure conditions of conviction is the finding <b>of</b> the <b>facts</b> supporting conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Knowledge is not properly attributed to the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> and conviction is not secured, until such requirement is satisfied. My working hypothesis is also confirmed studying the function of knowledge attributions in our cognitive economies instantiated by criminal investigations, in the attributions of testimonial knowledge as the most important source of legal knowledge, in the attributions of specialized knowledge by the trial judge, and in the attributions of group knowledge to juries and multi-agent courts...|$|R
50|$|As for {{judicial}} review of acts of the administration rather than pieces of legislation, Article 63 of the Danish constitution provides that the judiciary is entitled to try any question relating to the limits to the executive's powers. This is traditionally construed to mean that beyond the sphere of criminal procedure, unless otherwise provided for by legislation, the judiciary may <b>try</b> any question <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and <b>of</b> law, whereas courts traditionally do not review discretion exercised by the administration. In certain areas, however, such as tax law, courts exercise a wider review, {{as well as in}} cases concerning just reparation for expropriation of property, as provided for by Article 73(3) of the Danish constitution. Other areas where the standard of scrutiny may traditionally be less extensive include, inter alia, cases of royal prerogative, such as foreign policy actions of the executive.|$|R
2500|$|The {{burden of}} proof (...) {{is the duty of}} a party in a trial to produce the {{evidence}} that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the {{burden of proof}}. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets their burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The burden of production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> to consider a disputed claim. After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> that their side is correct. There are different standards of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{civil law}} cases, the [...] "burden of proof" [...] {{requires}} the plaintiff {{to convince the}} <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought.

However, in cases of proving loss of future earning capacity, the plaintiff must prove {{there is a real}} or substantial possibility of such a loss occurring.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990 case of Central Alberta Dairy Pool, the Supreme Court of Canada {{overturned}} the 1985 Bhinder decision, saying: [...] "An employer {{that has not}} adopted a policy with respect to accommodation and cannot otherwise satisfy the <b>trier</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> that individual accommodation would result in undue hardship {{will be required to}} justify his conduct with respect to the individual complainant.

60|$|The author cannot {{omit the}} {{opportunity}} of thanking Mr. Frederic Myers for his kindness in reading the proof sheets of the earlier chapters and suggesting some corrections of statement. Mr. Myers, however, is probably not {{in agreement with the}} author on certain points; for example, in the chapter on 'Possession.' As {{the second part of the}} book differs considerably from the opinions which have recommended themselves to most anthropological writers on early Religion, the author must say here, as he says later, that no harm can come <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> how <b>facts</b> look from a new point of view, and that he certainly did not expect them to fall into the shape which he now presents for criticism.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> finder {{is determined}} by the type of proceeding. In a jury trial, it is the role of a jury in a jury trial.
