40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 351) This thesis {{contains a}} methodology for {{implementation of a}} program budget applicable within institutions of higher education. The {{purpose of the study}} is to provide an applied example of program budgeting to an educational institution and show the resultant improvement in the decision-making process that takes place as a result of using these techniques. One study assumes that the institution has three primary outputs: instruction, research, and public service. All costs are expressed in terms of these outputs by allocating supportive costs to them. Program budgeting is defined as a planning and control technique which enables managers to plan and control their short-run and long-run goals better than traditional planning and control techniques would allow. The study is organized two chapters. Chapter I explains the nature of program <b>budgeting</b> by defining <b>the</b> term, providing a brief, history, and outlining the benefits that are to be derived from the use of program budgeting. Chapter II provides the techniques required in order <b>to</b> <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> program <b>budget</b> model.

Finally, recommendations are made in order to facilitate implementation of program budgeting and to make its results more meaningful...|$|R

The government began to have deficits since March of 1998 because medical expenditures exceeded income to the insurance program. Political problems have prevented increasing the funding for the NHI. In order to control medical expenditures, <b>the</b> government began <b>to</b> <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> Global <b>Budgeting</b> System (GBS) in July of 1998. The resultant decreases in funding to the NHI have hindered its work. Because the dentists practiced only outpatient care, and 92 % of their services are primary services, {{they were the first}} group that the government regulated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate how GBS has affected dental service fees and the quality of dental care. The main dental procedures are scaling (primary care), filling teeth (secondary care), and root canal repair and extraction of teeth (tertiary care). This study evaluates these procedures according to their prices, number of procedures performed, materials chosen by dentists in different regions, and the dental care institutions, in order to determine if GBS has actually improved dental services. Most data for this study come from reimbursement data for dental services performed from 1996 to 2001. They include the cases, service fees, materials used in different procedures, dental care institutions, and regions of all contracted providers. Statistical methods are used to develop a model to determine how GBS can direct its funds to provide the best dental care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Individual diet modelling was used to design iso-caloric, nutritionally adequate optimised diets for each observed diet {{in a sample of}} adult normo-reporters aged ≥ 20 years (n = 1, 719) from the Individual and National Dietary Survey (INCA 2), 2006 - 2007. Diet cost was estimated from mean national food prices (2006 - 2007). A first set of free-cost models explored the impact of optimisation on the variation of diet cost. A second set of iso-cost models explored the dietary changes induced by the optimisation with cost set equal to the observed one. Analyses of dietary changes were conducted by income quintiles, adjusting for energy intake, sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables, and smoking status. RESULTS:The cost of observed diets increased with increasing income quintiles. In free-cost models, the optimisation increased diet cost on average (+ 0. 22 ± 1. 03 euros/d) and within each income quintile, with no significant difference between quintiles, but with systematic increases for observed costs lower than 3. 85 euros/d. In iso-cost models, it was possible to design nutritionally adequate diets whatever the initial observed cost. On average, the optimisation at iso-cost increased fruits and vegetables (+ 171 g/day), starchy foods (+ 121 g/d), water and beverages (+ 91 g/d), and dairy products (+ 20 g/d), and decreased the other food groups (e. g. mixed dishes and salted snacks), leading to increased total diet weight (+ 300 g/d). Those changes were mostly similar across income quintiles, but lower-income individuals needed to introduce significantly more fruit and vegetables than higher-income ones. CONCLUSIONS: In France, the dietary changes needed to reach nutritional adequacy without increasing cost are similar regardless of income, but may be more difficult <b>to</b> <b>implement</b> when <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> for food is lower than 3. 85 euros/d...|$|R

2500|$|Subsequent protests {{have not}} had as {{significant}} an impact but did result in panic buying in 2005 and again in 2007. The 2007 fuel protests were put together by {{several members of the}} old [...] "TransAction group" [...] from the South of England, reforming as [...] "TransAction 2007". The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 trucks descending on Central London with the police closing off the A40 fly-over for use as a truck park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at Marble Arch. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many truck owner operators and farmers would have supported the Conservative Party. The Conservative leader David Cameron gave them his support and promised a “fair fuel stabiliser”, a proposal to limit the price of petrol {{that was part of the}} Conservative manifesto for the 2010 UK general election and was announced <b>to</b> be <b>implemented</b> following <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> of March 2011. The “fair fuel stabiliser” which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the oil price rises but the tax will be capped at the level of inflation at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation. Quote from [...] "Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates" [...] section 3.44: [...] "When oil prices are high, as now, fuel duty will increase by the retail prices index (RPI). However, if the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government will increase fuel duty by RPI plus 1 penny per litre. The Government believes that a trigger price of $75 per barrel would be appropriate, and will set a final trigger price and mechanism after seeking the views of oil and gas companies and motoring groups".|$|R
