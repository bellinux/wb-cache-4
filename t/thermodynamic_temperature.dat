25|$|The International System of Units {{specifies}} {{a particular}} scale for <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature.</b> It uses the kelvin scale for measurement and selects the triple point {{of water at}} 273.16K as the fundamental fixing point. Other scales have been in use historically. The Rankine scale, using the degree Fahrenheit as its unit interval, is still in use {{as part of the}} English Engineering Units in the United States in some engineering fields. ITS-90 gives a practical means of estimating the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> to a very high degree of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is defined}} by the third law of {{thermodynamics}} in which the theoretically lowest temperature is the null or zero point. At this point, absolute zero, the particle constituents of matter have minimal motion and can become no colder. In the quantum-mechanical description, matter at absolute zero is in its ground state, which is its state of lowest energy. <b>Thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> is often also called absolute temperature, for two reasons: one, proposed by Kelvin, that it does not depend on the properties of a particular material; two that it refers to an absolute zero according to the properties of the ideal gas.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{internal}} energy changes {{in an ideal}} gas may be described solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the {{internal energy}} of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its pressure, volume and <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

25|$|In November 2000, {{nuclear spin}} {{temperatures}} below 100pK were reported for an experiment at the Helsinki University of Technology's Low Temperature Lab in Espoo, Finland. However, {{this was the}} temperature of one particular degree of freedom –a quantum property called nuclear spin– not the overall average <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> for all possible degrees in freedom.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} cooling {{involves}} removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the null point of the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> scale, also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease {{and they would be}} at complete rest in this classical sense. Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.|$|E
25|$|Temperatures {{that are}} {{expressed}} as negative {{numbers on the}} familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> (expressed in kelvins) can be of a negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature, {{in the sense that}} if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.|$|E

25|$|According to Denbigh, the {{property}} of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined {{without reference to the}} concept of heat. Consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature. All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others. This does not require that they have <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperatures.</b> With reference to hotness, the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.|$|R
25|$|Implicitly {{for this}} definition, the second law of {{thermodynamics}} provides information that establishes the virtuous {{character of the}} temperature so defined. It provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition {{will lead to the}} same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures, which in this sense is universal, or absolute. The second law of thermodynamics also provides that the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> defined in this way is positive, because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another, and the cycle can be imagined to operate only in one sense if net work is to be supplied to the work reservoir.|$|E
25|$|The International System of Units (SI) {{defines a}} scale and unit for the kelvin or <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> {{by using the}} {{reliably}} reproducible temperature of the triple point of water as a second reference point (the first reference point being 0K at absolute zero). The triple point is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure, along with, for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume, an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases, vapour, liquid, and solid, dynamically depending only on the total internal energy {{of the mass of}} water. For historical reasons, the triple point temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{systems that}} are too {{turbulent}} to have temperatures may still differ in hotness. A physical system that passes heat to another physical system {{is said to be}} the hotter of the two. More is required for the system to have a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature.</b> Its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers, and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold. This is part of the reason why heat is defined following Carathéodory and Born, solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter; temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition.|$|E

25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature.</b> Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Absolute, or <b>thermodynamic,</b> <b>temperature</b> is {{conventionally}} {{measured in}} kelvins (Celsius-scaled increments) {{and in the}} Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies {{the size of the}} degree, so the ratios of two absolute temperatures, T2/T1, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It can also be found in Fermi–Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin) and Bose–Einstein statistics (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy (at the particle level) over kT, with k representing the Boltzmann constant and T representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} range in which creep deformation may occur differs in various materials. For example, tungsten requires a {{temperature in the}} thousands of degrees before creep deformation can occur, while ice will creep at temperatures near 0°C (32°F). As a general guideline, the effects of creep deformation generally become noticeable at approximately 35% of the melting point (as measured on a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> scale such as Kelvin or Rankine) for metals, and at 45% of melting point for ceramics. Virtually any material will creep upon approaching its melting temperature. Since the creep minimum temperature {{is related to the}} melting point, creep can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials. Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to creep at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes. Glacier flow is an example of creep processes in ice.|$|E

However, some ambiguity exists in distinguishing between rainfall areas and wet land surfaces...|$|R

25|$|The equipartition theorem makes {{quantitative}} predictions. Like the virial theorem, {{it gives}} the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's heat capacity can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring. For example, it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)kBT in thermal equilibrium, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the (<b>thermodynamic)</b> <b>temperature.</b> More generally, equipartition {{can be applied to}} any classical system in thermal equilibrium, no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the ideal gas law, and the Dulong–Petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids. The equipartition theorem {{can also be used to}} predict the properties of stars, even white dwarfs and neutron stars, since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a {{dimensional}} quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature,</b> amount of substance, and luminous intensity. These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the Planck time, Planck length and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E
25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute temperature, unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature.</b> If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E
