40|$|We {{present a}} tool for {{tracking}} coronary vessels in MRI scans {{of the human heart}} to aid in the screening of heart diseases. The vessels are identified through a single click inside each vessel present in a standard orthogonal view. <b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>identification</b> results from a series of computational steps including eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian of the MRI image followed by a level set-based extraction of the vessel centerline. All identified vessels are highlighted using a virtual contrast agent and displayed simultaneously in a spherical curved reformation view. In cases of over segmentation, the vessel traces can be shortened by a click on each vessel end point. Intermediate analysis results of the vessel computation steps can be displayed as well. We successfully validated the tool on 40 MRI scans demonstrating accuracy and significant time savings over manual vessel tracing. Copyright © 2006 Ingmar Bitter et al.

40|$|The {{blood flow}} {{velocities}} in the basal cerebral arteries can be recorded {{at any age}} by transcranial Doppler sonography. By a standardized examination technique, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>identification</b> is reliable even without visual control of {{the site of the}} sample volume. A stable state of vigilance is necessary to obtain constant recordings. Age has a tremendous influence on the flow velocities. The velocities increase rapidly during the first weeks and reach their maximum around the sixth year of life. The influence of carbon dioxide partial pressure, gestational age, birth weight, hematocrit, and vigilance on the velocities has to be considered. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure are relevant only in cases of extreme values. The clinical applications of transcranial Doppler sonography cover diseases like patent ductus arteriosus, perinatal brain damage, increased intra-cranial pressure, cerebral malformations, brain death, and stenoses and occlusions of main cerebral arteries. The technique is helpful for control of certain therapies. A continuous recording technique has also been developed for this purpose.

Despite the administration of anti-convulsant agents and general care the patient’s condition deteriorated rapidly after admission, culminating in death due to respiratory failure and heart failure 21 days after the onset of symptoms. Post-mortem examination revealed IVL in the brain and multiple organs. Epileptic seizures often appear during the clinical course of IVL; however, they occur most frequently at advanced stages.

PCs got the front page, in the late 1990 s, after the identification and characterization of a new embryonic cell population, the mesoangioblasts, from which PCs present in the adult organism are thought to derive. From these studies, it was clear that PCs were also endowed with multipotent mesodermal abilities. Furthermore, their ability to cross the vascular wall and to reconstitute skeletal muscle tissue after systemic injection opened the way to a number of studies aimed to develop therapeutic protocols for a cell therapy of muscular dystrophy. This has resulted in a major effort to characterize pericytic cell populations from skeletal muscle and other adult tissues. Additional studies also addressed their relationship with other cells of the perivascular compartment and with mesenchymal stem cells. These data have provided initial evidence that PCs from different adult tissues might be endowed with distinctive differentiation abilities. This would suggest that the multipotent mesenchymal ability of PCs might be restrained within different tissues, likely depending on the specific cell renewal and repair requirements of each tissue. This review presents current knowledge on human PCs and highlights recent data on the differentiation properties of PCs isolated from different adult tissues...|$|R

Hypersplenism or severe hemolysis in cases of hematologic disorders represented the most important indications. More than 90 % of the patients underwent total laparoscopic splenectomy. Specific technical details from each center were collected. Intraoperative complications occurred in 19 % of the patients (hemorrhage in 8 % and technical problems in 14 %), and 6 % of the patients required conversion to the open approach. No deaths occurred, and no reoperations were required. Postoperative complications were experienced by 2 % of the patients. Laparoscopic spleen surgery is safe, reliable, and effective in the pediatric population. On the basis of the results, some technical details for laparoscopic spleen surgery can be suggested. The patient is preferably kept supine or lateral, approaching the spleen anteriorly. Moreover, <b>the</b> ilar <b>vessels</b> should be identified selectively and individually, with initial artery division performed to achieve spleen shrinking.

40|$|The {{need for}} aids to {{decision}} making in marine navigation has increased significantly in recent times due to two main factors. The first {{is an increase in}} the complexity of the task {{as a result of the}} greater density of traffic and the 'information overload' on the mariner from various sources. The second factor is an alarming rise in the damage that marine accidents inflict as ships become larger and cargoes more hazardous. The current research, which is part of a project that aims at the obviation of marine traffic accidents through the development of an automated ship control system, is specifically concerned with the task of collision avoidance. A prototype Expert System for open sea two ship encounters was the subject of a previous research project [1]. The extension of this system to handle more complex situations forms the subject matter of this thesis. The major development has been the consideration of several <b>vessels</b> in <b>the</b> decision making process and consequently, the formulation of avoidance strategies for multi-ship encounters. The resolution of emergency situations caused by the untoward action of one of <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> and <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> of an optimal collision avoidance manoeuvre through the application of an appropriate cost function has also been accomplished. The resulting increased complexity of the Expert System necessitated the enhancement of the simulated environment also. This requirement has been fulfilled through the development of a sophisticated marine traffic environment that realistically simulates all the situations handled by the Expert System.

40|$|Background: The endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} {{factor that}} mediates {{the actions of}} acetylcholine is now most frequently identified as nitric oxide. Nitric oxide {{is believed to have}} numerous important regulating actions in neurons, blood vessels, and several other biological systems. Summary of Review: The literature concerning tissue other than cerebral blood <b>vessels</b> supports <b>the</b> conclusion that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor for acetylcholine is either nitric oxide or a compound formed from and containing nitric oxide (for example, a nitrosothiol). However, papers can be found indicating that this endothelium-derived mediator is not nitric oxide. In brain blood <b>vessels</b> <b>the</b> evidence is strongly against the conclusion that nitric oxide is the endothelium-derived mediator for acetylcholine. If this mediator is formed from nitric oxide, either in brain vessels or in other vessels, no data are available delineating how this synthesis is regulated or whether and where nitric oxide leaves the nitroso compound to initiate dilation. Indeed, cerebrovascular data now cast doubt on the commonly held belief that nitrosovasodilators regulate vascular tone by giving off nitric oxide to vascular smooth muscle. Conclusions: In brain blood <b>vessels</b> <b>the</b> chemical identity of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediating the action of acetylcholine is unknown, but this relaxing factor {{does not appear to be}} nitric oxide. If the mediator contains nitric oxide, as is probably the case, the means by which it activates vascular guanylate cyclase and/or produces dilation is unknown. Since this relaxing factor inhibits platelet adhesion/aggregation in cerebral vessels as well as relaxing these <b>vessels,</b> <b>the</b> chemical <b>identification</b> of this relaxing factor and the elucidation of its mode of action are extremely important to our understanding and control of cerebrovascular phenomena in health and disease.

40|$|This {{article will}} discuss three prehistoric {{sites on the}} Slovenian cost, two of which, Sermin and Piran, are {{situated}} on the coast, while the third, Kaštelir above Korte near Izola, is located further a few kilometres further inland. Sermin and Piran were both hillside settlements that extended {{from the top of}} the range to the foothill situated by the sea. Kaštelir, on the other hand, is more typical of the region with settlement focused only at the summit of the hillthis mode of landscape use is known locally as castellier. Sermin has been dated through pottery evidence from the Late Neolithic to the Early Roman period. The prehistoric periods are evidenced especially at the foothill, spanning from the Neolithic, Eneolithic, Bronye and Iron Age, while little material is known from the summit of the hill, which was probably settled during the Iron Age. Kaštelir above Korte represents one of the largest castellieri in Slovenian Istria. The oldest ceramic evidence found herein has been dated to the Eneolithic and the enclave was occupied throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages until Roman times. The most significant artefact recovered from this site was an Apulian krater, the only such example excavated to-date within this region. This find, which probably belonged to a grave within the rampart, demonstrates the importance of the site during the 7 th and 6 th centuries BC. The ceramic evidence from Piran points to a period of occupation spanning from the Eneolithic/Early Bronze Age through the Bronze and Iron Ages to Roman times. During the excavations undertaken in 1988, focussing specifically on the Piazza Vecchia, a nearly complete vessel, possibly an urn, was discovered.
