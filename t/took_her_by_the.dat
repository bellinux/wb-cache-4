25|$|And {{they told}} us, the Inquisitor {{would have us}} separated, because I was weak, and I should go into a cooler room; but Sarah should abide there. I <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm, and said. The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her.

Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was celebrated {{with all due}} tradition in Esma Sultan Palace {{in the presence of}} Sultan's ministers in 1844. One week after that, she was ushered into Esma Sultan's silver-lined carriage in her pearl-trimmed red dress, tiara and bridal veil and sent off to the palace. In those days Sultan Abdülmecid still resided in Topkapı Palace, and he greeted his bride at the main entrance gate into the harem, wearing a splendid uniform with an aigrette plump atop his fez. He <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm and escorted her into the Sovereign's Hall in the palace harem, having her take a seat in the nook that had been prepared for the bride. Mahmud II's daughters and wives came in and joined in the ceremony, as did the wives of important personages.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and was out of sight, but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an electrical box and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and reached into his pocket for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] Folding chairs were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford onto the table and around the building to the triage area.|$|E

6000|$|... "Whither {{should she}} go? Who would have <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand? Who would have {{supported}} her? Would {{you have had}} her lay herself down in the first gutter and die?" ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{a passionate}} desire to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shoulders, but {{put his hand}} on hers instead, and she {{permitted}} it, like one disdainful but helpless. She said something unimportant about the stillness.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{talk about}} being obliged, but get up and give me your hand, and say it shall be a bargain." [...] Then he tried to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand and raise her from the chair up towards him.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Aylmer {{shook her}} head. [...] "I should like much {{to know what}} she has said about that unfortunate {{connection}} before I offer to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand myself. I'm sure Fred will feel that I ought to do so." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm. His {{hand was}} cold, and loose, and {{scarcely}} closed upon her.|$|E

6000|$|At {{these words}} there came into Olive's face an {{expression}} {{which made her}} companion cross over to <b>her</b> directly and <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand. But the tone was different from what Verena expected, when she said, with cold surprise: [...] "Oh, you are in correspondence!" [...] It showed an immense effort of self-control.|$|R
60|$|I looked {{towards the}} end of the walk. All I saw at the {{distance}} was that Rosanna suddenly turned round, the moment Mr. Franklin had spoken.

60|$|Listening {{more and}} more impatiently, Hardyman <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand, and burst out with another of his abrupt questions.|$|E

60|$|Virginia stood up, {{faint and}} dizzy. The work {{of her hands}} had {{sustained}} her while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.

60|$|She sobbed {{the more}} at {{sight of the}} grisly lady, and almost screamed when Grisell smiled and tried to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand.

60|$|She {{turned to}} enter the bed-chamber. Acting headlong on the impulse of the moment, I <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand and stopped her.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{does and}} she doesn't. As a sweet, nice child she shrinks from it; {{but as a}} 'psychic,' as they call her, she has no choice.

6000|$|... "But a wife doesn't {{always want}} to be made a widow even if her husband be bad. I think I owe her {{something}}, and I would pay my debt if I knew how.
