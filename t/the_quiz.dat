5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>quiz</b> show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

30|$|On {{a related}} note, it is {{possible}} that students who did not attend class may have completed <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> after they studied. If so, then <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> would not be advance quizzes for those students. Similarly, {{it is possible}} that students accessed <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> during class time and used them as study guides during the lecture rather than using them before learning. If so, <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> would not be advance quizzes for those students. In order to control for these possibilities further analyses were conducted to test for the independent contribution of advance quizzing. In these analyses, the focus was on those students who completed <b>the</b> advance <b>quizzes</b> during class, and specifically, during {{the first part of the}} lecture as instructed. In addition, instances in which students also accessed <b>the</b> advance <b>quiz</b> after <b>the</b> lecture were excluded. The results of these analyses showed that advance quizzing before learning contributed exclusively to performance in the final exam over and above the other two variables.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>quiz</b> is {{the primary}} device of {{eliminating}} contestants across all series. Traditionally between ten and twenty questions, <b>the</b> <b>quiz</b> asks the players to identify the Mole and several pieces of information regarding the Mole, including the Mole's activity in challenges, biographical profile, their fashion and/or culinary choices during the show, etc. The player scoring lowest on <b>the</b> <b>quiz</b> (and taking the longest time to do so, {{in the event of}} tied scores) is eliminated from the game. The US version saw a format change from twenty questions to ten questions from Season 2 on, usually with all questions available to the public. Season 5 of the Australian series had contestants answer five questions about the Mole (not filmed), plus a further five questions for the live eliminations. On two separate occasions, the live elimination computer quiz system malfunctioned and didn't record some contestants' responses. The rules stated that if this were to happen the elimination would be based on the five questions answered before the live show.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of optional online quizzes written by peer tutors in a pharmacology course for doctor of pharmacy students. Methods. Online quizzes were written by peer tutors for second-year pharmacy students. <b>Quizzes</b> reflected <b>the</b> material taught during lecture and were in a format {{similar to that of}} the examinations. Data related to performance on each quiz and each examination were collected throughout the semester. At the end of the semester, students and peer tutors were surveyed to gather information on the utility and success of <b>the</b> <b>quizzes.</b> Results. Students taking online quizzes performed significantly better on examinations than those who did not take quizzes. In addition, students received higher scores on examinations than when practicing with <b>the</b> <b>quizzes.</b> Surveys suggest that students liked <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> and felt they increased their confidence and performance on examinations. Conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>quizzes</b> were beneficial to student performance on examinations as well as student perception of performance and confidence going into <b>the</b> examinations. <b>Quizzes</b> were also beneficial learning experiences for peer tutors...|$|R

30|$|The {{previous}} analyses {{evaluated the}} impact of the interventions assuming that <b>the</b> advance <b>quizzes</b> were always used before learning. However, {{it is possible that the}} students who did not attend class may have completed <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> after they studied. If so, then <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> would not be advance quizzes for those students. It is also possible that students accessed <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> during class time and used them as study guides during the lecture rather than using them at the beginning of the lecture as instructed. Again, if so, <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> would not be advance quizzes for those students. In order to control for these possibilities further analyses were conducted. In these analyses, the focus was on those students who completed <b>the</b> advance <b>quizzes</b> during class, and specifically, during the first part of the lecture as instructed. The latter was possible due to the availability of the exact time stamp of the access to <b>the</b> advance <b>quiz.</b> To allow for a proper measurement of {{the impact of}} advance <b>quizzing</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of the lecture, instances in which students also accessed <b>the</b> advance <b>quiz</b> after <b>the</b> lecture were excluded. As no time stamp information was available for the access to the podcast it was not possible to apply the same restrictions to those students who did not attend class. With these restrictions, the mean number of uses of advance <b>quizzing</b> during <b>the</b> lecture was 3.91 (SD[*]=[*] 3.65) for first-year students and 2.79 (SD[*]=[*] 3.60) for second-year students, which was statistically significant, t(508)[*]=[*] 3.44, p[*]<[*]. 01.|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{the second}} {{research}} question of student perceptions, findings reveal {{that those who}} responded to the survey were generally very favourable toward <b>the</b> adaptive <b>quizzes,</b> in line with recent research that students enjoy adaptive quizzes and technologies (Becker-Blease & Bostwick, 2016; Griff & Matter, 2013; House et al., 2016; Rossano, Pesare, & Roselli, 2017) and perceive that they help them with their learning. Most of the students enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> and would like to experience them again. Students appreciated the instant feedback provided by <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> and <b>the</b> regularity of the feedback motivated students. The main aspect of <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> that students would like to see improved was to provide more comprehensive feedback, particularly regarding the details of where students had gone wrong in their calculations. Interestingly, the aspects of <b>the</b> <b>quizzes</b> that students liked, such as regular and instant feedback, were not specific to adaptive quizzes, but could apply more generally to any form of online formative assessment. As such, adaptive multiple-choice quizzes should be viewed as just one of many types of online assessments capable of delivering formative feedback. Further research could also examine whether more comprehensive feedback would have yielded better outcomes for the students.|$|R
