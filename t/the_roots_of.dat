50|$|<b>The</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> a word is unit {{of meaning}} (morpheme) and, as such, {{it is an}} abstraction, though it can usually be {{represented}} in writing as a word would be. For example, {{it can be said}} that <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English verb form running is run, or <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish superlative adjective amplísimo is ampli-, since those words are clearly derived from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> forms by simple suffixes that do not alter <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> in any way. In particular, English has very little inflection and a tendency to have words that are identical to their roots. But more complicated inflection, as well as other processes, can obscure the root; for example, <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> mice is mouse (still a valid word), and <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> interrupt is, arguably, rupt, which is not a word in English and only appears in derivational forms (such as disrupt, corrupt, rupture, etc.). <b>The</b> <b>root</b> rupt is written as if it were a word, but it is not.|$|R

5|$|Extirpation {{of prairie}} dogs can also {{contribute}} to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs.
