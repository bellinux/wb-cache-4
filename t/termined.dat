40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} use structured representations of the environmentâs dynamics to constrain and speed up the planning process. Given a problem domain described in a probabilistic logical description language, we develop an anytime technique that incrementally improves on an initial, partial policy. This partial solution is found by ï¬rst {{reducing the number of}} predicates needed to represent a relaxed version of the problem to a minimum, and then dynamically partitioning the action space into a set of equivalence classes with respect to this minimal representation. Our approach uses the envelope MDP framework, which creates a Markov decision process out of a subset of the full state space as de- <b>termined</b> by the initial partial solution. This strategy permits an agent to begin acting within a restricted part of the full state space and to expand its envelope judiciously as resources permit...|$|E
40|$|Noise Radar is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} technology which uses noise or pseudo-noise waveforms as sounding signals to de- tect targets of interest. The advantages of such waveforms are no range nor velocity ambiguities, {{the possibility of}} using continuous waveform and low probability of intercept. However, the noise waveform correlation sidelobes are spread across the entire range–Doppler plane and their level is de- <b>termined</b> by the time-bandwidth product. Such sidelobes limit the detection capability in the multitarget environment. Several algorithms exist that decrease the sidelobe level and thus enhance dynamic range of the radar, but they are very susceptible to distortions in an analogue channel. In this paper the author presents a method to create low-sidelobe waveforms using a filtering algorithm designed for given channel, decreasing the analogue front-end impact on the final properties of the waveforms...|$|E

The structural model used resembles a 5 -story build ing about 2. 5 meters high. The building model was subjected to a variety of direct-force excitations. The control algorithm used employs an adaptive structural member at a prede <b>termined</b> location in the model in order to attenuate the structural response relative to the moving building foundation. An electromagnetic actuator is used to generate the required control faces in the "smart" member. Among the key features of the algorithm under dis cussion are: 1.

40|$|Diversity and {{regulation}} of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels {{play a vital}} role in many important physiological processes such as delineation of the final urine composition, sensory transduction, and whole-body Na+ homeostasis. These channels display a wide range of biophysical properties, and are regulated by cAMP-mediated second messenger systems. The first of these channels has recently been cloned. This cloned amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel is <b>termined</b> ENaC (Epithelial Na+Channel) and, in heterologous cellular expression systems, displays a single channel conductance of 4 to 7 pS, a high PNa/PK (> 10), a high amiloride sensitivity (Kiamil = 150 nM), and relatively long open and closed times. ENaC may form the core conduction element of many of these functionally diverse forms of Na+ channel. The kinetic and regulatory differences between these channels may be due, in large measure, to unique polypeptides that associate with the core element, forming a functional channel unit...|$|E
