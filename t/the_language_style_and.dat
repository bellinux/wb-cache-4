Like our other oral products, tales have a function which perpetuates our culture in its structure and also reflects and carries {{it to the}} coming generation. As is known, tales have a specific and visible structures and forms. When tales are transferred to the coming generations, this structure maintains itself and does not change. In tales, the usage of these factors, which we call it as formal, shows or contains some differences according to the story-tellers’ proficiency or mastery. In addition to these differences, some sayings, which the teller adds to the tale /story by himself /herself related to his (or her) character and the atmosphere which he (or she) was grown up are effective factors in formation of <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>style</b> of <b>the</b> tale /story. The Aim of the Research: To stabilize <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>style</b> of <b>the</b> tale that is generally an oral literature product by using <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> of the story-tellers from Balikesir. Data Sources: The tales which are compiled from Balikesir. Discussion and Result: One story-teller must maintain the formal structure that the tradition/ custom requires while he (or she) is spinning a yarn. Moreover, the story-teller includes the surprising expressions, the style of address or vocative sayings to the listeners who are across him/her, such feelings as anger and love, which they show the heroes of the tale, {{in the structure of}} the story /tale.

Due to they articulate their intention, they use the style which emerge as the variances of the language. Everyone produces difference style to convey his or her purposes which entail the listeners to provide the responses. They, therefore, convince the listeners with the most favourable style in order to they understand and trust their thoughts. It is very fascinating to investigate the language style {{that is used by}} Hilary Clinton as the presidential nomination from Democratic Party in the United States in her political speeches to the critical mass’ responses. How is the impact between <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> the critical mass responses on the styles of Hillary Clinton’s political speeches? What language styles that are used by Hillary Clinton in her political speeches? What kind of critical mass’ responses that emerge as the reactions to Hillary Clinton’s political speeches? How is the relation between language style used by Hillary Clinton’s political speeches and the critical mass responses? Theoretically, the writer uses <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> the socio- psychological approach to answer the problems. The language style induces to recognize the types of the style that is used by Hillary Clinton’s political speeches either formal or informal style while socio-psychological approach converses the relationship between the speaker’s language and listeners’ responses. Methodologically, the writer asserts descriptive qualitative study as research design, the data are collected by skimming and scanning, and analyzed by intensive reading and inter-textual reading process. The finding shows that Hillary Clinton uses formal and informal style with it’s variances in it. Those are colloquial and slang style. The most frequently style that is found in Hillary Clinton’s political speeches is informal style with colloquial as the dominant than slang style. Due to Hillary uses informal style in her political speeches, it influences the critical mass to give informal responses. They declare tree kinds of responses. Those are cognitive, affective and behavioural responses. Actually, there is no direct relationship between the styles and the responses. The messages of the statement are usually believed as more influential than the style’s impact. But, as a linguistic researcher, the writer consider that the statement is too simplified, since the messages can be facilitated or constrained by the language style...|$|E

40|$|It {{is really}} just like fishing [...] . what you catch depends on the bait {{you put on the}} line”: The {{construction}} of friendships between beachboys and tourists on the shores of Lake Malawi For every formal job in the tourism industry in Malawi there are many people who, usually in an ad-hoc and opportunistic way, derive an, albeit irregular, income from tourism. This paper focuses on this ‘informal sector ’ and analyses the methods through which Malawian beachboys build relationships with budget tourists on the beaches of Lake Malawi. It is argued that simply viewing such beachboys as marginal ‘cultural brokers ’ ignores the intentional and detailed construction of particular cultural styles to create and sustain interest and trust in different types of transient visitors. Particular cultural styles, as exhibited in <b>the</b> <b>language,</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> image used by beachboys, vary according to current ‘market ’ requirements, and that the competent performance of such styles requires time, investment and experience. These observations are related to Ferguson’s discussions of sub-cultural style, signifying practice and performative competence in relation to return migration on the Zambian copperbelt. It is suggested that the success of beachboys in performing particular cultural styles is partially due to the limited ability of temporary tourists to decode ‘signifiers ’ in the Malawian context...|$|E

The strong acquaintance of the poet with the conventions of court literature, the occasional content of the poem and its panegyric character, suggest that the text was written for a small ceremony which took place at Dorylaion.

40|$|There is an {{abundance}} of {{evidence to suggest that}} online behavior differs from behaviors in the offline world, and {{that there are a number}} of important factors which may affect the communication strategies of people within an online space. This article examines some of these, namely, whether the sex, age, and identifiability of blog authors, as well as the genre of communication, affect communication strategies. Findings suggest that the level of identifiability of the blog author has a limited effect upon their communication strategies. However, sex appeared to influence online behavior in so far as men were more likely to swear and attack others in their blogs. Genre had an important influence on disclosure with more self-disclosure taking place in the diary genre (i. e., blogs in which people talk about their own lives) comparative to the filter genre (i. e., blogs in which people talk about events external to their lives). Age affected both self-disclosure and language use. For example, younger bloggers tended to use more swearing, express more negative emotions and disclose more personal information about others. These findings suggest that age, sex, genre, and identifiability form a cluster of variables that influence <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> self-disclosure patterns of bloggers; however, the level of identifiability of the blogger may be less important in this respect.
