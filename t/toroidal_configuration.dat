Using these equations, we analyze the phase separation/mixing in the pipe with periodic axial boundary conditions, i. e. in a <b>toroidal</b> <b>configuration.</b> We find that {{the onset of the}} mixing, in the form of suction, i. e., filling the empty core in the vortical component by its nonrotating counterpart, crucially depends on the vorticity of the first component, and on the strengths of the inter-atomic interactions.

The results show an increase in the Hα emission along the jet for the magnetized cases with respect to the HD case. The increase in the emission is due to a better collimation of the jet in the MHD case, and to a small increase in the shock velocity.

In the absence of longitudinal current, it is possible to have a domain of stability in a system with a horizontally elliptical (and triangular) deformation with an ellipticity corresponding to (a= 2 b) i. e. the minor axis is twice the major axis.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a migrating cloud of particles with electrohydrodynamic interactions is numerically investigated. The hydrodynamic interaction is modelled by Oseen dynamics {{in the limit of}} small-but-finite particle Reynolds number. The effects of external field and the particle-particle Coulomb repulsion, calculated through pairwise summation, are quantified by a charge parameter, κq. With a small or zero κq, the cloud is seen to flatten into a <b>toroidal</b> <b>configuration</b> and eventually breaks up into two small clouds, indicating that the external electrostatic field has a similar effect with gravity. Increasing the long-range Coulomb repulsion can delay or even totally prevent the breakup. With sufficiently strong repulsion, the cloud undergoes a self-similar expansion. Finally, we show that the breakup of the cloud is strongly related to the initial inhomogeneity of the particle concentration. This chaotic characteristic, however, is dramatically depressed by the long-range Coulomb repulsion...|$|E

Following our previous studies of charged test particles and uncharged perfect fluid tori encircling compact objects, we introduce here a simple test model of a charged perfect fluid torus in strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields. In contrast to ideal magnetohydrodynamic models, we consider here the opposite limit of negligible conductivity, where the charges are tied completely to the moving matter.
