40|$|The various {{segments}} of <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct have interesting and {{important roles in}} the urinary concentrating mechanism. On one hand, <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct contributes insignificantly to the medullary interstitial concentrating process, {{but on the other}} hand, urinary concentration occurs as the result of water abstraction from <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct as it courses from the cortex to the papillary tip. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct seems to do little work for medullary concentration. It, nevertheless, gets credit for regulation of the final urine osmolality. The latter occurs as a consequence of finely tuned mechanisms which regulate <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct's water permeability in an ambience where the interstitial osmolality is controlled by highly integrated mechanisms involving numerous different nephron segments. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the specific role of each segment of <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct in <b>the</b> urinary concentrating mechanism, while other contributions in this Symposium will discuss the water permeability of <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct and <b>the</b> generation and maintenance of the medullary interstitial osmolality...|$|R

40|$|Anatomy {{and cell}} morphology. <b>The</b> rabbit <b>collecting</b> tubule {{originates}} {{near the surface}} of the kidney, descends through the cortex within the medullary rays and traverses the outer medulla as an unbranched structure. <b>The</b> cortical <b>collecting</b> tubule (CCT) receives the contents of an average of 6 nephrons [1]. The fusion of these nephrons generally occurs proximal to the origins of <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> tubule. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> tubule is unbranched from the superficial portion of the cortex until it reaches the inner medulla where <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> tubules begin to fuse to form larger and larger ducts eventually exiting through the papillary tip. Figure 1 schematically represents <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> tubule as it courses through the cortex and medulla. The fact that the cortical and outer medullary collecting tubule (OMCT) in the rabbit are unbranched facilitates their examination using the technique of in vitro perfusion of isolated nephron segments...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>collecting</b> ducts {{are formed}} in the renal cortex by the {{connection}} of several nephrons. They descend within the medullary rays of the cortex, penetrate the outer medulla, and in the inner medulla successively fuse together. Based on these topographical considerations, we can recognize three segments of <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct system: <b>the</b> cortical <b>collecting</b> tubule, <b>the</b> outer medullary <b>collecting</b> duct, and <b>the</b> papillary <b>collecting</b> duct. In this review, we call papillary collecting duct (PCD) that part of <b>the</b> <b>collecting</b> duct system that extends from the junction of outer medulla and inner medulla to the area cribosa. <b>The</b> <b>collecting</b> ducts in <b>the</b> outer medullary zone rarely have branches; however, such branches present in the inner zone have hampered study by micropuncture and microcatheterization techniques. <b>The</b> cortical <b>collecting</b> tubule (CCT) contains two types of cells, principal and intercalated cells, whereas in most animals the PCD contains only principal cells [1]. The general ultrastructure of the PCD cell seems simpler than that of <b>the</b> cortical <b>collecting</b> tubule, suggesting that the PCD is less specialized and less metabolically active than other nephron segments [2]. However, the accumulated data reveal a remarkable reabsorptive capacity for water and sodium by the PCD [3 – 6], thus indicating that this final part of the nephron {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of salt and water balance...|$|R
