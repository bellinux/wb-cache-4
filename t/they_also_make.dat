5|$|The usual call is {{an eerie}} high-pitched wailing contact call, kee-ow... kee-ow... kee-ow, made while flying or roosting, {{and can be}} heard from afar. Birds may also make a harsh {{screeching}} alarm call. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> a soft, chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call with some success.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} metamorphosis, {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E

25|$|Several {{adaptations of}} Duployan were {{developed}} for writing English, including those by Helen Pernin, J. Matthew Sloan, Denis Perrault, Carl Brandt, and George Galloway. The Pernin, Perrault, and Sloan shorthands are distinguished from other Duployan shorthands {{by the presence}} of the quarter-arc compound consonants. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of affix marks, and omit redundant vowels. Galloway and Brandt shorthands are not included in the Duployan Unicode proposal.|$|E

25|$|The {{improvement}} in the results came from both having an extra 2 years of measurements (the data set runs between midnight on August 10, 2001 to midnight of August 9, 2006), as well as using improved data processing techniques and a better characterization of the instrument, most notably of the beam shapes. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of the 33nbsp&GHz observations for estimating cosmological parameters; previously only the 41nbsp&GHz and 61nbsp&GHz channels had been used.|$|E

25|$|Because {{they are}} working dogs, PWDs are {{generally}} content in being at their master's side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are {{willing and able to}} follow complex commands. They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training, and have a long memory for the names of objects.

25|$|The {{defensive}} bombardier behaviour {{is never}} used against ants. Males of some species {{are attracted to}} lights during {{some parts of the}} season and are thought to disperse from one ant nest to another. Males are thought to be short-lived. These beetles feed on ant eggs, larvae and adults by piercing their mandibles into the abdomen or other soft part and sucking the contents. Apart from chemical mimicry and communication with their hosts, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of vibrations. Several stridulatory structures are found in these beetles including alary-elytral, abdomen-femur and thorax-femur combinations of surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Sandstone is one stone worked traditionally, with {{hammer and}} chisel, in the state, {{with one of}} the main {{products}} being gravestones.
