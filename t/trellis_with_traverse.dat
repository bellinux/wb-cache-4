30|$|Joint {{source and}} channel {{decoding}} (JSCD) {{has been proved}} to be an effective technique which can improve decoding performance by exploiting residual source redundancy. Most previous publications on this subject focus on a traditional coding scheme in which the source variable-length coding (VLC) is serially concatenated with a channel code. In this paper, a parallel concatenated coding scheme for the VLC combined with a turbo code is presented. By merging a symbol-level VLC <b>trellis</b> <b>with</b> a convolutional <b>trellis,</b> we construct a symbol-level joint <b>trellis</b> <b>with</b> compound states. Also, a solution of the symbol-by-symbol a posteriori probability (APP) decoding algorithm based on this joint trellis is derived, which leads to an iterative JSCD approach in the similar way to the classical turbo decoder. The simulation results show that our joint source-channel en/decoding system achieves some gains at the cost of increasing decoding complexity, when compared to the joint iterative decoding based on the bit-level super trellis for the separate coding system.|$|R

It is proved that any minimal tail-biting trellis can be constructed by the recursive process of embedding constructions from the well-known Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) constructed conventional trellises. Furthermore, several properties of embedding constructions of tail-biting trellises are discussed.

30|$|Also, as Fig.  5 depicts, welding <b>with</b> higher <b>{{traverse}}</b> speed {{reduces the}} tensile strength. This {{could be because}} of the fact that in higher traverse speed, faster movement of tool leads to poor mixing of the material. In other words, welding <b>with</b> smaller <b>traverse</b> speed allows the two sheets to get enough time for mixing and homogenization. Therefore, weld line deflection and deformation in samples <b>with</b> higher <b>traverse</b> speed lead to poor material mixing and consequently weak tensile strength.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we present}} an {{improved}} index-based a-posteriori probability (APP) decoding approach for the error-re-silient transmission of packetized variable-length encoded Markov sources. The proposed algorithm {{is based on}} a novel two-dimen-sional (2 -D) state representation which leads to a three-dimensional <b>trellis</b> <b>with</b> unique state transitions. APP decoding on this trellis is realized by employing a 2 -D version of the BCJR algorithm where all available source statistics can be fully exploited in the source decoder. For an additional use of channel codes the proposed ap-proach leads to an increased error-correction performance com-pared to a one-dimensional state representation.
