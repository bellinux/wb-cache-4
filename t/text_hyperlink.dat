Although they can be customized, these text hyperlinks generally share a standardized recognizable format, blue text with underlining. Hyperlinks differ from the functional computer icons {{in that they are}} normally embedded in text, whereas icons are displayed as stand-alone on the screen real estate. They are also displayed in text, either as the link itself or a friendly name, whereas icons are defined as being primarily non-textual.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of video-based sign language (SL) navigation aids to improve Web search for Deaf Signers was tested by two experiments. Experiment 1 compared 2 navigation aids based on text hyperlinks linked to embedded SL videos, which differed in the spatial contiguity between the <b>text</b> <b>hyperlink</b> and SL video (contiguous vs. distant). Deaf Signers ’ performance was similar in Web search using both aids, but {{a positive correlation}} between their word catego-rization abilities and search efficiency appeared in the dis-tant condition. In Experiment 2, the contiguous condition was compared with a text-only hyperlink condition. Deaf Signers became less disorientated (used shorter paths to find the target) in the text plus SL condition than in the text-only condition. In addition, the positive correlation be-tween word categorization abilities and search only appeare...|$|E
40|$|A {{web page}} {{generally}} includes {{elements such as}} <b>text,</b> <b>hyperlink,</b> image, etc. Hyperlink represents a relationship between two web pages or just between sections of the same page. Understanding the hyperlink structure is fundamental to understanding the Web connectivity structure, because hyperlinks {{have been used in}} web indexing and information retrieval, as well as page ranking. If the Web were a car, hyperlinks would be the engine, because without them, we are not going anywhere. It can be concluded that search engines consider that any words used by other sites to describe a site is particularly relevant even if the keywords are not used in the backlinked site/page (the linked target destination). In other words, the foreign language text links allow the linked sites {{to have a chance to}} be retrieved as relevant results in response to a search query. Many search engines judge the linking page partly based on the quality of the linked page, and if many sites backlinking to a site use keywords in their link text, search engines will raise its ranking for those keywords. Ultimately, backlinks from popular websites with a higher ranking, have a higher weight then backlinks from smaller unknown websites...|$|E

2500|$|A {{database}} program HyperCard {{was released in}} 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the Gopher protocol from 1991. [...] It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the Mosaic browser (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). [...] HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, <b>text,</b> and <b>hyperlinks,</b> unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured <b>text</b> and <b>hyperlinks.</b>|$|R

Composite kernel method is one topic of inter-est among them. It first selects a bunch of initial kernels, {{each of which is}} determined separately by a certain type of features. Then a classifier is trained based on a linear com-bination of these kernels. In this paper, we propose an ef-fective way to optimize the linear combination of kernels. We proved that this problem is equivalent to solving a gen-eralized eigenvalue problem. And the weight vector of the kernels is the eigenvector associated with the largest eigen-value. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained based on this optimized combination of kernels. Our experiment on the WebKB dataset has shown the effective-ness of our proposed method. 1...|$|R
40|$|Exploratory search, {{in which}} a user investigates complex concepts, is {{cumbersome}} with today’s search engines. We present a new exploratory search approach that generates interactive visualizations of query concepts using thematic cartography (e. g. choropleth maps, heat maps). We show how the approach can be applied broadly across both geographic and non-geographic contexts through explicit spatialization, a novel method that leverages any figure or diagram – from a periodic table, to a parliamentary seating chart, to a world map – as a spatial search environment. We enable this capability by introducing explanatory semantic relatedness measures. These measures extend frequently-used semantic relatedness measures to not only estimate the degree of relatedness between two concepts, but also generate human-readable explanations for their estimates by mining Wikipedia’s <b>text,</b> <b>hyperlinks,</b> and category structure. We implement our approach in a system called Atlasify, evaluate its key components, and present several use cases...|$|R

30|$|A blog, {{which is}} short for Weblog, is a {{collection}} of personal journal entries, published online and presented chronologically, to which readers (or subscribers) may respond by providing additional commentary or feedback. In order to create a blog, one must compose content for an entry, which may include <b>text,</b> <b>hyperlinks,</b> graphics, audio, or video, publish the content online using a blogging application, and alert subscribers that new content is posted. Blogs may be informal and personal in nature or may serve as formal commentary in a specific genre, such as in politics or education (Coghlan et al., 2007). Fortunately, many blog applications are free, and many learning management systems (LMSs) offer a blogging feature that is seamlessly integrated into the online classroom. The ease of blogging has attracted attention from educators, who currently use blogs as an instructional tool for the expression of ideas, opinions, and experiences and for promoting dialogue {{on a wide range of}} academic topics (Garrity, Jones, VanderZwan, de la Rocha, & Epstein, 2014; Wang, 2008).|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, many {{applications}} {{are interested in}} detecting and discovering changes on the web to help users to understand page updates and more generally, the web dynamics. Web archiving {{is one of these}} fields where detecting changes on web pages is important. Archiving institutes are collecting and preserving different web site versions for future generation. A major problem encountered by archiving systems is to understand what happened between two versions of web pages. In this paper, we address this requirement by proposing a new change detection approach that computes the semantic differences between two versions of HTML web pages. Our approach, called Vi-DIFF, detects changes on the visual representation of web pages. It detects two types of changes: content and structural changes. Content changes include modifications on <b>text,</b> <b>hyperlinks</b> and images. In contrast, structural changes alter the visual appearance of the page and the structure of its blocks. Our Vi-DIFF solution can serve for various applications such as crawl optimization, archive maintenance, web changes browsing, etc. Experiments on Vi-DIFF were conducted and the results are promising...|$|R

5000|$|The anchor text, link label, link text, or link {{title is}} the visible, {{clickable}} <b>text</b> in a <b>hyperlink.</b> The words {{contained in the}} anchor text can determine the ranking that the page will receive by search engines. Since 1998, some web browsers have added the ability to show a tooltip for a hyperlink before it is selected. Not all links have anchor texts because it may be obvious where the link will lead due to {{the context in which}} it is used. Anchor texts normally remain below 60 characters. Different browsers will display anchor texts differently. Usually, web search engines analyze anchor <b>text</b> from <b>hyperlinks</b> on web pages. Other services apply the basic principles of anchor text analysis as well. For instance, academic search engines may use citation context to classify academic articles, and anchor text from documents linked in mind maps may be used too.|$|R

Finally, the background knowledge of the reader can partially determine the effect hyperlinks have on comprehension. In a study of reading comprehension with subjects who were familiar or unfamiliar with art history, <b>texts</b> which were <b>hyperlinked</b> to one another hierarchically were easier for novices to understand than <b>texts</b> which were <b>hyperlinked</b> semantically. In contrast, those already familiar with the topic understood the content equally well with both types of organization.|$|R
