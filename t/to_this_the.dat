5|$|At Federation in 1901 South Australia's defences {{became a}} federal responsibility. Though both {{infantry}} and artillery units were housed {{at the site}} on occasion, by 1903 {{there was no longer}} a permanent military presence at the fort. For most of the 20th century the site was neglected and largely vacated. It did attract some usage though not always of a military nature. During World War I it was partly revived for a former use, with ammunition stored on site. During the same period however the military used it as a detention barracks. Some or all of the fort was leased for private accommodation during the great depression. During the 1930s the magazine was again used, this time to store small arms ammunition. From June 1931 until the beginning of World War II the site housed a Sea Scout detachment, and was used as a district camp-site for the Boy Scouts. The Department of Defence decided in 1937 that much of the equipment and fittings at the fort were surplus to requirements. Consequent <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>the</b> mountings and carriages for the 10inch guns were removed and sold as scrap; though effort was made to scrap the barrels it proved uneconomic and they were left in place. In an unusual turn of events, the fort briefly housed refugees. Twenty-nine islanders from the Maldives were rescued from their sinking dhow by a ship bound for Wallaroo. They stayed at the fort for a week in 1938, before repatriation could be arranged. During World War II the fort again attracted military related use. During 1944 the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield made use of the site to proof ordnance QF 6 pounder anti-tank guns manufactured at General Motors Holden in Woodville. The fort was also used as a residence again, with at least two families reported as living in the under-ground sections during the war.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th century, {{the common}} law courts were {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than {{the common law}} courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} the common law courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the business of the common law courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> <b>the</b> Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited by the fact that the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
