40|$|This paper {{describes}} a tool-clamping/unclamping mechanism for {{application of a}} micro-spindle. The mechanism is based on one-way shape memory effect and interference-fit. The corresponding mathematical models and a few considerable design parameters are mentioned in this paper.

The analysis {{results show that the}} differences between the diametral deformations of the tool holder in high temperature and that in low temperature are increased according to amounts of the interference. Thus the less interference between the tool-holder and the ring, the less tolerance to allow the clamping and unclamping operation because the inner diameter of the tool holder in high temperature should be smaller than the diameter of the <b>tool</b> <b>shank,</b> and that in low temperature should be larger than the diameter of the <b>tool</b> <b>shank.</b> In addition, the design for maximization of clamping force are investigated based on finite element analysis.

40|$|A new three-color {{infrared}} radiation pyrometer using an optical fiber is developed for measuring cutting temperature in high speed machining by small ball end mill. The high speed air spindle unit is adopted to the ordinary milling machine so that the maximum spindle revolution of 40000 rpm is attainable. The ball radius of the carbide cutter is 3 mm and the side cutting of carbon steel with ballnose is executed without cutting fluid. Cutting temperature distribution along the ball-nosed cutting-edge is measured. The influences of spindle rotational speed, radial depth of cut and feed per tooth on the temperature distribution at the flank face are examined. The maximum temperature of peripheral cutting edge about 700 °C is obtained even at the rotation angle of 180 ° after cutting, and it drops along the ballnose toward the ball tip. Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius. Depth of cut and feed per tooth, at the same time, affect the overall temperature at the ball cutting edges. The cooling characteristics in air cutting reveals that the temperature difference during one cycle of intermittent cutting increases as spindle speed decreases. The relationship between the peripheral cutting speed and the tool temperature varies from <b>tool</b> <b>shank</b> to ball tip because the interactions between cutting edge and workpiece change along the ballnose...|$|E

40|$|In {{the turning}} {{operation}} the relative dynamic motion between cutting tool and workpiece, or vibration, {{is a frequent}} problem, which affects {{the result of the}} machining, and, in particular, the surface finish. Tool life is also influenced by vibration. Severe acoustic noise in the working environment frequently occurs as a result of dynamic motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. Dynamic motion between cutting tool and workpiece can be reduced substantially by active control of the machine-tool vibration based on the filtered-x LMS-algorithm. However, in the digital implementation of the filtered-x LMS-algorithm both the inputs and the internal algorithmic quantities are limited to a certain precision. The process of machining a workpiece is also likely to introduce large variations in the level of both input and output signals of the digital controller. The <b>tool</b> <b>shank</b> vibrations can generally be described as a superposition of narrow-band random processes at each modal frequency. Both the variation in signal level and the narrow-band character of the vibration are likely to be unfavorable a fix number realization of the filtered-x LMS-algorithm. The potential large dynamic range in the input signal may introduce coefficient bias and stalling of the convergence of the adaptive FIR filter. Furthermore, both the narrow-band character of the vibration and a large dynamic range in the input signal may result in overflow and thereby seriously degrade the performance of the control system. However, by the use of the leaky filtered-x LMS algorithm problems due to the limited numerical precision such as overflow will be reduced to a large extent...|$|E

The spectrum density function/AErms spectra of both wide band (WD) and resonance (R 15 and R 30) AE sensors were studied. The results demonstrate a very good similarity transfer function in various conditions. Three sets of cutting condition of tool wear monitoring in machining tests were conducted. A <b>tool</b> <b>shank</b> of type SDJCL 1616 H 11 and carbide tool inserts of type CG 4035 DCMT 11 T 3 04 -UF (Sandvik Coromant) were used. Two AE sensors were mounted on the tool-holder: a WD sensor (PAC) {{at the end of}} the tool-holder and an R 30 sensor (PAC) on the side. For valve leakage rate detection, artificial leaks from incomplete closure of ball valve are used to simulate the leakage. The tests were conduced by varying inlet pressure from 1 to 5 bars in three valve sizes of 1, 2 and 3 inches respectively. The AE signals detected at the two sensors (WD and R 15) were analyzed in real-time using a Hewlett Packard HP 89410 A. Transfer functions of two AE sensors are calculated and represented by the ratio of frequency responses of the two sensors. This is particularly useful since the information obtained from one sensor may be converted into another without having to repeat the experiments. With the proposed acoustic transferability, it will be possible to make comparison between results obtained from different set-ups...|$|E
