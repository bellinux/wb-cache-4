5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by <b>Tool</b> and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, <b>Tool</b> had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After <b>Tool</b> filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 <b>Tool</b> agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E

50|$|Agile <b>tooling</b> {{is similar}} to rapid <b>tooling,</b> which uses {{additive}} manufacturing to make <b>tools</b> or <b>tooling</b> quickly, either directly by making parts that serve as the actual <b>tools</b> or <b>tooling</b> components, such as mold inserts; or indirectly by producing patterns that are in turn used in a secondary process to produce the actual <b>tools.</b> Another similar technique is prototype <b>tooling,</b> where molds, dies and other devices are used to produce prototypes. Rapid manufacturing, and specifically rapid <b>tooling</b> technologies, are earlier in their development than rapid prototyping (RP) technologies, and are often extensions of RP.|$|R

5|$|Since <b>tool</b> use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of <b>tool</b> functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., <b>tool</b> orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a <b>tool,</b> but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a <b>tool</b> may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of the <b>tool</b> as it cuts, so {{the form}} {{at the bottom}} of the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile.

One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the <b>tool</b> to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
