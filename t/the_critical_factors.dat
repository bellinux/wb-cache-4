2500|$|Avalanches {{can only}} {{occur in a}} {{standing}} snowpack. Typically winter seasons at high latitudes, high altitudes, or both, have weather that is sufficiently unsettled, and cold enough for precipitated snow to accumulate into a seasonal snowpack. Continentality, through its potentiating influence on the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, {{is an important factor}} in the evolution of instabilities, and consequential occurrence of avalanches. Conversely, proximity to coastal environments moderates the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, and results in a faster stabilization of the snowpack after storm cycles. [...] The evolution of the snowpack is critically sensitive to small variations within the narrow range of meteorological conditions that allow for the accumulation of snow into a snowpack. Among <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> controlling snowpack evolution are: heating by the sun, radiational cooling, vertical temperature gradients in standing snow, snowfall amounts, and snow types. Generally, mild winter weather will promote the settlement and stabilization of the snowpack; and conversely very cold, windy, or hot weather will weaken the snowpack.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the approximation of <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> buckling <b>factor</b> for thin composite plates. A new method to improve the approximation of this <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> is applied based on its behavior with respect to lamination parameters and loading conditions. This method allows accurate approximation of <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> buckling <b>factor</b> for non-orthotropic laminates under complex combined loadings (including shear loading). The influence of the stacking sequence and loading conditions is extensively studied as well as properties of <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> buckling <b>factor</b> behavior (e. g concavity over tensor D or out-of-plane lamination parameters). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> buckling <b>factor</b> is numerically shown to be piecewise linear for orthotropic laminates under combined loading whenever shear remains low and it is also shown to be piecewise continuous in the general case. Based on the numerically observed behavior, a new scheme for the approximation is applied that separates each buckling mode and builds linear, polynomial or rational regressions for each mode. Results of this approach and applications to structural optimization are presented. ...|$|R

Then, <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> of knowledge management which were identified by the first step were ranked using fuzzy quality function deployment in the second step (quantitative phase).
