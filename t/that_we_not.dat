[...] In [...] "It's Not Just the Cops" [...] and [...] "From Ferguson to Staten Island: In Case Anyone Doubted the Public Needs Defending," [...] he argues that public defenders are a necessary component to a comprehensive strategy to realize equal justice that is illusive throughout the criminal justice system. [...] In [...] "The Other Baltimore Story," [...] he makes a similar argument as the nation focused its attention on the killing of Freddy Gray by reminding us of the routine injustice in Baltimore through the story of Ronald Hammond, and the response of public defenders.|$|E

2500|$|Before the museum's opening, about 2,000 {{educators}} {{signed a}} statement {{written by the}} Campaign to Defend the Constitution (DefCon) calling the museum part of a [...] "campaign by the religious right to inject creationist teachings into science education". The National Center for Science Education collected over 800 signatures from scientists in the three states closest to the museum (Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio) on a statement calling the museum's exhibits [...] "scientifically inaccurate materials" [...] and expressing concerns that students who accept its premises as scientifically valid would be [...] "unlikely to succeed in science courses at the college level". Lawrence Krauss, who signed the DefCon statement; Eugenie Scott, executive director of NCSE; and Alan Leshner, {{chief executive officer of}} the American Association for the Advancement of Science, each told the Associated Press (AP) that AiG was within its rights to open the museum, but expressed concerns about its effects on science education. Leshner said, [...] "We're not talking about free speech. We would not protest the museum. However, we are concerned <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> mislead young people inadvertently or intentionally about what science is showing." [...] Krauss has called on media, educators, and government officials to shun the museum and says that its view is based on falsehoods.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} an idolater once asked Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai about the Red Cow, likening its {{procedures}} to witchcraft. Rabban Johanan asked the idolater {{what he had}} seen done for a man possessed by a demon of madness. The idolater explained how in such a case, they would bring roots, make them smoke under the madman, sprinkle water on the man, and the demon would flee. Rabban Johanan told him that the Red Cow dealt similarly with the spirit of uncleanness, as [...] says: [...] "And also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land." [...] Rabban Johanan told him that when they sprinkled the water of purification on the unclean, the spirit of uncleanness fled. But when the idolater had gone, Rabban Johanan's disciples told Rabban Johanan that they saw that he had put off the idolater with a mere makeshift, and asked him what explanation Rabban Johanan would give them. Rabban Johanan told his disciples that the dead did not defile nor the water purify; God had merely laid down a statute, issued a decree, and commanded <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> transgress the decree, as [...] says: [...] "This is the statute of the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NAACP of Portland withdrew {{its support}} of the protest, accusing the {{original}} organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. The group's president said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were [...] "too political". As {{a result of the}} affiliate's criticism, a small group of women from Eastern Oregon who served as the original organizers of the Portland event were replaced with new leaders to [...] " [...] a larger platform to women of color". After the NAACP chapter was made aware of the leadership changes, its president explained: [...] "I felt it was important <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> miss this teachable moment about what role of race and religion and class were playing in pulling this march together." [...] Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: [...] "Putting a black woman's face {{at the beginning of the}} march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support. It's always been the case that if somebody suffers a racist incident, you're just supposed to suck it up and then, for the sake of unity, let's all join hands and pretend it didn't happen.

On that day, also, after our arrival at Lake Wichikagan, and all through the winter, Lumley made a regular practice of assembling the men and reading a sermon from a book which he had brought for the purpose. And he did not neglect instruction of another kind, to which I shall refer as well as to our winter amusements, in the proper place.|$|E

Yet such is the intellectual delinquency of many who most strenuously denounce the system that we have <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> infrequently find the same man advocating in one breath, Socialism, in the next, Anarchism. Indeed, few of these sons of darkness know that even as coherent dreams the two are incompatible. With Anarchy triumphant the Socialist would be a thousand years further from realization of his hope than he is today. Set up Socialism on a Monday and on Tuesday the country would be en fête, gaily hunting down Anarchists. There would be little difficulty in trailing them, for they have not so much sense as a deer, which, running down the wind, sends its tell-tale fragrance on before.|$|E

60|$|That as to {{the people}} who were willing to take service with us, and enter {{themselves}} on board, {{it is true that the}} gunner and some other men offered themselves to us, and we had accepted of them, and we thought it was our part to accept or not to accept of such men as we thought fit. As for what was among themselves, that we had nothing to do with: that, if we had been publicly warned by them not to have entertained any of their men, but with consent of the whole body, then indeed we should have had reason to be cautious; otherwise, we were not in the least concerned about it. That it is true, we refused to let their boats come on board us, being assured that they came in a hostile manner, either to take away the men by force, which had been entered in our service, or perhaps even to seize the ship itself; and why else was the first boat followed by two more, full of men, armed and prepared to attack us? <b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> only came in a friendly manner to them, but resolved to continue in friendship with them, if they thought fit to use us as friends; but that, considering what part of the world we were in, and what their circumstances were, they must allow us to be upon our guard, and not put ourselves in a condition to be used ill.|$|E
60|$|In addition, however, {{to those}} {{attributes}} {{of a mind}} which are grounded on its own states of feeling, attributes may also be ascribed to it, {{in the same manner}} as to a body, grounded on the feelings which it excites in other minds. A mind does not, indeed, like a body, excite sensations, but it may excite thoughts or emotions. The most important example of attributes ascribed on this ground, is the employment of terms expressive of approbation or blame. When, for example, we say of any character, or (in other words) of any mind, that it is admirable, we mean that the contemplation of it excites the sentiment of admiration; and indeed somewhat more, for the word implies <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> only feel admiration, but approve that sentiment in ourselves. In some cases, under the semblance of a single attribute, two are really predicated: one of them, a state of the mind itself; the other, a state with which other minds are affected by thinking of it. As when we say of any one that he is generous. The word generosity expresses a certain state of mind, but being a term of praise, it also expresses that this state of mind excites in us another mental state, called approbation. The assertion made, therefore, is twofold, and of the following purport: Certain feelings form habitually a part of this person’s sentient existence; and the idea of those feelings of his, excites the sentiment of approbation in ourselves or others.|$|E

And here we come to note the second main error of the day, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> only ask our workmen for bad art, but we make them put it into bad substance. We have, for example, put a great quantity of genius, within the last twenty years, into water-colour drawing, and we have done this with the most reckless disregard whether either the colours or the paper will stand. In most instances, neither will. By accident, it may happen that the colours in a given drawing have been of good quality, and its paper uninjured by chemical processes. But you take not the least care to ensure these being so; I have myself seen the most destructive changes take place in water-colour drawings within twenty years after they were painted; and from all I can gather respecting the recklessness of modern paper manufacture, my belief is, that though you may still handle an Albert Dürer engraving, two hundred years old, fearlessly, not one-half of that time will have passed over your modern water-colours, before most of them will be reduced to mere white or brown rags; and your descendants, twitching them contemptuously into fragments between finger and thumb, will mutter against you, half in scorn and half in anger, [...] "Those wretched nineteenth century people! they kept vapouring and fuming about the world, doing what they called business, and they couldn't make a sheet of paper that wasn't rotten." ...|$|E
