But the trend would be expected to be small. If an individual series of observations is generated from simulations that employ a given variance of noise that equals the observed variance of our data series of interest, and a given length (say, 100 points), a large number of such simulated series (say, 100,000 series) can be generated. These 100,000 series can then be analysed individually to calculate estimated trends in each series, and these results establish a distribution of estimated trends that are to be expected from such random data - see diagram. Such a distribution will be normal according to the central limit theorem except in pathological cases. A level of statistical certainty, S, may now be selected - 95% confidence is typical; 99% would be stricter, 90% looser - and the following question can be asked: what is the borderline <b>trend</b> <b>value</b> V that would result in S% of trends being between −V and +V? ...|$|E

However, current methods for monitoring SV require either invasive or non- invasive additional measurements. This study investigates the relationship between SV and Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) to examine whether the value of PWV can capture the changes in SV. The analysis was performed using data from six porcine experiments (N= 6 Pietrain Pigs, 20 - 29 kg) in which left ventricular volume, aortic arc pressure, and descending aortic pressure waveforms were measured simultaneously. From the measured data, correlation coefficients were determined between absolute value of aortic PWV, SV and <b>trend</b> <b>value</b> ‘PWV – mean PWV’, ‘SV – mean SV’ during periods when changes in SV were induced from preload changes, as well as infusion of dobutamine. The results showed good correlation (r = 0. 59) for <b>trend</b> <b>value,</b> however, the correlation coefficient were poor with r = 0. 028 for absolute value across all pigs.

The {{spatial distribution of}} the annual mean AOD was generally characterized by two prominent high-value centers located in the industrially and economically developed areas of the North China Plain and East China, and the dust aerosol-dominated areas of southern Xinjiang. The seasonally averaged AOD reached its maximum in spring (0. 430 ± 0. 049), followed by summer (0. 356 ± 0. 035) and winter (0. 282 ± 0. 039), with the minimum occurring in autumn (0. 219 ± 0. 022). There were notable long-term annual trends in AOD in different regions over North China during 2001 – 2016 : a decreasing AOD trend was found in Qinghai Tibet (− 0. 015 ± 0. 010 /decade), Northwest China (− 0. 059 ± 0. 013 /decade at 99 % confidence level), and the North China Plain (− 0. 007 ± 0. 021 /decade), but a positive increasing trend was identified in northern Xinjiang (0. 01 ± 0. 006 /decade), southern Xinjiang (0. 002 ± 0. 013 /decade), East China (0. 053 ± 0. 042 /decade), and Northeast China (0. 016 ± 0. 029 /decade). Seasonal patterns in the AOD regional long-term trend were evident. The AODs in spring over all the study regions, except East China, exhibited a decreasing trend, with the maximum <b>trend</b> <b>value</b> observed in Northwest China (− 0. 099 ± 0. 029 /decade at 99 % confidence level); whereas AODs in autumn, except in Northwest China, showed an increasing trend, with the maximum <b>trend</b> <b>value</b> occurring in East China (0. 073 ± 0. 038 /decade). Geographically, we also examined the annual and seasonal spatial patterns of AOD trends over North China. The annual spatial trends in AOD revealed a dominance of positive trends in most regions over the whole of North China from 2001 to 2016, but especially in East and Northeast China (AOD <b>trend</b> <b>value</b> of about 0. 16 /decade); whereas a negative trend was observed over northern Inner Mongolia (AOD <b>trend</b> <b>value</b> of about − 0. 12 /decade).

40|$|International audienceOn {{the basis}} of {{previous}} works, we choose to focus here on a fuzzy processing of both the declaration of the objective and the performance expression. The new idea developed in this study consists of handling a " trend " objective declaration, based on linguistic declarations of trends and Zadeh's precisiation concept, and then to analyse {{the impact of this}} on the performance expression. Indeed, knowing that an objective is declared by a target value and a temporal horizon, such a value can be more or less precise, declared {{in the form of a}} single final value or a <b>trend</b> <b>value,</b> throughout the temporal horizon. Moreover, the temporal horizon can be explicitly described by a numerical interval or only by its boundary. Given that the performance expression is defined as the achievement degree of the objective, such an expression can be enriched, in the case where the objective is declared by a <b>trend</b> <b>value,</b> by an expression that gives information about the trend of the objective achievement. Instantaneous and trend performances are thus jointed, leading in this sense to the handling of the temporal aspect that is inherent to the achievement of the objective and that suggests the trend performance expression. Throughout the study, the propositions are illustrated via a ratio rate objective...|$|E

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{structural}} divergence in the Euro Area is examined {{on the basis}} of the frequency and distribution of observed asymmetric shocks over the period 1996 – 2015. An asymmetric shock is defined as an opposite sign difference between the deviation of an individual country’s GDP growth rate from a trend and the deviation of the EA-wide GDP growth rate from a trend. Two measures of asymmetric shocks are introduced, one based on exponential <b>trend</b> <b>values</b> and another on moving-average <b>trend</b> <b>values.</b> Geographical distribution of observed (“revealed”) shocks shows that EA member countries differ in terms of structural convergence, with a higher number of asymmetric shocks in countries that joined the EA at a later date. The distribution of asymmetric shocks over time shows two peaks in the number of shocks around 2002 and 2011, but no clear tendency towards more divergence is detected. As actual data may not provide a full picture of asymmetric shocks (given that countries with sufficient fiscal space could have neutralized their negative impact on GDP growth rates) a hypothesis on the existence of “non-revealed” negative asymmetric shocks is examined. Testing for correlation between public debt levels and GDP growth rate deviations confirms the existence of “non-revealed” asymmetric shocks in low-debt countries. In general, the observed differences in the number of asymmetric shocks in EA member countries (and their increases over time) may actually reflect different fiscal policy reactions in individual countries as well as the impact of financial and debt crises, and are not necessarily an indication of widening structural divergence across the EA...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to acquire information about consistency of ZTD (zenith total delay) linear trends and seasonal components between two consecutive GPS reprocessing campaigns. The analysis concerned two sets of the ZTD time series which were estimated during EUREF (Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe) EPN (Permanent Network) reprocessing campaigns according to 2008 and 2015 MUT AC (Military University of Technology Analysis Centre) scenarios. Firstly, Lomb–Scargle periodograms were generated for 57 EPN stations to obtain a characterisation of oscillations occurring in the ZTD time series. Then, the values of seasonal components and linear trends were estimated using the LSE (least squares estimation) approach. The Mann–Kendall trend test was also carried out to verify the presence of linear long-term ZTD changes. Finally, differences in seasonal signals and linear trends between these two data sets were investigated. All these analyses were conducted for the ZTD time series of two lengths: a shortened 16 -year series and a full 18 -year one. In the case of spectral analysis, amplitudes of the annual and semi-annual periods were almost exactly the same for both reprocessing campaigns. Exceptions were found for only a few stations and they did not exceed 1  mm. The estimated trends were also similar. However, for the reprocessing performed in 2008, the <b>trends</b> <b>values</b> were usually higher.
