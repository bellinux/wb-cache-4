They led youth worship at their school and church, and began writing their own music that year. Drummer Mark Graalman and bassist Matt Kollar soon joined, forming the band's original line-up.

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
500|$|As the war {{drew to a}} {{close in}} April 1865, Greeley and the Tribune urged magnanimity towards the {{defeated}} Confederates, arguing that making martyrs of Confederate leaders would only inspire future rebels. <b>This</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> moderation ceased when Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Many concluded that Lincoln had fallen {{as the result of a}} final rebel plot, and the new president, Andrew Johnson, offered $100,000 for the capture of fugitive Confederate president Jefferson Davis. After the rebel leader was caught, Greeley initially advocated that [...] "punishment be meted out in accord with a just verdict".|$|E

2500|$|Following the BBC's {{decision}} not to renew Clarkson's contract with the show on 25 March 2015, Hammond's contract expired on 31 March. In April he ruled {{out the possibility of}} continuing to present Top Gear, commenting via Twitter that [...] "amidst all <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> us 'quitting' or not: there's nothing for me to 'quit' not about to quit my mates anyway". On 12 June 2015 the BBC confirmed that Top Gear will return with a 75-minute special, combining two unseen challenges featuring all three presenters from series 22, with studio links from Hammond and May. It aired in the UK on BBC Two on 28 June at 8 p.m, and in the United States on BBC America on 13 July at 9 p.m.|$|E

In [...] "The Poison Sky" [...] she cites her relationship with Thomas Milligan as a reason to stay on Earth, rather than join Donna and Doctor in the TARDIS - saying that she's now got a great big adventure of her own to enjoy. Agyeman feels that Martha's relationship with Tom has [...] "helped cement where she is in life". Agyeman also feels that it was important for Martha's mother Francine to re-appear in [...] "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", as closure for what happened to the Jones family in Series Three: [...] "It's great for the audience to know that all <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> Martha wanting to stay on earth because of her family is for real. It's great to see Adjoa there, representing the Jones clan, even though it's a fleeting appearance. She's still very much in Martha's life".|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E

2500|$|In a 12 May 2013 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Kasparov {{questioned}} {{reports that}} the Russian security agency, the FSB, had fully cooperated with the FBI {{in the matter of}} the Boston bombers. He noted that the elder bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had reportedly met in Russia with two known jihadists who [...] "were killed in Dagestan by the Russian military just days before Tamerlan left Russia for the U.S." [...] Kasparov argued, [...] "If no intelligence was sent from Moscow to Washington" [...] about this meeting, [...] "all <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> FSB cooperation cannot be taken seriously." [...] He further observed, [...] "This would not be the first time Russian security forces seemed strangely impotent {{in the face of an}} impending terror attack," [...] pointing out that in both the 2002 Moscow theater siege and the 2004 Beslan school attack, [...] "there were FSB informants in both terror groups—yet the attacks went ahead unimpeded." [...] Given this history, he wrote, [...] "it is impossible to overlook that the Boston bombing took place just days after the U.S. Magnitsky List was published, creating the first serious external threat to the Putin power structure by penalizing Russian officials complicit in human-rights crimes." [...] In sum, Putin's [...] "dubious record on counterterrorism and its continued support of terror sponsors Iran and Syria mean only one thing: common ground zero." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2006, the Stedelijk Museum and the University of Amsterdam held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the {{introduction}} to <b>this</b> <b>talked</b> <b>of</b> the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as authenticity, self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
