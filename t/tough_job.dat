5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{thousands}} of boys {{were employed in}} glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133°F). When the boys are at work, {{they are exposed to}} this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00pm to 3:00am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.|$|E

500|$|Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 {{as a full}} {{feature for}} Danny Trejo.

500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> to do, bless it, but getting it {{to do what you want}} is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E

The problem, he argues, with this use is that there is [...] "no basis for inferring national versus regional focus, because it’s not a factor in the classification criteria. So it should come as no surprise that the national and regional lists contain a great many inconsistencies and bizarre placements [...] By continuing to rely on the Carnegie Classification, they avoid the <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> of defining their terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2012, a storyline {{involving}} Lola Pearce, {{forced to}} hand over her baby Lexi Pearce, was criticised by the charity The Who Cares?

The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC [...] "too lazy and arrogant" [...] to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken [...] "without sufficient grounds to do so". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked [...] "real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs [...]. EastEnders shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> even tougher." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Rodríguez, {{the origins}} of the film go back to Desperado. He says, [...] "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature." [...] In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in Desperado. [...] "So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000.

2500|$|On September 26, 2005, Raymond Kelly (New York City Police Commissioner) and Patrick Lynch (president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York) {{called for}} a boycott of the game, citing its {{depiction}} of law-breaking police officers as damaging and offensive. In {{an interview with the}} New York Daily News, Kelly stated [...] "It's an outrage. I think it disrespects all police offers." [...] Although the game was made in conjunction with two former NYPD detectives, Bill Clarke and Tom Walker (author of Fort Apache: The Bronx), and although the police force in the game is called the PDNY (as opposed to the real life NYPD), Kelly stated [...] "It's totally inappropriate. It's a <b>tough</b> <b>job,</b> a dangerous job, and this undermines what police officers try to do. I'm saddened that some former members of the department are linked to that video game." [...] Lynch said of Clarke, [...] "The cop who worked on this video should look in the mirror. He makes it harder for everyone working the job." [...] Clark responded by commenting that police unions [...] "should stop worrying about video games and spend more time getting cops more than a $25,000 starting salary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Planet Terror is {{preceded by}} a fake trailer for a film titled Machete, {{starring}} Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin, as it had during the original [...] "double feature" [...] presentation of Grindhouse.
