50|$|An {{example of}} the {{importance}} of the field to postharvest handling is the discovery that ripening of fruit can be delayed, and thus their storage prolonged, by preventing fruit <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration.</b> This insight allowed scientists to bring to bear their knowledge of the fundamental principles and mechanisms of respiration, leading to postharvest storage techniques such as cold storage, gaseous storage, and waxy skin coatings.

The mitochondrion is the major target of intracellular oxidative stress associated with aggressive factors like H. pylori, alcohol and NSAIDs, which disturb the energy metabolism of mitochondria. Troxipide accelerates oxygen intake of marginal gastric mucosa and glycogen consumptive stimulation of the gastric mucosa of the corpus, thereby elevating the <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> and energy metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and <b>tissues.</b> <b>Respiration</b> is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|R

He moved the equipment to a small warehouse in Harvard Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he built research apparatus for professors and researchers of Boston-area medical schools, and produced many inventions over the following years. In 1928, he designed a Barcroft-Warburg apparatus for <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> studies. In 1930, he designed {{a new type of}} micromanipulator which was valuable in early physiology studies and later saw use in assembly of electronic components.

40|$|The {{glycolysis}} and <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> in {{the specimen}} {{of the brain}} of chronic cerebral local anaphylactic rabbits showed rather lower value than those in normal group. But the glutamic acid, when added to the specimen accelerated the glycolysis and <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> so, that they showed no significant difference from those in normal group. From these facts, it is considered that in the brain of chronic cerebral local anaphylactic rabbits gltamic substances are decresed or short. But supply of glutamic acid could not make better the mean value than normal.

5000|$|Alcoholic {{fermentation}} {{is often}} used by plants in anaerobic conditions to produce ATP and regenerate NAD+ to allow for glycolysis to continue. For most plant tissues, fermentation only occurs in anaerobic conditions, {{but there are a}} few exceptions. In the pollen of maize (Zea mays) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum & Nicotiana plumbaginifolia), the fermentation enzyme ADH is abundant, regardless of the oxygen level. In tobacco pollen, PDC is also highly expressed in this tissue and transcript levels are not influenced by oxygen concentration. Tobacco pollen, similar to Crabtree-positive yeast, perform high levels of fermentation dependent on the sugar supply, and not oxygen availability. In these <b>tissues,</b> <b>respiration</b> and alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously with high sugar availability. [...] Fermentation produces the toxic acetaldehyde and ethanol, that can build up in large quantities during pollen development. It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes cytoplasmic male sterility. Cytoplasmic male sterility is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen. It is believed that this trait might be due to the expression of the fermentation genes, ADH and PDC, a lot earlier on in pollen development than normal and the accumulation of toxic aldehyde.|$|R

30|$|The biomass {{of plant}} organs is {{determined}} by the allocation of photosynthetic products when adapted to N deposition. Nitrogen deposition influences the allocation of photosynthetic products between ephemeral and long-lived <b>tissues,</b> <b>respiration</b> and biomass production, and above- and below-ground components (Litton et al. 2007), as well as the allocation and amount of photosynthates to plant organs (Yang et al. 2012). Analysis of the above- to below-ground biomass ratio has led many researchers to conclude that the effects of N on C distribution in different plant organs generally support the functional equilibrium hypothesis (that is, when plant growth is restricted by a certain resource, plants will preferentially allocate photosynthetic products to the organ that absorbs the resource) (Gower et al. 1992; Albaugh et al. 1998; Tateno et al. 2004). However, other researchers believe that the source-sink relationship hypothesis better describes the effect of N on C distribution in various plant organs (Dewar 1993). This hypothesis holds that the plant is a system that consists of interactions between sources and leaves, sinks and stems, and roots and fruit. The sources provide the required assimilates through phloem transport, and the sinks obtain the assimilates by competition with other sink organs. However, how changes in biomass among different organs—such as between leaves and branches, roots and leaves, and thick and fine roots—conform to the various hypotheses is unclear.|$|R

50|$|In <b>tissue,</b> {{cellular}} <b>respiration</b> produces {{carbon dioxide}} as a waste product; {{as one of}} the primary roles of the cardiovascular system, most of this CO2 is rapidly removed from the tissues by its hydration to bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate ion present in the blood plasma is transported to the lungs, where it is dehydrated back into CO2 and released during exhalation. These hydration and dehydration conversions of CO2 and H2CO3, which are normally very slow, are facilitated by carbonic anhydrase in both the blood and duodenum. While in the blood, bicarbonate ion serves to neutralize acid introduced to the blood through other metabolic processes (e.g. lactic acid, ketone bodies); likewise, any bases (e.g. urea from the catabolism of proteins) are neutralized by carbonic acid.|$|R

30|$|Hyperglycemia was {{associated}} with significantly lower mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and maximal O 2 consumption in the uncoupled state. Controlling glycemia restored mitochondrial capacity, and EMD 008 further enhanced this effect. Our findings of a hyperglycemia-induced depression of mitochondrial capacity extends previous reports on <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> by Vanhorebeek in a long-term, un-resuscitated rabbit model of burn injury-induced critical illness [7, 8], inasmuch as hyperglycemia has similar effects during the acute phase of noradrenaline-resuscitated murine septic shock. At a first glance, increased <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> could be induced by the noradrenaline intervention alone as reported by other authors for liver mitochondrial respiration during long-term porcine endotoxemia [38]. These authors, however, compared noradrenaline treatment to fluid resuscitation alone, whereas in our experiment, all mice received continuous i.v. noradrenaline to achieve target hemodynamics. Furthermore, we explicitly studied the effect of hyperglycemia in comparison to normoglycemia, while glycemia was maintained between 63 and 108 mgmol[*]·[*]dL- 1 in that study.|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} stated {{previously}} that the gaseous metabolism of animal increases {{to a certain}} extent through the administration of oxidizable substances. Then the present investigation was carried out to decide whether the oxidizable substance has any intensifying effect upon the respiration of tissue aud if so, to observe how to intensify it. Measuring the methylen blue-de-colourisation time of frog's muscle by Thunberg-Ahlgren's method, it is shortend most remarkably when fresh lotus rhizome juice or lemon juice was administered but only a little in the case of tea-extract or 6 % glucose liquid. Lotus rhizome juice oxidized with air has no effect. In short the <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> seems to be intensified in proportion to the oxidizable substance administered.

Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|R
40|$|Rat aging from 4 to 12 mo was {{accompanied}} by hippocampus and frontal cortex mitochondrial dysfunction, with decreases of 23 to 53 % in <b>tissue</b> and mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> and {{in the activities of}} complexes I and IV and of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) (P < 0. 02). In aged rats, the two brain areas showed mitochondria with higher content (35 – 78 %) of oxidation products of phospholipids and proteins and with higher (59 – 95 %) rates of O 2 − and H 2 O 2 production (P < 0. 02). Dietary supplementation with vitamin E (2. 0 or 5. 0 g/kg of food) from 9 to 12 mo of rat age, restored in a dose-dependent manner, the decreases in <b>tissue</b> and mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> (to 90 – 96 %) and complexes I and IV and mtNOS activities (to 86 – 88 %) of the values of 4 -mo-old rats (P < 0. 02). Vitamin E prevented, by 73 – 80 %, the increases in oxidation products, and by 62 – 68 %, the increases in O 2 − and H 2 O 2 production (P < 0. 05). High resolution histochemistry of cytochrome oxidase in the hippocampal CA 1 region showed higher staining in vitamin E-treated rats than in control animals. Aging decreased (19 %) hippocampus mitochondrial mass, an effect that was restored by vitamin E. High doses of vitamin E seem to sustain mitochondrial biogenesis in synaptic areas...|$|R
30|$|The results {{indicate}} that the respiration rate of logs increased as a function of temperature following Arrhenius' equation, with activation energy (Ea) value of 27708 J mol− 1. The respiration rate at a reference temperature of 20 °C decreased from 25.1 mg CO 2 kg DW− 1 h− 1 one week after harvest to 16.2 and 11.5 mg CO 2 kg DW− 1 h− 1 three and six weeks after harvest, respectively. The dominant <b>respiration</b> <b>tissue</b> shifted from cambial and parenchymatous tissues in ‘fresh’ logs towards the internal sapwood over a six-week period. This shift may be attributed to severe dehydration of the outer layers. Microbial activity also contributed to the respiration of logs when stored at humid conditions.|$|R
40|$|During an {{investigation}} of the effect of the carcinoclastic compound, podophyllotoxin, on <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration,</b> we observed that injection of this compound into normal rats produced marked reduction of the respiration of spleen, lymph node, and thymus gland slices (1). Lymphatic tissue appeared to be particularly sensitive to podophyllotoxin, in sharp contrast to liver and kidney, which were not inhibited. This selective inhibition was dearly demonstrable only when the compound was injected into animals. The reduction of lymphatic <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> when podophyllotoxin was added in vitro was not strikingly different from that of liver or kidney (2). In order to determine whether this effect on lymphatic tissue is a unique property of podophyllotoxin or is common to other carcinoclastic agents, we have compared the activity of podophyllotoxin in this respect with three compounds of widely differing chemical structure, which have, nevertheless, the common property of inhibiting the growth of certain types of tumors. In this paper we present the results of experiments in which colchicine, urethane, and one of the nitrogen mustards, methyl-bis(fl-chloroethyl) amine, have been compared with podophyllotoxin. These three compounds were chosen because, like podophyllotoxin, (1) they possess carcinoclastic properties; (2) they inhibit cell mitosis; (3) they depress hematopoietic activity (4 - 20). Moreover, they have the common property of provoking what Dustin (21) has called the "crise caryoclasique, " the crisis of nuclear fragmentation, in the lymphoid system and thymus. Published work on the effect of the compounds on <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration</b> is rather meager.

40|$|Endothelial {{nitric oxide}} (nitrogen monoxide) is {{synthesized}} at the intravascular/extravascular interface. We previously have reported the intravascular half-life of NO, {{as a result}} of consumption by erythrocytes, as approximately 2 ms. We report here studies designed to estimate the lifetime of NO in the parenchymal (extravascular) tissue and describe the implications of these results for the distribution of NO and oxygen concentration gradients away from the blood vessel. The rate of consumption of NO by parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) linearly depends on both NO and O 2 concentration. We estimate that the extravascular half-life of NO will range from 0. 09 to > 2 s, depending on O 2 concentration and thus distance from the vessel. Computer modeling reveals that this phenomenon, coupled with reversible NO inhibition of cellular mitochondrial oxygen consumption, substantially extends the zone of adequate tissue cellular oxygenation away from the blood vessel, with an especially dramatic effect during conditions of increased tissue work (oxygen consumption). This represents a second action of NO, in addition to vasodilation, in enhancing <b>tissue</b> cellular <b>respiration</b> and provides a possible physiological function for the known reversible inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by low concentrations of NO...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on respiration of mitochondria and tissue segments from three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and one rye (Secale cereale L.) cultivar grown at 2 and 24 C has been examined. Discontinuities in Arrhenius plots of respiratory activity against temperature were observed for mitochondria and tissue segments from seedlings grown at both temperatures. The rates of respiration decreased abruptly below the transition temperatures, resulting in increased energy of activation values for respiration. Transition temperatures were observed from 6 to 10 C during <b>tissue</b> segment <b>respiration,</b> and from 10 to 14 C during respiration by isolated mitochondria.

Substances from calcified egg yolk enhanced only protein secretion and inhibited <b>tissue</b> <b>respiration,</b> incorporation of radioactive valine into magnum pro-teins, and 14 C 02 formation. Aspartic-glutamic transaminase activity was not affected by experimental treatment. Individual values depend on the functional state of the oviduct.

Nematode stress dosage, measured {{as the product of}} cumulative number of juveniles and females and their total energy (calories) demand, accounted for up to 15 and 10 % of the energy assimilated by French Colombard and Thompson Seedless plants, respectively. Total leaf area, total carbon dioxide fixed, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and internal leaf CO₂ concentration were not affected, but energy assimilated into plant <b>tissue</b> and <b>respiration</b> were decreased by nematode infection in both cultivars. Energy consumed by nematodes accounted for most of the difference in total energy assimilated between infected and uninfected plants on French Colombard but not on Thompson Seedless, suggesting that the resistant cultivar may be using more energy to curtail the nematode's activity. Nematodes did not affect the concentration of reducing sugars, but the concentration of nonreducing sugars increased in French Colombard and decreased in Thompson Seedless. This indicates that there was more translocation of photosynthate to the feeding sites of the susceptible than to those of the resistant cultivar, and may explain why M. incognita causes more damage to French Colombard than to Thompson Seedless...|$|R
