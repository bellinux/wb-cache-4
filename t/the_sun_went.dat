25|$|The Sun has {{qualified}} for the WNBA Playoffs in eight of its fourteen years in Connecticut. The Sun has featured such notable players as the late 7-foot-2 Margo Dydek, Indiana native Katie Douglas, veteran sharpshooter Kara Lawson, University of Connecticut icons Asjha Jones and Nykesha Sales, 2008 MVP runner-up point guard Lindsay Whalen and 2012 MVP recipient Tina Charles. In 2004 and 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>went</b> to the WNBA Finals but fell short to Seattle and Sacramento, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Official {{orders were}} passed to Hoge {{to seize the}} bridge. By dusk, the combat {{engineers}} had partially filled the crater in the approach ramp with a tank dozer and once <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>went</b> down, used the darkness to begin hasty repairs of the bridge. Until midnight of 7 March, the east bank was secured by only about 120 troops from Company A, 27th Armored Infantry Battalion and 1st Platoon, Company B, 9th Armored Infantry Battalion. If the Germans had mounted an effective counterattack against this small force, they might have prevented the Americans from establishing the bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to these}} predictions, the Sun started {{the season with}} an {{outstanding}} 8–1 record. Soon, however, the team found itself in a disappointing slump. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>went</b> on a five-game losing streak, the worst ever for a team under Mike Thibault. The team finished the regular season with a 21–13 record which placed them second in the Eastern Conference, only one game out of first place. In the playoffs, the Sun's youth and inexperience caught up to them; the New York Liberty won game three on the Sun's home floor and {{for the second straight}} year, the Sun failed to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E

500|$|A dynamo can amplify a {{magnetic}} field, {{but it needs}} a [...] "seed" [...] field to get it started. For the Earth, {{this could have been}} an external magnetic field. Early in its history <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>went</b> through a T-Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had {{a magnetic}} field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind. However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias {{that are part of the}} boundary conditions for the geodynamo.|$|E
2500|$|The tour, Cohen's {{first in}} 15 years, began May 11 in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and was {{extended}} until late 2010. The schedule {{of the first}} leg in mid-2008 encompassed Canada and Europe, including performances at The Big Chill, the Montreal Jazz Festival, and on the Pyramid Stage at the 2008 Glastonbury Festival on June 29, 2008. His performance at Glastonbury was hailed {{by many as the}} highlight of the festival, and his performance of [...] "Hallelujah" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>went</b> down received a rapturous reception and a lengthy ovation from a packed Pyramid Stage field. He also played two shows in London's O2 Arena.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, Acuff {{tried out}} for the Knoxville Smokies, a minor-league {{baseball}} team then affiliated with the New York (now San Francisco) Giants. A series of collapses in spring training following a sunstroke, however, ended his baseball career. The effects left him ill for several years, and he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1930. [...] "I couldn't stand any sunshine at all," [...] he later recalled. While recovering, Acuff began to hone his fiddle skills, often playing on the family's front porch after <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>went</b> down. His father gave him several records of regionally renowned fiddlers, such as Fiddlin' John Carson and Gid Tanner, which were important influences on his early style.|$|E

2500|$|Andersen enjoyed {{performing}} {{before an}} audience and promoted many of his tales by reading them aloud at social gatherings. [...] In the 1840s, the composer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was present at such a reading in Germany and reported he was so elated and excited by the performance that he couldn't wait to thank Andersen but [...] "jubilantly flew" [...] at the poet exclaiming: [...] "But you are a marvelous reader; no one reads fairy tales like you!" [...] Many years later in the 1870s, the English author and critic Edmund Gosse had a similar perception and noted, [...] "As soon as he spoke, yes, if he merely smiled, he genius was evident ... And as he read, everything I was looking atthe dazzling sails, the sea, the coast of Sweden, the bright skywas set ablaze as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>went</b> down. It was as if nature itself were blushing with delight {{at the sound of}} Hans Christian Andersen's voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of Saturday, 10 March, the 394th Infantry Regiment of the 99th Infantry Division were given the job of {{relieving}} the 9th Infantry Division on the east bank of the Rhine after they captured Linz am Rhein. They were trucked from Meckenheim, [...] to the northeast, into Remagen along roads jammed with hundreds of jeeps, trucks, ambulances, and tanks. Driving {{on both sides of}} the road, the trucks crawled past tanks burning by the side of the road and dead bodies everywhere. Trucks struck by artillery were just pushed to the side with dead GIs still inside them. As <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>went</b> down, the 394th IR/99 ID emerged from the woods on the ridge overlooking the town and could see that the bridge was being shelled by artillery. They hiked the last [...] and as they moved spasmodically through Remagen, the streets were lit by burning buildings and vehicles. One street was marked by a sign: [...] "This street subject to enemy shell fire," [...] and dead GIs proved it was true. Artillery shells struck the western shore of the Rhine at the rate of one every 30 seconds that night.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project had}} a long and {{difficult}} gestation— {{while it was still}} being built, original owner Kenneth Reiner (with whom Lautner collaborated closely) was bankrupted by the fraudulent dealings of his business partners and he was forced to sell the house. Lautner also faced opposition from the Los Angeles building certification authorities, who were dismayed by the radical design of the post-stressed concrete ramp, which cantilivers out {{from the base of the}} house without any columns supporting it from beneath, and is only four inches thick. Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles building inspector demanded a static load test to prove that it could take the weight of a car— a standoff that mirrored Lautner and Wright's earlier contretemps with skeptical building authorities who demanded load tests on Wright's famous [...] "lotus pad" [...] columns for the Johnson Wax Building. In the event, Lautner's load calculations proved flawless and in fact the instruments recorded more deflection in the concrete from the change in temperature when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>went</b> down than they did from the weight of the sandbags loaded onto the ramp to test it. The project then sat unfinished for some time. When it became available through bankruptcy in 1974, Philip and Jacklyn Burchill bought the home. They worked with Lautner to complete the home and moved in 1976.|$|E
