5|$|A {{number of}} royal castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an {{essential}} network of royal storehouses in the 13th century {{for a wide}} range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials.

Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> some of the worst abuses.|$|E
