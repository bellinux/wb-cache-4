5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast {{to avoid making}} landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, although it was expected to pass within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend. On September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. The trough caused the hurricane <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours. During that time, the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished, and concurrently, the winds decreased as the convection diminished.|$|E

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} forming, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Fernanda. Banding features increased, and outflow became well-established throughout the storm. Fernanda intensified further and attained hurricane status late on August 10. Soon after, a large eye became evident on satellite imagery, which became more distinct and organized. The hurricane subsequently underwent rapid intensification, and by August 12, Fernanda reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h); at that time, {{it was a}} Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and was located about 1070 miles (1725km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The peak winds were based on estimates from the Dvorak technique. After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend. By August 14, the eye had become less distinct as the storm moved over cooler waters, while winds decreased to below major hurricane status, or Category 3 intensity. At that time, the NHC forecast Fernanda <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> and turn to the northwest, although the possibility of a more westward track toward Hawaii was noted.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we discuss the}} {{possibility}} of positive-acceleration regimes, and their transition <b>to</b> <b>decelerated</b> regimes, in two-dimensional (2 D) cosmological models. We use general relativity and the thermodynamics in a 2 D space-time, where the gas {{is seen as the}} sources of the gravitational field. An early-Universe model is analyzed where the state equation of van der Waals is used, replacing the usual barotropic equation. We show that this substitution permits the simulation of a period of inflation, followed by a negative-acceleration era. The dynamical behavior of the system follows from the solution of the Jackiw-Teitelboim equations (JT equations) and the energy-momentum conservation laws. In a second stage we focus the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger model (CGHS model); here the transition from the inflationary period <b>to</b> the <b>decelerated</b> period is also present between the solutions, although this result depend strongly on the initial conditions used for the dilaton field. The temporal evolution of the cosmic scale function, its acceleration, the energy density and the hydrostatic pressure are the physical quantities obtained in through the analysis.

25|$|Insects gain kinetic energy, {{provided}} by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> {{toward the end of}} the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the downstroke, the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain a pad of elastic, rubber-like protein called resilin. During the upstroke of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the downstroke.|$|E

25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E

25|$|A light sail or {{magnetic}} sail {{powered by}} a massive laser or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own reaction mass and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's payload. Robert L. Forward proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array {{to be present in}} that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed {{to the rear of the}} spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload. In 2002, Geoffrey A. Landis of NASA's Glen Research center also proposed a laser-powered, propulsion, sail ship that would host a diamond sail (of a few nanometers thick) powered with the use of solar energy. With this proposal, this interstellar ship would, theoretically, be able to reach 10 percent the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|Project Orion {{team member}} Freeman Dyson {{proposed}} in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure deuterium fusion detonations {{with a very}} high fuel-burnup fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000km/s delta-v allowing a flight-time to Alpha Centauri of 130 years. Later studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear unit powered Orion starship, assuming no fuel is saved for slowing back down, is about 8% to 10% {{of the speed of}} light (0.08-0.1c). An atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 3%-5% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a magnetic sail <b>to</b> <b>decelerate</b> the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity. Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include Project Longshot, Project Daedalus, and Mini-Mag Orion.
