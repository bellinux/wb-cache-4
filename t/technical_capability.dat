25|$|Having {{witnessed}} {{the power of}} German tanks in the Spanish Civil War, he designed the 37 mm Gun M3, a light but powerful anti-tank gun. Barnes was promoted to brigadier general in October 1940, and major general in March 1943. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the research, development and standardization of 1,600 different weapons. Around $50 billion was spent on them. Barnes sought to develop medium and heavy tanks, but was stymied by the <b>technical</b> <b>capability</b> of American industry at the time, particularly its inability to develop a sufficiently powerful engine. He pressed, without success, for diesel engines, and for the adoption of the M6 heavy tank.|$|E

Although it is advised for parents to name their children so that others are able to easily read their names, there are no restrictions on the complexity of Chinese characters used, provided that there are no technical issues in doing so (see below). The use of Simplified characters is advised over Traditional Chinese characters; however, this is not strictly enforced.|$|E

This effort was the start on the path that led to the famous Tizard Mission in late August 1940. Ironically, by the time the Mission was being planned, the Norden had been removed from the list of items to be discussed, and Roosevelt personally noted this was due largely to political reasons. Ultimately, although Tizard was unable to convince the US to release the design, he was able to request information about its external dimensions and details on the mounting system so it could be easily added to British bombers if it were released in the future.|$|E
40|$|Current theory lacks clarity on how {{different}} kinds of resources contribute to new product advantage, or how firms can combine different resources to achieve a new product advantage. While several studies have identified different firm-specific resources that influence new product advantage, comparatively little research has explored the contribution of strategic supplier resources. Combining resource-based and relational perspectives, this study develops a theoretical model investigating how a strategic supplier's <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities</b> impact focal firm new product advantage and how firms combine different resources to gain this advantage. The model is tested using detailed survey data collected from 153 interorganizational new product development projects in the United Kingdom within which a strategic supplier had been extensively involved. Empirical results support our research hypotheses. First, supplier technical performance is shown {{to have a significant}} positive impact on new product advantage. Next, we show that while supplier <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities</b> have a positive influence on supplier technical performance, the a priori nature of the supplier's task moderates the relationship. Finally, our data support our hypotheses related to the positive relationship between relationship-specific absorptive capacity and new product advantage, and the proposed negative moderation of supplier <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities</b> on this relationship. Based upon these findings, we encourage managers to recognize that strategic suppliers' with greater <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities</b> perform better regardless of the degree of creativity required by their task; but that strategic suppliers with lower <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities</b> may partially compensate (substitute) for their lack of <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities,</b> if they are able to respond to high problem-solving task requirements. Furthermore, we suggest that the firm's development of relationship-specific absorptive capacity is much more important when a strategic supplier is less technically capable. A buying firm's relationship-specific absorptive capacity can, according to our data, substitute for low supplier <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities.</b> On the other hand, where the supplier has strong <b>technical</b> <b>capabilities,</b> investments in relationship-specific absorptive capacity have no effect on new product advantage. Our findings reinforce recent calls for research on how firms can combine different resources and capabilities to achieve superior performance. This is the author accepted manuscript.

25|$|On January 7, all Russian {{gas flow}} through Ukraine was halted, {{completely}} cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, {{much of which}} is completely reliant on Russian gas, and partially {{to other parts of}} Europe. Miller stated that Gazprom had stopped all gas deliveries to Ukraine because Ukraine had closed the system down, but Naftogaz said it closed down the system because Gazprom had stopped delivering gas. According to an official statement by Gazprom, Ukraine was sabotaging the transit of gas to European countries and had practically declared a gas blockade of Europe. Prime Minister Putin accused Ukraine of blackmail, referring back to the letter Naftogaz sent to Gazprom on December 30 which threatened to confiscate European bound gas if no contract was in place. Ukraine denied the charges and blamed Russia for stopping gas deliveries to Europe. According to the Ukrainian presidential envoy for international energy security, Bohdan Sokolovsky, Ukraine had no <b>technical</b> <b>capability</b> to stop the pumping of Russian gas into its territory. He claimed that all pumping stations through which gas is supplied to Ukraine are located in Russia.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Abkhazia {{reported}} that around 10 am of that day, it had shot down another spy plane over {{the village of}} Gagida in Gali district. Georgian television station Mze TV {{reported that}} this had been confirmed by Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temur Iakobashvili, while Georgian agency InterPressNews reported that an eyewitness had seen how an unmanned aeroplane flew over the coastline {{near the village of}} Primorskoe, followed by a jet, which then shot down the unmanned plane. Still, that day the Georgian Ministry of Defence initially denied that its spy plane had been shot down, stating that it was not conducting any flights over Abkhazia, and that Abkhazian reports were misinformation. In an interview to Mze TV, State Minister for Reintegration Iakobashvili stated that Abkhazia did not possess the <b>technical</b> <b>capability</b> for shooting down unmanned aircraft. According to Iakobashvili there was information that an incident involving an explosion had taken place in the Gali district, and he confirmed that eyewitnesses had seen aircraft, but since Georgia could not send people to the site, it was impossible to determine what had happened. He denounced what had taken place as further attempts to stage a military provocation.|$|E

Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, and turned back to work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized that much of what they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made it feel more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some sense of control, but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of the levers were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope and open up with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the <b>technical</b> <b>capability</b> to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E
