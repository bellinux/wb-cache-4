25|$|Visits to {{the theatre}} in Paris gave Resnais {{the desire to}} be an actor, and in 1939 he moved to Paris to become an {{assistant}} in Georges Pitoëff's company at the Théâtre des Mathurins. From 1940 to 1942 he studied acting in the Cours René-Simon (and one of his small jobs at this time was as an extra in the film Les Visiteurs du soir), but he then decided in 1943 to apply to the newly formed film school IDHEC to study film editing.

25|$|Since its founding, the RIPB had {{comprised}} 5 departments - Communications, Discipline, Human Resource, Welfare and the Gryphon's Committee (the latter's mandate was {{to drum up}} school spirit). Its Executive Committee {{constituted the}} Head and Deputy Head Prefects, together with the 10 Heads and Deputy Heads of each department. However, in July 2012, after an acrimonious schism between the previous Executive Committee and <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> oversaw the RIPB, the teachers initiated {{a comprehensive review of}} the RIPB's structure. It was the first in many years for the Board; and after 3 months of dialogues with students, teachers and the school management, the RIPB was streamlined to comprise 2 key branches, Standards and Spirit, reflecting the core mission of all prefects. The work of these 2 branches was supported by the Development branch. This top-down change generated a fair amount of controversy as the objections of numerous alumni to the changes were overruled by the school management.|$|E
25|$|Francisc Rainer was {{a native}} of Rohozna town, near Czernowitz, in Austrian-controlled Bukovina. His parents were Lutheran, but baptized their son Roman Catholic. His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the Romanian Old Kingdom as an {{employee}} of the Strusberg Company that built the Bucharest-Giurgiu railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of Căile Ferate Române. His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family, and was a housewife. The boy received his primary education at home from his parents, later attending Saint Sava National College. Among <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> were particularly helpful was Sabba Ștefănescu in natural sciences. Rainer read extensively, teaching himself Latin and Ancient Greek, and becoming passionate about the literary works of Goethe and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered Heraclitus, Ernst Haeckel, and classical materialistic thought. Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a Catholic missionary.|$|E

The series also introduced a new main character, rebellious and cynical tomboy Clem Burton (Jade Alleyne), who joins Nero's crew as well as mysterious spray paintings of Andress appear around Elmsmere, called 'The Phantom Sprayer', however it was later revealed that it was Mr. Bell who was the criminal. A new love interest for Dexter, Science teacher Lizzie Baker (Sarah Schoenbeck), is introduced in episode one. A new recurring character, Isobel Harlow (Ruby Barnhill) appears from episode three.

At the time of Fujita's sentence, 345 teachers had been punished for refusing to take part in anthem related events, though Fujita is the only man to have been convicted in relation to it. On September 21, 2006, the Tokyo District Court ordered the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to pay compensation to <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> had been subjected to punishment under the directive of the Tokyo Board of Education. The then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi commented, [...] "It is a natural idea to treat the national anthem importantly". The ruling has been appealed by the Metropolitan Government. Since October 23, 2003, 410 teachers and school workers have been punished for refusing to stand and sing the anthem as ordered by school principals. Teachers can also be punished if their students do not stand while [...] "Kimigayo" [...] is played during school ceremonies.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> {{reformed}} {{our religion}} in England bore no sort of resemblance to your present reforming doctors in Paris. Perhaps they were (like those whom they opposed) rather more {{than could be}} wished {{under the influence of}} a party spirit; but they were most sincere believers; men of the most fervent and exalted piety; ready to die (as some of them did die) like true heroes in defence of their particular ideas of Christianity,--as they would with equal fortitude, and more cheerfully, for that stock of general truth for the branches of which they contended with their blood. These men would have disavowed with horror those wretches who claimed a fellowship with them upon no other titles than those of their having pillaged the persons with whom they maintained controversies, and their having despised the common religion, for the purity of which they exerted themselves with a zeal which unequivocally bespoke their highest reverence for the substance of that system which they wished to reform. Many of their descendants have retained the same zeal, but (as less engaged in conflict) with more moderation. They do not forget that justice and mercy are substantial parts of religion. Impious men do not recommend themselves to their communion by iniquity and cruelty towards any description of their fellow-creatures.|$|E

Not even a man's memory, which {{generally}} makes light of hardship and glorifies early experiences, could ever soften Tennyson's hatred of school life. His complaint {{was not so much}} at the roughness of the boys, which had so frightened Cowper, as at the brutality of <b>the</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> put over the school door a wretched Latin inscription translating Solomon's barbarous advice about the rod and the child.

[...] After four years of most unsatisfactory school life, Tennyson returned home, and was fitted for the university by his scholarly father. With his brothers he wrote many verses, and his first efforts appeared in a little volume called Poems by Two Brothers, in 1827. The next year he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became the center of a brilliant circle of friends, chief of whom was the young poet Arthur Henry Hallam.|$|E
