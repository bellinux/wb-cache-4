The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly much younger than she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{directional}} dependence and scaling of air log permeability statistics characterizing minipermeameter measurements by Tidwell and Wilson {{on the faces}} of a 30 by 30 by 30 cm(3) size unsaturated block of Berea sandstone. We find distinct differences between the statistics and scaling behaviors of data measured on faces parallel <b>and</b> normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> <b>and</b> of incremental measurements in three orthogonal directions along these faces. Whereas the distribution on of data and their increments parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> are heavy tailed, those of increments normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> are Gaussian. Order q sample structure functions of increments parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> scale as powers xi(q) of directional lag, s(d), over limited ranges of s(d). Using moment and extended self-similarity methods of analysis we find xi(q) to be generally nonlinear in q, tending to be concave in q on faces normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> convex on faces parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding.</b> Whereas the literature attributes nonlinear scaling of xi(q) with q to multifractals or fractional Laplace motions, we find the data to be consistent with sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated (monofractal, self-affine) fractional Gaussian noise. The increments exhibit negative statistical dependence (antipersistence) that varies with direction parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> is more pronounced on faces parallel than normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding...</b>|$|R

5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E

Celia {{suspects}} Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby {{tells of the}} wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced.

40|$|Striped bedding-veins are veins {{that lie}} subparallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> have an {{internal}} layering or lineation {{at a small}} angle to the veins’ long axis. They form during bedding-parallel slip {{and can be used}} as shear sense indicators. Solid inclusion trails produce the visible internal layering or lineation and track the opening direction of the veins. Elongate quartz crystals however can be oriented at an angle of up to 80 ° to the opening direction, are non-tracking, and contain almost no information on the shear sense. The striped bedding-veins can be separated into three types according to the geometry of their internal segmentation. Veins of type B opened parallel to jogs oriented at a low angle <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> veins of type J opened parallel to jogs oriented at a high angle <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> veins of type O opened orthogonal <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> jogs. Striped bedding-veins of types B and J contain crack–seal inclusion bands and displacement parallel inclusion trails. Striped bedding-veins of type O feature only crack–seal inclusion bands. The example of striped bedding-veins presented in this paper from the Orobic Alps of Italy belongs to type B. The lineation in the veins and the orientation of the inclusion bands and inclusion trails, as well as the orientation of steps in the vein wall, can be used to determine the sense of shear and the direction and amount of vein opening or bedding-parallel slip...|$|R

25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E
25|$|The time is 9.20pm. Sir Roger is {{enclosed}} {{in his study}} {{at the back of}} the hall.

Flora follows her mother <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> Raymond and Parker hear Sir Roger's voice coming from the other side of the door as he somewhat stiltedly tells an unknown person that he can give them no money as they require. Blunt enters from the terrace and he and Raymond go to the billiard room. Parker switches off the hall lights and leaves momentarily but re-enters a moment later to see Flora with her hand on the study door. She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September 1980, Bonham {{was picked}} up by Led Zeppelin {{assistant}} Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios for a tour of North America, to begin 17 October in Montreal, Quebec – the band's first since 1977. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he drank four quadruple vodka Screwdrivers (16 shots between 400–560 ml, also equivalent to 9-13 American standard drinks). He then continued to drink heavily after arriving at rehearsals. The band stopped rehearsing late in the evening and then went to Page's house, the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight on Thursday, 25 September, Bonham fell asleep; someone took him <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> placed him on his side. Led Zeppelin tour manager Benji LeFevre and John Paul Jones found him unresponsive the next afternoon. Bonham was later pronounced dead at 32 years old.|$|E
40|$|South African public {{hospitals}} have {{a shortage of}} hospital <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> struggle <b>to</b> allocate patients <b>to</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> keep track thereof. This contributes to inefficient utilisation of limited hospital capacity. In literature, this problem is called the bed management problem with specific focus on bed allocation. Different techniques have been studied in literature {{in an attempt to}} solve this problem. Various models have been created to solve this problem using exact solution modelling. These attempts have failed because the problem is to complex to solve with currently available exact solvers within an acceptable operations time. A heuristic and simulation models have also been developed to solve this problem with success. A comparison between these techniques show that agent based simulation modelling is the best suited for this specific problem. This report addresses this problem by creating a bed management model, us-ing agent-based simulation, that will better match patients <b>to</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> therefore maximise the capacity utilisation of a South African Public Hospital...|$|R
