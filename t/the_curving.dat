5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> sides {{were more likely to}} deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a way}} to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, {{as does the}} facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E

5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

50|$|For smooth or {{polygonal}} <b>curves,</b> <b>the</b> Jordan <b>curve</b> theorem can {{be proved}} in a straightforward way. Indeed <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has a tubular neighbourhood, {{defined in the}} smooth case by the field of unit normal vectors to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> or in <b>the</b> polygonal case by points {{at a distance of}} less than ε from the curve.In a neighbourhood of a differentiable point on <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> there is a coordinate change in which <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> becomes <b>the</b> diameter of an open disk.

This visual trick is common in classical buildings and is further amplified by the oversized windows and large balustrade on the third floor and roof.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Iosif Shklovsky {{proposed}} that the diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light. Three years later the theory was confirmed by observations.

The forestry soon takes over and residences become sporadic as the route winds {{its way through}} Elmhurst Township. The rail line moves to the east a bit as both the railroad and PA435 pass the Elmhurst Reservoir. Passing Fairview Memorial Park, Blue Shutters Road (State Route2010) soon merges in. After the reservoir ends, PA435 crosses under <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> rail line and continues northward into the hamlet of Elmhurst. Through Elmhurst, PA435 begins a parallel with PA590, which soon merges in with the main route. PA435 widens to a four-lane divided highway and continues northwestward out of Elmhurst, crossing over I-84. After this bridge, PA348 merges into the highway. PA348 ends at southbound PA435 while northbound PA435 passes over PA348 with a ramp connection to the route.

500|$|Bruce {{also worked}} on his own {{property}} at Balcaskie, Fife, which he bought in 1665, and which does survive intact, although with later alterations.

Gifford, however, attributes these to a later building phase. <b>The</b> <b>curving</b> walls, a form later seen at Hopetoun, were a new innovation if Bruce did carry them out, possibly inspired {{by the work of}} the Italian Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In the gardens he laid out parterres and stepped [...] "Italian" [...] terraces, with a vista leading the eye to the Bass Rock, all inspired by French baroque gardens such as Vaux-le-Vicomte. Internally, Bruce created a new layout of rooms, and it was for his continental-inspired internal planning, as much as his exterior design, that he was sought after as an architect.|$|E

500|$|The {{humpback}} {{was first}} identified as baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Regnum Animale of 1756. In 1781, Georg Heinrich Borowski described the species, converting Brisson's name to its Latin equivalent, Balaena novaeangliae. In 1804, Lacépède shifted the humpback {{from the family}} Balaenidae, renaming it B. jubartes. In 1846, John Edward Gray created the genus Megaptera, classifying the humpback as Megaptera longipinna, but in 1932, Remington Kellogg reverted the species names to use Borowski's novaeangliae. The common name is derived from <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> of their backs when diving. The generic name Megaptera from the Greek mega-/μεγα- [...] "giant" [...] and ptera/πτερα [...] "wing", refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means [...] "New Englander" [...] and was probably given by Brisson due to regular sightings of humpbacks {{off the coast of}} New England.|$|E

500|$|The new loop {{was formed}} by {{constructing}} a section of tunnel joining {{the end of the}} dead-end reversing tunnel to the west of Shepherd's Bush station and {{the north side of the}} depot. From Shepherd's Bush, trains ran anti-clockwise around the single track loop, first through the original depot access tunnel, then passed the north side of the depot and through the new station before entering the new section of tunnel and returning to Shepherd's Bush. Changes were also made to the depot layout to accommodate the new station and the new looped operations. Construction work on the exhibition site had started in January 1907, and the exhibition and new station opened on [...] 1908. The station was on the surface between the two tunnel openings and was a basic design by Harry Bell Measures.

500|$|Like the {{exterior}} of the building, the principal internal spaces are designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state. The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of {{the exterior}}, with <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> strata formed in native hardwoods. Oak, ash, beech, sycamore, alder, birch, chestnut and cherry woods from renewable sources in mid-Wales will be used together in proportions that reflect their relative availability from the forest. The design of the concourse galleries is intended to evoke the image of {{the edge of the forest}}, partly as a counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior, and partly because the edge of the forest in folklore and mythology represents a line between the real world and the magical world, a line which resembles the front edge of the theatre stage. The form of trees is created by the interweaving curvature of the gallery edges, and by the random positioning of the supporting columns. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of <b>the</b> <b>curving</b> path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.|$|E
