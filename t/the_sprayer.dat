2500|$|In DESI, {{there is}} a {{high-velocity}} pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample {{where it can be}} desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which <b>the</b> <b>sprayer</b> can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300°C with newer stages having built in CCD’s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI [...] is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{pesticide}} spraying in citrus crops with low-profile sprayers {{results in}} pest management problems {{because of the}} poor distribution of pesticide throughout the tree. Pesticide losses, particularly drift, are a concern {{with this type of}} sprayer especially in orchards situated in or near urban areas. The spray deposit on citrus leaves and fruit and off-target losses (canopy run-off and drift) were determined for air-assisted low-profile sprayers and air-assisted sprayers fitted with tower air conveyors (air-towers). <b>The</b> air-tower <b>sprayers</b> produced even distribution of leaf spray deposits through the full height of the tree canopy while <b>the</b> low-profile <b>sprayers</b> produced decreasing leaf spray deposits with increasing height in the trees. <b>The</b> Metters tower <b>sprayer</b> and Cropliner low-profile sprayer resulted in increasing deposits from the 0 degrees axis through to the 90 degrees axis to <b>sprayer</b> travel while <b>the</b> Barlow tower <b>sprayer</b> and <b>the</b> Hardi low-profile <b>sprayer</b> produced a more even distribution of deposits through <b>the</b> axes to <b>sprayer</b> travel.

40|$|Weed {{control is}} {{typically}} achieved by broadcast spraying postemergence herbicides {{on the entire}} orchard floor which wastes chemical by spraying bare ground. Growers can account for spatial variation in weed density and only spray weedy areas instead of applying herbicide to entire fields by using the automatic spot-sprayer, WeedSeeker sprayer. We conducted field experiments in flood- and microsprinikler-irrigated lemon orchards, and flood- and sprinkler-irrigated pecan orchards to measure the amount of herbicide applied, weed control, tree yield, and the economic value of adopting <b>the</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> compared to conventional boom spray technology. <b>The</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> reduced cumulative herbicide use by at least 36 % compared to <b>the</b> conventional boom <b>sprayer</b> at all sites. Weed control obtained using <b>the</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> was usually similar to <b>the</b> conventional boom <b>sprayer.</b> There were no effects of the treatments on yield at any location. The partial budget analysis, {{used to determine the}} economic value of adopting the technology, showed that as the area of the orchard and the cost of the herbicide increased, the time to recover the initial investment in <b>the</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> decreased. <b>The</b> investment in the technology can typically be recovered in less than five years in Arizona lemon and pecan orchards. We also conducted greenhouse experiments to determine the effect of various sensitivity settings and leaf area on the operational efficiency of <b>the</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer.</b> <b>The</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> did not detect and spray all broadleaf and monocot plants unless a sensitive setting was used. <b>The</b> WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> was more efficient when detecting broadleaf plants compared to monocot plants.

Finally, field studies were conducted in a non-bearing pecan orchard to evaluate weed management systems using various postemergence and preemergence herbicides.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to assess the}} outcomes on the spray patterns produced by the different feasible adjustments of two different air blast sprayers and one mist blower sprayer, commonly employed for treatments to Apulian "tendone" vineyards.
