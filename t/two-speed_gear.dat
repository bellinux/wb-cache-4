40|$|Problem of {{improving}} thrust at low speeds is primarily one of reducing {{angle of attack}} of operation of sections to improve L/D or reducing blade helix angle. An analysis, based on recent propeller data, is presented for determining improvements in thrust or efficiency which could be obtained by increased number of blades, increased blade width, increased diameter, dual rotation, and <b>two-speed</b> <b>gearing.</b> All methods were found very effective, particularly <b>two-speed</b> <b>gearing...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The pilot sat {{in an open}} cockpit {{beneath the}} upper wing's {{trailing}} edge, where a cut-out improved visibility. [...] It was generally agreed the all-round view was good. Control surfaces operated via a <b>two-speed</b> <b>gear</b> system to optimise them for fast and slow flying. The pilot had control of a fixed forward firing Vickers machine gun. The gunner behind him, whose need for an excellent field of fire had determined the tail arrangement, had the standard Scarff ring mounted Lewis gun of the time.|$|E
50|$|The paper chart {{is driven}} past the pen {{at a steady}} rate by a {{clockwork}} or electrical drive mechanism. One common method {{is to use a}} miniature synchronous motor which turns at a constant speed related to the power frequency; a gear-train is used to propel the paper. Industrial strip-chart recorders may have <b>two-speed</b> <b>gear</b> trains that allow a higher speed to be used for initial adjustments of a process or to follow process upsets. Medical and scientific recorders allow a wide range of accurately-controlled speeds to be set.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{methodology}} of establishing two-carrier planetary gear trains (PGT) equipped with a speed-changing system which contains breaks and clutches is considered. The reactive shaft is changed by means of breaks whereas the input and output shaft of the gear train are changed by clutches. Compound multi-speed planetary gear trains are obtained {{by a combination of}} two-carrier <b>two-speed</b> planetary <b>gear</b> trains controlled by only two breaks. The coding system of the <b>two-speed</b> planetary <b>gear</b> trains, which defines the connection between shafts of planetary gear sets and the shaft layout equipped with breaks, a driving and an operating machine is shown. It is established which variants of <b>two-speed</b> planetary <b>gear</b> trains are possible to combine by means of corresponding clutches in order to get two-variant or three-variant PGT. The methodology of choosing two-carrier PGT which are created by a combination of two or three two-speed variants within the frame of the same scheme is described as well as the example of finding an optimal three-speed PGT by means of the developed computer program 6 -brz is shown...|$|R

5000|$|The firm {{exhibited}} their Patent Agricultural Locomotive Engine for Threshing, Ploughing and General Traction Purposes at Battersea in 1862. Aveling {{moved the}} cylinder forward from over the firebox {{to the front}} of the boiler. The steam jacket that surrounds the cylinders did away with the need for a separate dome (the patent stated that the cylinders were placed within the dome). [...] The jacket reduced condensation, and hence priming, in the cylinders, valve gear and now non-existent supply piping. Ports between the jacket and boiler communicated live steam. The crankshaft was now close to the wheels and the long chain could be first shortened, then disposed of in favour of gears. In 1863 Aveling patented <b>two-speed</b> <b>gearing.</b> [...] Exports at this period were to Prussia and Australia.|$|R
50|$|The clutch is {{pneumatically}} operated. The gearbox is a non-synchronised six-speed ZF. In addition, the driven {{rear axle}} {{is equipped with}} an integrated <b>two-speed</b> reduction <b>gear</b> system. The tyre size is 11.00-20". At least one KB-112 logging vehicle, made for A. Ahlström, was equipped with Sisu Nemo hydraulic transmission system for trailers.|$|R
5000|$|The first American {{version of}} the Merlin was the Packard Merlin 28 (Mark XX), {{designated}} the V-1650-1 by the American military. This engine used a single-stage, two-speed supercharger. The <b>two-speed</b> <b>gearing</b> was - {{as well as for}} the [...] "R-R" [...] Merlins - from a French Farman patent license. As the Merlin 28, it was used for the Avro Lancaster bomber. The USAAF V-1650-1 version of this engine was used in the Curtiss P-40Fs. The initial Packard modifications to this engine changed the main crankshaft bearings from a copper lead alloy to a silver lead combination and featured indium plating. This had been developed by General Motors' Pontiac Division to prevent corrosion which was possible with lubricating oils that were used at that time. The bearing coating also improved break-in and load-carrying ability of the surface.|$|R

50|$|A Schlumpf Drive is a <b>two-speed</b> {{planetary}} <b>gear</b> assembly {{for use on}} bicycles. It {{is distinct}} from other bicycle planetary gear assemblies {{in that it is}} located behind the chainring rather than in the rear hub. A push-button {{on each side of the}} axle allows the rider to switch between high and low ratios. These are operated by the rider's heel.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{unicycle}} completions of the journey. The Guinness World Record for the fastest completion by unicycle is held by Roger Davies and Sam Wakeling, who rode 862 mi (Land’s End to John o' Groats) from 12 September to 18 September 2009 in 6 days, 8 hours and 43 minutes. [...] They rode large 36 in unicycles equipped with <b>two-speed</b> Schlumpf <b>geared</b> hubs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Two-speed</b> {{planetary}} <b>gear</b> trains {{with four}} external shafts, {{composed of two}} simple planetary gear trains, are considered in this paper. The labelling system of these trains is defined and all possible variants are determined. Planetary gear trains are divided into three different design groups, and characteristics of trains of each group are given. Possible power flows through the train at both gears for every group are described. An example of determining the function of transmission ratios of <b>two-speed</b> planetary <b>gear</b> trains {{by means of the}} torque method is shown. By research of kinematic schemes (design concepts) all train variants which can be created with an input and an output shaft {{on opposite sides of the}} train are identified, as well as those train variants where the aforementioned is not possible and their power input has to be placed between the brakes. All train variants where ideal torque ratios influence a change in the operating mode within the same gear are identified. A review of kinematic operating modes (reduction, multiplication, rotational direction of the output in relation to the input shaft) of all possible variants of the considered trains is given...|$|R
5000|$|Final {{drive to}} the wheels was by {{sprocket}} chain. Some locomotives had a sprocket gear ratio of 19:19 and others 15:19. In addition, there was a <b>two-speed</b> gearbox but <b>gears</b> could only be changed while the locomotive was stationary. Tractive effort was: ...|$|R
25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four <b>gearing</b> options: <b>two-speed</b> hub <b>gear</b> integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|R
50|$|In the 3 years {{leading up}} to 1913 William Brough had been {{developing}} a flat-twin engine in-line with the frame. It was very similar to the ABC engines of that period. This 497cc engine had overhead valves, 70mm bore and 64.5mm stroke, and had a magneto fitted above and a 2-speed gearbox below. By the end of 1914 it had replaced all other engines in the Brough range, and using it only 3-models were planned for 1915. The three models were the HS - which was fitted with a <b>two-speed</b> countershaft <b>gear</b> operated by dog clutches, with chain drive to the gearbox, and John Bull rubber belt drive to the rear wheel over an adjustable pulley allowing the top gear range to be varied. No clutch or kick-start was provided. The second model was the HB, which was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gearbox and handle starter. The third model was the HTT, which was very similar to the HS but fitted with a specially tuned engine with high-compression, lightweight steel pistons, different camshafts, and special front cylinder lubrication.|$|R
50|$|The {{supercharger}} {{was rather}} basic {{in the early}} models, using a single-stage <b>two-speed</b> design directly <b>geared</b> to the engine (unlike the DB 601's hydraulically clutched version) which led to rather limited altitude performance, in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage. One key advancement was the Kommandogerät (command-device), a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow, propeller pitch, supercharger setting, mixture and ignition timing {{in response to a}} single throttle lever, dramatically simplifying engine control. The Kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|R
5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a cone pulley designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the cone pulley. Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had <b>two-speed</b> back <b>gears</b> which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|R
40|$|Battery {{electric}} vehicles (BEVs) represent a possible sustainable solution for personal urban transportation. Presently, the most limiting characteristic of BEVs is their short range, {{mainly because of}} battery technology limitations. A proper design {{and control of the}} drivetrain, aimed at reducing the power losses and thus increasing BEV range, can contribute to make the electrification of urban transportation a convenient choice. This paper presents a simulation-based comparison of the energy efficiency performance of six drivetrain architectures for BEVs. Although many different drivetrain and transmission architectures have been proposed for BEVs, no literature was found regarding BEVs equipped with infinitely variable transmissions (IVTs). The analyzed drivetrain configurations are: single- (1 G) and <b>two-speed</b> (2 G) <b>gear</b> drives, half toroidal (HT) and full toroidal (FT) continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), and infinitely variable transmissions (IVTs) with two different types of internal power flow (IVT-I and IVT-II). An off-line procedure for determining the most efficient control action for each drivetrain configuration is proposed, which allows selecting the optimal speed ratio for each operating condition. The energy consumption of the BEVs is simulated along the UDC (Urban Driving Cycle) and Japanese 10 - 15 driving cycle, with a backward facing approach. In order to achieve the lowest energy consumption, a trade-off between high transmission efficiency and flexibility in terms of allowed speed ratios is required...|$|R
