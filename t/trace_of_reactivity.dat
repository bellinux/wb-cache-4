40|$|The enterobacterial common antigen (CA) {{is present}} in {{salmonellae}} of groups B (S. typhimurium) and C 1 (S. montevideo). Mutation at the rfe gene(s), which {{is required for the}} biosynthesis of O side chains of the lipopolysaccharide in group C 1 (S- 6, 7) but not in group B (S- 4, 12), destroys the capacity of the bacteria to synthesize CA. When such mutated group C 1 rfe genes (C-rfe−) were introduced into group B strains, the hybrids also became CA− and could be restored to CA+ by introduction of either C-rfe+ or B-rfe+ (corresponding genetic region in group B). This indicated the presence of genes for CA synthesis at the rfe site in both groups B and C 1. In rfe− mutants of group C 1, which were rough and CA−, the CA+ phenotype could be restored by replacing the rfe− gene(s) with C-rfe+. In contrast, B-rfe+ was able to support the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>trace</b> amounts <b>of</b> CA only, although it was sufficient to restore their ability to synthesize the S- 6, 7 side chain of the lipopolysaccharide. Corresponding hybrids (B-rfe+, C-rfb+ or C-rfb−) were constructed by introducing the C-rfb genes into a group B strain; they also showed only a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> CA <b>reactivity...</b>|$|R

The NMR spectra show that 1 is a fluxional system in solution at room temperature, as the Rh(diphos) moiety rotates freely around its Rh-(η 6 -Ph) bond vector. In coordinating solvents, easy decoordination of the tetraphenylborate anion occurs to afford [Rh(diphos) (S) 2]BPh 4 (S is the solvent). The thermal behaviour of 1 {{has also been}} studied. By heating in acetone under controlled conditions, 1 is easily converted into Rh(diphos) Ph, prepared in low yield by reacting Rh(diphos) Cl(S) with PhLi. Prolonged heating, at 348 K, of solutions of 1 produces good yields of benzene and biphenyl, together with <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> terphenyl.

40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} {{approach for}} the direct mea-surement <b>of</b> <b>trace</b> gas <b>reactivity</b> on ambient aerosol parti-cles has been developed. The method utilizes a newly de-signed entrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a custom-built chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The exper-imental method is described via {{application to the}} mea-surement of the N 2 O 5 reaction probability, γ (N 2 O 5). La-boratory investigations on well characterized aerosol par-ticles show that measurements of γ (N 2 O 5) observed with this technique are in agreement with previous observations, using conventional flow tube methods, to within ± 20 % at atmospherically relevant particle surface area concen-trations (0 – 1000 µm 2 cm− 3). Uncertainty in the measured γ (N 2 O 5) is discussed {{in the context of}} fluctuations in po-tential ambient biases (e. g., temperature, relative humidity and trace gas loadings). Under ambient operating condi-tions we estimate a single-point uncertainty in γ (N 2 O 5) that ranges between ± (1. 3 × 10 − 2 + 0. 2 ×γ (N 2 O 5)), and ± (1. 3 × 10 − 3 + 0. 2 ×γ (N 2 O 5)) for particle surface area con-centrations of 100 to 1000 µm 2 cm− 3, respectively.

Despite the general simplicity of the physical concept <b>of</b> <b>reactivity</b> and the rapid development of modern density functional theory (DFT) methods, this task remains state-of-the-art for systems with wavefunctions that have a multiconfigurational character. In such cases, for the accurate description <b>of</b> <b>reactivity</b> one needs to use multiconfigurational approaches that are much heavier computationally then ordinary single-determinant DFT methods. Moreover, the complexity of the calculation <b>of</b> <b>reactivity</b> is increased by the necessity to calculate ionic and transition states. These computational challenges can be addressed by employing the concepts of Koopmans' theorem and its extension to a multiconfigurational case. We present a simplified methodology for the calculation of Fukui functions, based on Koopmans' approximation for multiconfigurational Green's functions developed in our previous works. Also, an extension of this methodology based on perturbation theory has been developed to improve accuracy. 9 2013 Published by NRC Research Press. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
