Although the scope of prosecutable offenses under the War Crimes Act is limited, other federal laws present prosecutors with multiple options for bringing an American citizen to justice in either a federal court or military court-mardal for a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> <b>The</b> cases <b>of</b> United States v. Passam and United Stales v. Green demonstrate that Americans who violate <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> can be, and have been, prosecuted by using means other than the War Crimes Act. This Note highlights deficiencies, however, in federal laws that create circumstances where immunity from prosecution exists for certain assaults that violate <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> <b>The</b> Note then concludes with recommendations for congressional action to change federal <b>law</b> and <b>the</b> Uniform Code of Military Justice to fix existing deficiencies and strengthen the ability of the U.

5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> as civilians {{were caught in the}} ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E
5|$|Since {{laws of war}} demand {{ambulances}} {{be marked}} {{with one of the}} Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount offensive weapons, military ambulances are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as non-combatants; however, this application does not always exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. <b>The</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties.

Both sides disregarded <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the United Arab Emirates provided the NTC with weaponry and training.
