However, controlled cross-pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them.|$|E

5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the courts}} have not ruled on the {{question}} of fetal personhood, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been raised in two cases, Tremblay v. Daigle and R. v. Sullivan.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> also {{arisen in}} the United Kingdom, where {{religious}} schools {{are allowed to}} select all, or a proportion of their intake based upon religion. A 2009 ruling, R(E) v Governing Body of JFS, determined that the definition of Jewish religion based upon descent constituted discrimination on ethnic grounds, and therefore contravened racial discrimination laws.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, {{that it is}} reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, {{that it is possible to}} answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of {{which of these}} two characters men prefer has endured long {{after the end of}} the series. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> inspired commercials, essays, videos, and a sermon. By most accounts, the wholesome, down-to-earth Mary Ann has consistently outpolled the glamorous bombshell movie-star Ginger by a sizable margin. Bob Denver admitted he was a Mary Ann fan. According to Bob Denver in a 2001 interview, Wells received 3,000â€“5,000 fan letters weekly, whereas Louise may have gotten 1,500 or 2,000.|$|E

Both authors claim {{that it is possible to}} answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Christian mathematicians and scientists, most notably Leonhard Euler, Bernard d'Espagnat and John Lennox, disagree with that kind of skeptical argument.|$|E
25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> {{been more}} {{involved}} to settle. The {{reason is that}} the theory becomes strongly coupled in this case and perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E

25|$|When {{a feature}} has both artistic (copyrightable) and {{functional}} (patentable) merits, when <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> appeared in US court, {{the courts have}} often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can {{be separated from the}} functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 a Constitutional Convention {{was held}} with Charles B. Galbreath as secretary. The result {{reflected}} {{the concerns of}} the Progressive Era. It introduced the initiative and the referendum. In addition, it allowed the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on Ohio's general election ballots every 20 years. The question asks whether a new convention is required. Although <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, it has never been approved. Instead constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.|$|E
25|$|While China was {{the birthplace}} of {{gunpowder}} the guns there remained relatively small and light, weighing less than 80 kilograms or less for the large ones, and only a couple kilograms at most for the small ones during the early Ming era. Guns themselves had proliferated throughout China and become a common sight during sieges, so <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>has</b> arisen then why large guns were not first developed in China. According to Tonio Andrade, this wasn't a matter of metallurgy, which was sophisticated in China, and the Ming dynasty did construct large guns in the 1370s, but never followed up afterwards. Nor was it the lack of warfare, which other historians have suggested to be the case, but does not stand up to scrutiny as walls were a constant factor of war which {{stood in the way}} of many Chinese armies since time immemorial into the twentieth century. The answer Andrade provides is simply that Chinese walls were much less vulnerable to bombardment. Andrade argues that traditional Chinese walls were built differently from medieval European walls in ways which made them more resistant to cannon fire.|$|E
