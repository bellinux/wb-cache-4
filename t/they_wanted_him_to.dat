By this point, Davis held every record for a jet pilot, {{including}} most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over propeller-driven aircraft.

5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to,</b> they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E

At first, Falco is afraid that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> raid the treasures brought back after the conquest. However, they then tell Falco that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> look for a [...] "Lost Ark".

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane.

They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute.

In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E

They wanted Adam to have a different dynamic than Tom; the producers set up a girlfriend/boyfriend storyline in the first series [...] with Adam, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have a wife (Fiona Carter) who works in the Security Service, since married couples working in that environment are common. They wanted Adam to be more animated and energetic than Tom. Writer Howard Brenton wanted him to have an MI6 background, and have something awful happen to him in the past. Brenton invented the backstory of Syria early on into the third series, which he wanted to revisit in the fourth series.|$|E

He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did.

500|$|Mary Godwin {{may have}} first met the radical poet-philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley in the {{interval}} between her two stays in Scotland. By the time she returned home {{for a second time}} on 30 March 1814, Percy Shelley had become estranged from his wife and was regularly visiting Godwin, whom he had agreed to bail out of debt. Percy Shelley's radicalism, particularly his economic views, which he had imbibed from William Godwin's Political Justice (1793), had alienated him from his wealthy aristocratic family: <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> follow traditional models of the landed aristocracy, and he wanted to donate large amounts of the family's money to schemes intended to help the disadvantaged. Percy Shelley therefore had difficulty gaining access to money until he inherited his estate, because his family did not want him wasting it on projects of [...] "political justice". After several months of promises, Shelley announced that he either could not or would not pay off all of Godwin's debts. Godwin was angry and felt betrayed.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{creating}} the new identity for Warriors of Rock was by creating the game's Quest mode. Activision contacted Gene Simmons, who initially thought the company was asking for a KISS song {{to be included in}} the game. Instead, when Simmons learned <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be the narrator and the voice of the Demigod, he became very interested in the project feeling that the Demigod character had elements of his own stage personality in it. Activision also approached the members of Rush for inclusion of [...] "2112", and the group provided inspiration and feedback on the Rush-themed venues that [...] "2112" [...] is played in within the game. The developers also approached Dave Mustaine of Megadeth to write the music for the game's final boss battle. [...] The Quest mode also gave Activision the opportunity to explore the characters that have been in the series since its inception but otherwise only used as player avatar. The developers were able to expand on these existing designs and gave each one a unique venue and setlist throughout the campaign.|$|E

With Hershiser's September 14 win, the Dodgers maintained a 6.5-game lead. Hershiser's record on the season against the Braves was 5–0 with a 1.29 ERA. The game marked only {{the third time in}} 1988 that he pitched on three days rest. Lasorda and Perranoski moved Hershiser's start up one day because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> pitch the next week against the second-place Houston Astros. [...] With the streak at 31 innings Hershiser tied Jackson in number of wins, and moved into a tie for the sixth longest scoreless streak for the franchise since the 1958 relocation to Los Angeles. Although Drysdale's record was mentioned after he reached 31 consecutive innings, the focus of the media was on the Cy Young Award race with Jackson. The win was Hershiser's seventh consecutive against the Braves, a streak that began on September 13, 1987.|$|E
