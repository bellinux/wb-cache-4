50|$|This is {{the primary}} route to polyamide-imides which are used as wire enamels. A diisocyanate, often 4,4’-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI), is reacted with <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TMA). The product {{achieved}} {{at the end of}} this process is a high molecular weight, fully imidized polymer solution with no condensation byproducts, since the carbon dioxide gas byproduct is easily removed. This form is convenient for the manufacture of wire enamel or coatings. The solution viscosity is controlled by stoichiometry, monofunctional reagents, and polymer solids. The typical polymer solids level is 35-45% and it may be diluted further by the supplier or user with diluents.|$|E

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{conversion}} (DC) of camphorquinone/amine-based adhesives {{is affected by}} acidic functional monomers due to inactivation of the amine co-initiator through acid-base reaction. During bonding, functional monomers of self-etch adhesives chemically interact with hydroxyapatite (HAp). Here, we tested in how far the latter interaction of functional monomers with HAp counteracts the expected reduction in DC of camphorquinone/amine-based adhesives. DC of three experimental adhesive formulations, either containing {{one of the two}} functional monomers, namely 10 -MDP (10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate) and 4 -META (4 -methacryloxyethyl <b>trimellitic</b> acid <b>anhydride),</b> or a version without functional monomer (no-FM; control), was measured with and without HAp powder added to the adhesive formulations. Both the variables ‘functional monomer’ and ‘HAp’ were found to be significant, with the functional monomer reducing DC and HAp counteracting this effect. It is concluded that the functional monomers 10 -MDP and 4 -META interfere with the polymerization efficiency of adhesives. This interference is less prominent in the presence of HAp, which would clinically correspond to when these two functional monomers of the adhesive simultaneously interact with HAp in tooth tissue. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Patients with work-related {{respiratory}} symptoms {{caused by}} inhaled acid <b>anhydrides</b> (<b>trimellitic</b> (TMA), phthalic (PA), tetrachlorophthalic (TCPA), and maleic anhydrides) have specific IgE antibody. The antibody is specific for a conjugate of the sensitizing anhydride (the hapten) and human serum albumin (HSA). We {{have investigated the}} specificity of the reaction {{to determine whether the}} antibody is directed against (1) the anhydride, (2) new antigenic determinants formed by conjugation of albumin with the anhydride, or (3) the complete anhydride-HSA conjugate. For the patients sensitized to TCPA and TMA, RAST inhibition studies demonstrate the anhydride-HSA conjugate to be a more effective inhibitor of RAST than the sodium salt of the anhydride or an anhydride-bovine serum albumin conjugate, whereas for those sensitized to PA, the free hapten is almost as an effective inhibitor as the conjugate. With each sera HSA conjugates of anhydrides to which the patient is not sensitized are weaker inhibitors than the sensitizing anhydride-albumin conjugate. These results provide strong evidence that for the patients sensitized to TCPA and TMA, the antibody combines with the anhydride and the spatially adjacent portion of the HSA molecule, whereas in the patients sensitized to PA, the antibody is specific for the hapten...|$|R

40|$|The present studies {{examined}} the effects of oral treatment with cyclosporin A, betamethasone or azelastine administered over the time of sensitization with <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> on allergen-induced airway responses, compared to those of control animals given corn oil alone. Drugs were given for 8 days. The animals were sensitized with <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (0. 1 ml of 0. 3 % w/v) in corn oil given intradermally on days 4 and 5 of drug treatment. Three to four weeks after sensitization with free <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> the animals were anesthetized, tracheostomized and challenged with <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> conjugated to guinea pig serum albumin (trimellitic anhydride-guinea pig serum albumin; 0. 5 %; 50 microliters) instilled via the airway route. In the same animal, we measured both lung resistance (RL) to monitor airflow obstruction, and extravasation of Evans Blue dye (20 mg/kg) to quantify airway plasma exudation. In control animals, instillation of trimellitic anhydride-guinea pig serum albumin into the tracheal lumen caused a slowly progressing increase in RL over the observation period (6 min), in addition to extravasation of Evans Blue dye at all airway levels. In animals treated with 50 mg/kg of cyclosporin A, both the allergen-induced increase in RL and extravasation of Evans Blue dye in intrapulmonary airways were significantly attenuated. However, neither betamethasone nor azelastine significantly affected these responses. We conclude that cyclosporin A may influence the immune system in the guinea pig during the induction of allergy, thus leading to attenuation of allergen-induced airway obstruction at later time points...|$|E
40|$|The Rhodium catalyzed maleinisation of {{monounsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} leads to cyclic 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid derivatives and acyclic maleinated byproducts, which {{are similar to}} the products formed by Ene-reaction. Two different catalysts, RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 and Rh(OAc) 2, were investigated. It was found that Rh(OAc) 2 shows a higher selectivity toward the cyclic products as well as higher conversions compared to RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3. Furthermore it was observed that the double bond configuration of the fatty acid influences the yields and the product composition of the maleinated products. The Rh(OAc) 2 -catalysis leads mainly to the cyclic THPAs. If the cis-configurated oleic acid is used, one cyclic main product is formed, whereas the trans-configurated elaidic acid leads to three different isomers. Furthermore a decrease of the overall yield of the maleinated products was observed for elaidic acid, compared to oleic acid. In contrast to that, the RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 -catalyst tends to result favorably {{in the formation of the}} acyclic products. If oleic acid is used, the formation of two different constitutional syn-isomers was observed. In addition to that the maleinisation of elaidic acid gives also the anti-form, so that four different products could be detected by NMR-experiments. Practical applications: Fatty acid based 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid (THPA) derivatives are promising monomers for polycondensation processes. The substructure of the six-membered carbon ring is of great interest for the hardness of the resulting polyesters. The mentioned THPA derivatives are commonly synthesized via Diels-Alder reaction of conjugated fatty acids and maleic anhydride. The main disadvantage of this synthesis route is caused by monounsaturation of many natural fatty acids, e. g., oleic acid, or by the non-conjugation of the most natural fatty acids, e. g., linoleic acid which requires a further step for conjugation. The Rh-catalyzed maleinisation enables the synthesis of such cyclic structures using monounsaturated fatty acids, e. g., oleic acid. The resulting THPAs are considered to be biobased substitutes with good prospects, e. g., for phthalic acid <b>anhydride,</b> <b>trimellitic</b> acid and their di-, tetra-, or hexahydro-derivatives, which are commonly used in polycondensation processes. These fatty acid based THPAs may open the door towards new advanced biobased products, e. g., for lacquers and coatings...|$|R

This is a case control study of 17 individuals with LRSS, 12 with asthma and 22 TMA similarly exposed individuals who did not develop LRSS or asthma. Comparing the sensitized individuals (LRSS or asthma) with the non-sensitized individuals (controls), we found no difference in frequency of any HLA antigen. In summary, the lack of association of HLA antigens with LRSS or asthma due to TMA suggests that these will not be useful markers to identify at risk individuals...|$|E

We studied the effect of intradermal sensitization with ovalbumin (OA) in oily vehicle on immune and airway responses in guinea pigs. We also compared airway responses to <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> or Dermatophagoides farinae (DF; mite) with those to OA in guinea pigs intradermally sensitized to respective allergens. Three to four weeks after sensitization, the animals were challenged with intratracheal instillation of these allergens. Intradermal injections with OA developed dose-dependently specific IgG 1 antibodies to OA demonstrated by ELISA. In animals sensitized with different doses of OA in corn oil vehicle, a challenge with OA induced a reversely dose-dependent airflow obstruction and airway plasma exudation. In contrast, animals sensitized with OA in saline vehicle had dose-dependent airway responses to OA. Challenge with OA caused an immediate peak and subsequently persistent airflow obstruction, whereas this response to either TMA guinea pig serum albumin or Df was slowly progressive in animals sensitized to respective allergens. The animals sensitized to TMA or Df may show a different profile of airway responses following the challenge compared to OA. Intradermal sensitization may be a valuable method of sensitization for the development of an animal model of airway allergy to different types of allergens, including chemicals or mites...|$|E

Systemic effects were subsequently assessed by determination of spleen liver and kidney weights, skin effects by determination of swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration of the ears, and immune effects by determination of weight and proliferative activity of the local lymph nodes (LLN). Following application (x 3) of DNCB or TMA, minor systemic effects were observed, as indicated by slightly elevated spleen and liver weights in a few rat strains and the mice. Skin effects, consisting of increased ear thickness and presence of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates, were observed in all rat strains treated with DNCB or TMA.

Total RNA was isolated from lung lobes of 6 – 8 animals in each of four treatment groups and hybridized to Affymetrix U 74 Av 2 GeneChips. False discovery rates (q-values) were calculated from an overall F test to identify candidate genes with differences i...|$|E
40|$|Allergic airway {{diseases}} {{caused by}} low–molecular weight chemicals including <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TMA) {{have been linked}} to Th 2 cytokines and are characterized by mucus hypersecretion and infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils into the airways. The most common route of human exposure to chemical re-spiratory allergens is inhalation. Most murine models, however, use topical exposure to sensitize mice. The present study tests the hypothesis that topical sensitization on the ears of mice with TMA will induce a qualitatively similar immunologic and pathologic response in the nasal airways after intranasal challenge to that induced after intranasal sensitization and challenge. A/J mice were sensitized topically or by intranasal instillation followed by intranasal challenge with TMA in an ethyl acetate/olive oil vehicle. Intranasal challenge with TMA in mice that were either topically or intranasally sensitized with TMA caused a marke...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the release of granule-associated {{inflammatory}} amines by isolated mouse tissue-type mast cells is subject to regulation in vitro {{by a number of}} cytokines that are produced during the immune response. In this study we investigated whether mast cell secretory function might also be subject to regulation in vivo during active sensitization. Mice were sensitized with one of three chemical allergens (<b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> TMA; 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene, DNCB; or oxazolone) all of which induce contact sensitization and one of which (TMA) in addition causes immediate hypersensitivity. Peritoneal mast cells isolated from treated mice and sensitized passively with IgE released a greater proportion of cellular serotonin (5 -HT) on stimulation either by anti-IgE or by specific antigen than did cells isolated from vehicle-treated controls. These results show that the function of mast cells is susceptible in vivo to regulatory influences that result from induction of an immune response...|$|E
40|$|Phenylethynyl {{terminated}} novel imide compound {{based on}} 1, 3 -bis(3 -aminophenoxy) benzene (APB) and phenylethynyl <b>trimellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (PETA) were prepared. The curing behavior of phenylethynyl terminated imide compound was investigated by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The curing reaction of phenylethynylcarbonyl end group completed at 220 °C, and proceeded much faster than that of phenylethynyl end group. Glass transition temperature of the thermosetting resin from phenylethynylcarbonyl terminated novel imide compound determined by dynamic mechanical analysis was almost {{the same as that}} of o-cresolnovolac type epoxy resin. In addition, the thermosetting resin from phenylethynylcarbonyl terminated novel imide compound exhibited excellent thermal and dimensional stabilities. These excellent properties of these phenylethynyl terminated imide compound might be due to the incorporation of alkene group or aromatic ring substitutes in the backbones, which might enhance the chain interaction (molecular packing) and reduce the molecular chain mobility...|$|E
