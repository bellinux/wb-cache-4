40|$|From {{the late}} Middle Ages, the 15 th century that is, {{until the late}} 18 th to early 19 th century, what today is called the Balkans, was an {{integral}} part of the Ottoman Empire. As a result Europeans were not really concerned about the Balkans, other than their being the outer limit of the Ottoman Empire in European terrain. Any thoughts that they might have had about the Balkan populations was limited to the notion of Christian Turks. However, during the late 18 th and throughout the 19 th century, all that changed. 1 First of all, during the 19 th century the Christians in the Balkan Peninsula experienced ‘national awakenings ’ and, thus, formed dif-ferent nationalisms which resulted in revolutions against the Otto-man Empire. This placed the Balkans, especially the southern and eastern Balkans, 2 in the European Powers’ 3 center of attention, since all of them, more or less had interests lying with the Ottoman Empire’s fate. About the northern parts of the Balkans, which be-longed to the Austrian–Hungarian Empire, nationalism started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>roots</b> there too, especially after the revolution of 1848 in Hun-gary.

40|$|There {{has been}} great concern in recent years {{regarding}} the efficiency of marketing {{of fruits and vegetables}} in India. It is believed that poor efficiency in the marketing channels and poor marketing infrastructure leading to high and fluctuating consumer prices and {{only a small portion of}} the consumer rupee reaching the producer farmers. This paper examines these aspects in regulated wholesale markets for fruits and vegetables in Ahmedabad City area. These regulated markets were established to improve the marketing efficiency. The system of sale followed in these markets indicated that open auction as a system of sale is yet <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>roots</b> in these markets and the marketing system was dominated by open auction or secret bidding resulting to significant erosion of marketing efficiency. Analysis of marketing costs indicated that on an average they hover around 8 percent of the consumer price for vegetables 11 to 15 percent for fruits. On an average the share of farmers in consumer rupee was hardly 48 percent for vegetables and 37 percent for fruits. The study suggests that regulated wholesale markets can help in improving the marketing efficiency by promoting direct contact with the farmers, increasing the number of buyers and sellers in the market, promoting open auction system of marketing and strengthening or introducing facilities and services such as go-down, cold storage, transparency and access to internal and external market environment. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of semi-dwarfing, high-yielding and nutrients-responsive crop varieties in the 1960 s and 1970 s alleviated {{the suffering of}} low crop yield, food shortages and epidemics of famine in India {{and other parts of}} the Asian continent. Two semi-dwarfing genes, Rht in wheat and Sd- 1 in rice heralded the green revolution for which Dr. Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. In contrast, the revolutionary new genetics of crop improvement shamble over formidable obstacles of regulatory delays, political interferences and public misconceptions. India benefited immensely from the green revolution and is now grappling to deal with the nuances of GM crops. The development of GM mustard discontinued prematurely in 2001 and insect-resistant Bt cotton varieties were successfully approved for commercial cultivation in 2002 in an evolving nature of regulatory system. However, the moratorium on Bt brinjal by MOEF in 2010 meant a considerable detour from an objective, science-based, rigorous institutional process of regulatory approval to a more subjective, nonscience-driven, political decision-making process. This study examines what ails the regulatory system of GM crops in India and the steps that led to the regulatory logjam. Responding to the growing challenges and impediments of existing biosafety regulation, it suggests options that are critical for GM crops <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>roots</b> for a multiplier harvest...|$|E
40|$|Conference Theme: Asian Urbanism and BeyondBreakout Session 6 Session 6 : Urban GovernanceTheme 1 : Urban DevelopmentThe {{changing}} form {{of political}} economy accords a distinctive regime of accumulation and state regulation in Fordism and post-Fordism. This paper advocates an alternative methodological approach of state by reading state spatiality as a self-reflexive attribute integral to the state regulatory capacity. In this paper, the changing mode of regulation and state spatiality will be examined under different regimes of accumulation. New state spatiality embodies as an articulation of both scalar and networked imaginaries. This is followed by examinations of the political economy in China since economic reform and open-up. Three interpretations, namely, local state corporatism, local growth coalition and urban entrepreneurism will be revisited and discussed. These interpretations indicate local state has become an object of regulation. Since 1990 s, the scales of political economy restructure upwards {{to the level of}} city region.
