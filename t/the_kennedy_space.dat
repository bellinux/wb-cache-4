5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center. They landed at about 1:00a.m., only five {{hours after the}} fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to {{determine}} the individuals who {{would be on the}} NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was first}} {{assigned}} to Discovery with a launch date no earlier than May 2008. This originally moved the mission ahead of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Delays to several shuttle missions {{resulted in a}} change in mission ordering, and the orbiter was changed to Atlantis on 8 January 2007. The crew of Atlantis went to <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center for the Crew Equipment Interface Test in early July 2008. This allowed the STS-125 crew to get familiar with the orbiter and the hardware they would be using during the flight.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions {{were delivered}} by North American Aviation to <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center with long lists of equipment problems {{which had to}} be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg was {{assigned}} as Payload Specialist on STS-51B Challenger (April 29â€“May 6, 1985).

It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard Challenger conducted investigations into crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, and laboratory-animal and human medical monitoring.|$|E

5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During a speech at <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on the launch pad. During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall just south of <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center {{on the morning of}} August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and {{there was no time to}} roll Challenger back from the pad; the decision was made to secure the launch stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{action was}} taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, {{predicted}} to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish. A total of 200,000people evacuated in Louisiana. At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000people stayed in those shelters. The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 meals to the area. A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations. The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center was threatened by the storm, {{the first time a}} launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston. Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm. In New Iberia, Louisiana, hardware stores ran out of stock, and businesses in Lafayette, Louisiana reported similar shortages.|$|E
5|$|The University of Central Florida (UCF) is a {{metropolitan}} public research and space-grant university {{located on a}} 1,415-acre (5.73km2) main campus in Orlando, Florida, United States. UCF is a member institution of the State University System of Florida and is the largest university in the United States in terms of undergraduate enrollment. It was founded in 1963 as Florida Technological University {{with the goal of}} providing highly trained personnel to support <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida's Space Coast. After the university's academic scope expanded in the mid and late 1970s to encompass a wider variety of disciplines, the school was renamed The University of Central Florida in 1978. Initial enrollment in 1968 was 1,948 students; as of 2014, the university has 59,770 students from more than 140 countries, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Since the university's first graduating class in 1970, UCF has awarded more than 250,000 degrees, including 45,000 graduate and professional degrees, to over 200,000 alumni.|$|E
