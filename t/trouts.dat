In forests are present numerous animals of cynegetic interest, including deer, stag, bear, fox, lynx, wild boar, squirrel, and on Someș Valley naturally entered the muskrat. Around artificial lakes live a series of birds (duck, coot, stork), in the Someș Plateau and Transylvanian Plain was colonized the pheasant, and in Turda Gorge area lives the rock eagle. Mountain rivers are populated with <b>trouts,</b> graylings and nases, and in the lower ones with barbel and chub.|$|E
25|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example of}} competitive exclusion was observed to occur between Dolly Varden charr (Trout)(Salvelinus malma) and white spotted char (<b>Trout)(S.</b> leucomaenis) in Japan. Both {{of these species}} were morphologically similar but the former species was found primarily at higher elevations than the latter. Although there was a zone of overlap, each species excluded the other from its dominant region by becoming better adapted to its habitat over time. In some such cases, each species gets displaced into an exclusive segment of the original habitat. Because each species suffers from competition, natural selection favors the avoidance of competition in such a way.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand <b>trouts</b> are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow.

French and Italian wines were served, as well as mead and local beers. The dishes were made only according to French recipes. The royal court with all its innovations exerted a broad influence {{over the rest of}} aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland. French cuisine was in fashion and many families willingly employed French cooks and pâté makers. In the mid-18th century on Polish tables appeared the French champagne. Also, among the most influential in that period were Lithuanian, Jewish, German and Hungarian cuisine, not to mention Armenian, which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers especially in the south-eastern part of the Commonwealth. Signature dishes of the Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland's neighbor - the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of Lwów, Kraków, Kamieniec Podolski and Zamość due to many Armenians living there permanently. Also, because of the close contact with the Ottoman Empire, coffee (kawa) and boza became popular.|$|E
500|$|Fish size, age, {{concentration}} of triactinomyxon spores, and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish, {{as does the}} species of the fish in question. [...] The disease has {{the most impact on}} fish less than five months old because their skeletons have not ossified. [...] This makes young fish more susceptible to deformities and provides M. cerebralis more cartilage on which to feed. [...] In one study of seven species of many strains, brook trout and rainbow trout (except one strain) were far more heavily affected by M. cerebralis after two hours of exposure than other species were, while bull trout, Chinook salmon, brown trout, and Arctic grayling were least severely affected. [...] While brown trout may harbor the parasite, they typically do not show any symptoms, and this species may have been M. cerebralis original host.

40|$|Abstract. —Our {{goal was}} to assess the {{likelihood}} of hybridization between introduced rainbow <b>trout</b> Oncorhynchus mykiss and native Yellowstone (YS) cutthroat <b>trout</b> O. clarki bouvieri, based upon habitat use and temporal overlap during spawning. We used radio transmitters in 1996 and 1997 to describe the spawning behavior of rainbow <b>trout,</b> hybrids of rainbow <b>trout</b> and YS cutthroat <b>trout,</b> and YS cutthroat <b>trout</b> (1997 only). Fish displayed two distinct spawning strategies, either spawning in side channels of the main stem (9 rainbow <b>trout,</b> 14 hybrids, and 10 YS cutthroat <b>trout)</b> or in tributaries (5 rainbow <b>trout,</b> 3 hybrids, and 7 YS cutthroat <b>trout).</b> Within the main stem, the majority of rainbow <b>trout</b> and YS cutthroat <b>trout</b> migrated to the same 8 -km section to spawn, whereas hybrid <b>trout</b> spawned throughout the study site. The median spawning date for main-stem-spawning YS cutthroat <b>trout</b> (June 9) was significantly later than for rainbow <b>trout</b> (May 19) and hybrids (May 18). However, long spawning periods for rainbow <b>trout</b> (94 d), hybrids (113 d), and YS cutthroat <b>trout</b> (71 d) allowed for considerable overlap. The amount of spawning overlap varied among the four tributaries. In one tributary, complete spatial and some temporal overlap occurred (three rainbow <b>trout,</b> two hybrids, and two YS cutthroat trout); in another tributary no spatial or temporal overlap occurred (four rainbow <b>trout</b> and three YS cutthroat trout); an...|$|R
