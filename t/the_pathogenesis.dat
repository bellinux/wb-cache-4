5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
30|$|Although <b>the</b> exact <b>pathogenesis</b> of intermetatarsal {{bursitis}} is unclear, it {{is thought}} {{to be the result of}} chronic mechanical compression and irritation between the metatarsal heads, similar to <b>the</b> suspected <b>pathogenesis</b> of Morton’s neuroma [17].

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of BSE is {{not well}} {{understood}} or documented like other diseases of this nature. Even though BSE is a disease that results in neurological defects, its pathogenesis occurs in areas that reside outside of the nervous system. There was a strong deposition of PrPSc initially located in the Ileal Peyer’s patches of the small intestine. The lymphatic system has been identified in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of scrapies, it has not, however, been determined to be {{an essential part of}} <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of BSE. The Ileal Peyer’s patches have been the only organ from this system that has been found {{to play a major role}} in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis.</b> Infectivity of the Ileal Peyer's patches has been observed as early as 4 months after inoculation. PrPSc accumulation was found to occur mostly in tangible body macrophages of the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Tangible body macrophages involved in PrPSc clearance are thought to play a role in PrPSc accumulation in the Peyer’s patches. Accumulation of PrPSc was also found in follicular dendritic cells; however, it was of a lesser degree. Six months after inoculation, there was no infectivity in any tissues, only that of the ileum. This led researchers to believe that the disease agent replicates here. In naturally confirmed cases, there have been no reports of infectivity in the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Generally, in clinical experiments, high doses of the disease are administered. In natural cases, it was hypothesized that low doses of the agent were present, and therefore, infectivity could not be observed.|$|E
