Newman also wrote that the song's urban edge manifests Little Mix's growth and development. Gigwise's Andrew Trendell praised the track's production, writing, [...] "The skittering beats and little quirks of [...] 'DNA' make it instantly memorable." [...] Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail complimented the song's choral middle-eight, deeming it [...] "an inventive sonic flourish".

[...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single."

Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a bit harder than 'Wings'". He also added, [...] "it seems Little Mix have big aspirations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a lot longer than most of 's winners."
