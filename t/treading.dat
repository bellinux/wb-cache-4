40|$|Although it {{is likely}} that foveal {{information}} on <b>treads</b> provides important sensory cues for stair walking, it is unclear how gaze stabilization on <b>treads</b> contribute to gait control on stairs. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which (i) stair walking depends on foveal information on stepped <b>treads,</b> (ii) fixated <b>treads</b> correspond to future foot landing locations, and (iii) the distance looked ahead varies with stepping distance. Gaze and foot position was monitored from six healthy young adults when they ascended and descended a 10 <b>tread</b> long staircase, taking the stairs one or two <b>treads</b> at a time. The results showed that 55 - 68 % of the total fixation time was aimed at <b>treads,</b> and that <b>tread</b> edges were fixated more intensively during stair descent (69 % of the total time spent fixating <b>treads)</b> than during stair ascent (48 %). A substantial 28 - 34 % of the stepped <b>treads</b> was never fixated and, when the staircase was taken two <b>treads</b> a time, approximately 35 % of the fixated <b>treads</b> was never stepped on. Subjects fixated 3. 5 - 4. 5 <b>treads</b> ahead in both stepping conditions, but when the staircase was taken 2 <b>treads</b> a time, stepped <b>treads</b> were fixated shorter ahead (2. 7 - 2. 9 <b>treads)</b> than <b>treads</b> that were not stepped (3. 4 - 4. 1 <b>treads).</b> These results provide new insights into the visual control of stair walking, and suggest that the stabilization of gaze on <b>treads</b> is not used solely to guide foot placement, but may serve other purposes as well, e. g., to facilitate postural control on the staircase.

50|$|<b>Treads</b> fall {{somewhere along}} the {{spectrum}} from smooth or slick to knobby. Smooth <b>treads</b> are intended for on-road use, where a <b>tread</b> pattern offers no improvement in traction. However, many otherwise slick tires have a light <b>tread</b> pattern, due to the common belief that a slick tire will be slippery in wet conditions. Knobby <b>treads</b> are intended for off-road use, where the <b>tread</b> texture can help improve traction on soft surfaces. Many <b>treads</b> are omnidirectional—the tire can be installed in either orientation—but some are unidirectional and designed to be oriented a certain way. Some tires, especially for mountain bikes, have a <b>tread</b> which is intended either for the front wheel or the rear wheel. A special <b>tread</b> pattern, with small dimples, has been developed to reduce air drag.|$|R

5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While <b>treading</b> water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical {{examiner}} ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{moved to}} London {{to take up}} the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a {{position}} that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat <b>treading</b> on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.|$|E
5|$|This {{curtailment}} of governors' {{powers as}} the Emperors' representatives may have lessened the political dangers of an all-too-powerful class of Imperial delegates, {{but it also}} severely limited governors' ability to oppose local landed elites, specially those of senatorial status, which, although with reduced opportunities for office holding, retained wealth, social prestige, and personal connections. – specially in relatively peaceful regions without a great military presence. On one occasion, Diocletian had to exhort a proconsul of Africa not to fear the consequences of <b>treading</b> on the toes of the local magnates of senatorial rank. If a governor of senatorial rank himself felt these pressures, one can imagine the difficulties faced by a mere praeses. That accounts for the strained relationship between the central power and local elites: sometime during 303, an attempted military sedition in Seleucia Pieria and Antioch made Diocletian to extract a bloody retribution on both cities by putting to death a number of their council members for failing their duties of keeping order in their jurisdiction.|$|E
40|$|Wheel <b>treads</b> {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding. Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in <b>tread</b> profile which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale <b>tread</b> braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel <b>tread</b> profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and <b>tread</b> braking. The presented results show that the maximum <b>tread</b> depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel <b>tread</b> induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from <b>tread</b> braking. This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the <b>tread</b> near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other <b>tread</b> area...|$|R

5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after <b>treading</b> through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

25|$|While {{the basket}} press was {{becoming}} more widely used by Church owned estates in France and Germany, winemaking in the Iberian peninsula and by small local farmers throughout Europe was still mostly down by <b>treading</b> in stone lagers. However, there are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was probably due in part to added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus <b>treading.</b> But safety could have also been a driving force since many parish records from the period reported wine cellar works suffocating to death (from the released carbon dioxide) while <b>treading</b> fermenting wine grapes in a vat.|$|E

50|$|Tank <b>treads</b> - Numerous combat robots {{have used}} <b>treads</b> or belts {{in place of}} wheels {{in an attempt to}} gain {{additional}} traction. <b>Treads</b> are generally heavier and more vulnerable to damage than a wheeled system and offer no particular traction advantage on the types of surfaces common in robot combat. Most uses of <b>treads</b> are for their striking appearance.

5000|$|A non-zero {{slip angle}} arises because of {{deformation}} in the tire carcass and <b>tread.</b> As the tire rotates, the {{friction between the}} contact patch and the road results in individual <b>tread</b> 'elements' (finite sections of <b>tread)</b> remaining stationary {{with respect to the}} road. If a side-slip velocity u is introduced, the contact patch will be deformed. When a <b>tread</b> element enters the contact patch, the friction between the road and the tire causes the <b>tread</b> element to remain stationary, yet the tire continues to move laterally. Thus the <b>tread</b> element will be ‘deflected’ sideways. While it is equally valid to frame this as the tire/wheel being deflected away from the stationary <b>tread</b> element, convention is for the co-ordinate system to be fixed around the wheel mid-plane.|$|R
