60|$|They {{had been}} disarmed, {{so there was}} no help for it, and they walked through the ranch to where there was a big <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor.</b> This was raised up, {{disclosing}} a flight of wooden steps.|$|R
60|$|The lazarette was {{directly}} beneath the cabin, and, opening the <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> {{and carrying a}} candle with me, I dropped down and began overhauling the ship’s stores. I selected mainly from the canned goods, {{and by the time}} I was ready, willing hands were extended from above to receive what I passed up.|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke in}} a tone of {{decision}} that compelled obedience. Lifting a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> she bade her lover descend. He did so, and found himself in a cellar half full of lumber and with several casks ranged round the walls. The girl followed, removed one of the casks, and disclosed a hole behind it.|$|R
60|$|Goblin's finger is lifted; and she steals out again, {{into the}} Chapel of the Holy Office. She {{stops at a}} certain part of the flooring. Her great effect is at hand. She waits for the rest. She darts at the brave Courier, who is {{explaining}} something; hits him a sounding rap on the hat with the largest key; and bids him be silent. She assembles us all, round a little <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor,</b> as round a grave.|$|R
60|$|Nether-Moynton church-tower was, {{as in many}} villages, {{without a}} turret, {{and the only way}} to the top was by going up to the singers' gallery, and thence {{ascending}} by a ladder to a square <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> of the bell-loft, above which a permanent ladder was fixed, passing through the bells to a hole in the roof. When Lizzy and Stockdale reached the gallery and looked up, nothing but the trap-door and the five holes for the bell-ropes appeared. The ladder was gone.|$|R
60|$|I {{took off}} my shoes when I gained the {{forecastle}} head, and went noiselessly aft in my stocking feet. Nor did I call this time {{from the top of}} the companion-way. Cautiously descending, I found the cabin deserted. The door to his state-room was closed. At first I thought of knocking, then I remembered my ostensible errand and resolved to carry it out. Carefully avoiding noise, I lifted the <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> and set it to one side. The slop-chest, as well as the provisions, was stored in the lazarette, and I took advantage of the opportunity to lay in a stock of underclothing.|$|R
50|$|Deane re-imagined Dracula {{as a more}} urbane and theatrically {{acceptable}} {{character who}} could plausibly enter London society. It was Deane's idea that the count should wear a tuxedo and stand-up collar, and a flowing cape which concealed Dracula while he slipped through a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the stage <b>floor,</b> giving {{the impression that he}} had disappeared. Deane also arranged to have a uniformed nurse available at performances, ready to administer smelling salts should anyone faint.|$|R
60|$|Tommy's hens were at {{the bottom}} of the trouble, for if they had not persisted in laying so many eggs, he could not have sold them and made such sums. Money is the root of all evil, and yet it is such a useful root that we cannot get on without it any more than we can without potatoes. Tommy {{certainly}} could not, for he spent his income so recklessly, that Mr. Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savings-bank, and presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice, with the name over the door, and a tall chimney, down which the pennies were to go, there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor.</b>|$|R
50|$|VanDerBeek's ironic {{compositions}} {{were created}} {{very much in}} the spirit of the surreal and dadaist collages of Max Ernst, but with a wild, rough informality more akin to the expressionism of the Beat Generation. In the 1960s, VanDerBeek began working with the likes of Claes Oldenburg and Allan Kaprow, as well as representatives of modern dance, such as Merce Cunningham and Yvonne Rainer. Building his Movie Drome theater at Stony Point, New York, at just about the same time, he designed shows using multiple projectors. The Movie Drome was a grain silo dome which he turned into his ‘infinite projection screen’. Visitors entered the dome through a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor,</b> and were encouraged after entering to spread out over the floor and lie with their feet pointing towards the centre. Once inside, the audience experienced a dynamic inter-dispersal of movies and images around them, created by over a dozen slide and film projectors filling the concave surface with a dense collage of moving imagery. These presentations contained a very great number of random image sequences and continuities, with the result that none of the performances were alike.|$|R
60|$|No man of us {{ever knew}} that he was not being {{overlooked}} at home, or followed when he went out, by another man. Peepholes were pierced in the wall of each room, and we were never certain, while at work, whose eye was observing, or whose ear was listening in secret. Though we all lived together, we were probably the least united body of men ever assembled under one roof. By way of effectually keeping up the want of union between us, we were not all trusted alike. I soon discovered that Old File and Young File were much further advanced in the doctor's confidence than Mill, Screw, or myself. There was a locked-up room, and a continually-closed door shutting off a back staircase, of both of which Old File and Young File possessed keys that were never so much as trusted in the possession of the rest of us. There was also a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> of the principal workroom, the use of which was known to nobody but the doctor and his two privileged men. If we had not been all nearly on an equality in the matter of wages, these distinctions would have made bad blood among us. As it was, nobody having reason to complain of unjustly-diminished wages, nobody cared about any preferences in which profit was not involved.|$|R

60|$|We went on again, {{as soon as}} we {{had seen}} these things, and going over a rather bleak country (there had been nothing but vines until now: mere walking-sticks at that season of the year), stopped, as usual, between one and two hours {{in the middle of the}} day, to rest the horses; that being a part of every Vetturino contract. We then went on again, through a region {{gradually}} becoming bleaker and wilder, until it became as bare and desolate as any Scottish moors. Soon after dark, we halted for the night, at the osteria of La Scala: a perfectly lone house, where the family were sitting round a great fire in the kitchen, raised on a stone platform three or four feet high, and big enough for the roasting of an ox. On the upper, and only other floor of this hotel, there was a great, wild, rambling sala, with one very little window in a by-corner, and four black doors opening into four black bedrooms in various directions. To say nothing of another large black door, opening into another large black sala, with the staircase coming abruptly through a kind of <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor,</b> and the rafters of the roof looming above: a suspicious little press skulking in one obscure corner: and all the knives in the house lying about in various directions. The fireplace was of the purest Italian architecture, so that it was perfectly impossible to see it for the smoke. The waitress was like a dramatic brigand's wife, and wore the same style of dress upon her head. The dogs barked like mad; the echoes returned the compliments bestowed upon them; there was not another house within twelve miles; and things had a dreary, and rather a cut-throat, appearance.|$|R
60|$|By {{pointing}} to a small <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the ceiling, he rendered the question intelligible.|$|R
60|$|He {{seized a}} silken strap {{and opened a}} <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> {{the top of the}} platform.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be easy {{to hoist}} it up," [...] said the Captain, {{ignoring}} the remark, and eyeing the chest and <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the roof alternately.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{then you}} see, Berta,' Sol {{continued}} in the same earnest tone, and further exhibiting the article, 'I've made this <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the top with hinges and padlock complete, so that--' ...|$|R
6000|$|They were so {{packed in}} that he could {{scarcely}} reach gear lever and hand-brake. He halted on a level, and curtly asked, [...] "That <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> {{the back of the}} car--convertible extra seat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And honour to the Cuckoo too--why not?--for {{bursting}} {{out of the}} <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the Moorish Palace like a housebreaker, and hiccoughing twelve {{times on}} the assembled company, {{as if he had}} got drunk for joy! ...|$|R
60|$|He led the {{way into}} a wretchedly lighted by-street, and knocked with his foot on a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the pavement. The door was pushed open from below, by a sturdy boy with a dirty night-cap on his head.|$|R
60|$|Mounting the ladder, the missionary, {{instead of}} coming to a higher landing as he had expected, thrust his hat against a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the roof. Immediately he heard a savage human growl. Evidently the man was in a bad humour, but the missionary knocked.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a minute}} window looking out onto the courtyard, which opens onto a small room set between floors and is only {{accessible}} through a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> {{what is now a}} bathroom. It is possible that this may be a survival from the days of priest-hunting.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{room is a}} garret," [...] {{said the}} landlord. [...] "But there's a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the ceiling, leading out on to the roof--and a little lower down the street, there's an empty house under repair. Do you think, Sergeant, the blackguard has got off in that way, without paying?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had torn}} a rope {{from one of}} the old trunks, and hung himself on an iron hook {{immediately}} below the <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the ceiling--in the very place to which the eyes of his son, a lonely, desolate, little creature, had so often been directed in childish terror, fourteen years before.|$|R
500|$|Above the top {{lock the}} canal passes through Sydney Gardens {{including}} two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800.

60|$|He {{was on the}} move, however; and had his spasms, two to the second, {{all right}} and regular. But his sufferings when the clock was going to strike were frightful to behold; and when a Cuckoo looked out of a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the Palace, and gave note six times, it shook him, each time, like a {{spectral}} voice--or like a something wiry plucking at his legs.|$|R
2500|$|Above the top {{lock the}} canal passes through Sydney Gardens where {{it passes through}} two tunnels and under two cast iron {{footbridges}} dating from 1800.

6000|$|... "There is a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> that pantry," [...] {{explained}} the old sailor. [...] "The old man doesn't know of it. Some {{of the boys}} made it on the last trip, when we were carrying a lot of provisions, and the captain tried to cut down the rations. He saved one way but lost a good deal the other;" [...] and the old sailor laughed {{at the memory of}} the affair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quick! quick! {{into the}} loft!" [...] echoed his wife, and {{together}} they hurried me toward a ladder {{which led to a}} <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the ceiling. There was loud knocking at the door, so you can think that it was not long before my spurs went twinkling through the hole and the board was dropped behind me. An instant later I heard the voices of the Germans in the rooms below me.|$|R
60|$|Maimie craned forward eagerly {{to see how}} {{her friend}} fared, though she had really no hope; {{no one seemed to}} have the least hope except Brownie herself, who, however, was {{absolutely}} confident. She was led before his grace, and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart, which for convenience' sake was reached by a little <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> his diamond shirt, had begun to say mechanically, 'Cold, qui--,' when he stopped abruptly.|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} they had {{obtained}} another light, and pursued him closely along the back quarters of the mill. Bob had entered the lower room, seized hold of the chain by which the flour-sacks were hoisted from story to story by connexion with the mill-wheel, and pulled the rope that hung alongside {{for the purpose of}} throwing it into gear. The foremost pursuers arrived {{just in time to see}} Captain Bob's legs and shoe-buckles vanishing through the <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the joists overhead, his person having been whirled up by the machinery like any bag of flour, and the trap falling to behind him.|$|R
6000|$|A cold air, {{laden with}} an earthy smell, falls upon {{the face of}} Monsieur; for she has opened, while speaking, a <b>trap-door</b> <b>in</b> the wall. Monsieur looks in. Downward to the bottom, upward to the top, of a steep, dark, lofty tower: very dismal, very dark, very cold. The Executioner of the Inquisition, says Goblin, edging in her head to look down also, flung those who were past all further torturing, down here. 'But look! does Monsieur see the black stains on the wall?' A glance, over his shoulder, at Goblin's keen eye, shows Monsieur--and would {{without the aid of}} the {{directing}} key--where they are. 'What are they?' 'Blood!' ...|$|R
