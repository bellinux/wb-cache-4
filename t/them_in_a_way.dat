5|$|The {{red carpet}} premiere of Sense8 {{took place on}} May 27, 2015, in San Francisco's AMC Metreon, where the first three episodes were previewed. Starting {{in the middle of}} July 2015, Netflix Brazil {{released}} a series of documentary shorts called Sense8: Decoded. Inspired by Sense8 and directed by João Wainer, the shorts briefly touch upon subjects such as psychiatry, feminism, being transgender and buddhism. Later in the month, Netflix released a music track titled Brainwave Symphony on Spotify. To produce it they subjected eight strangers to a series of various stimuli and they recorded their individual brainwaves using EEG sensors. After extracting a melody from each of them they arranged <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to produce a track which mirrors the escalating action of the season. In early August 2015, Netflix made available Sense8: Creating the World, a half-hour web television documentary, shot around the world, about the making of season 1 of the series.|$|E

25|$|The Bible remains {{central to}} most Liberal Friends' worship, {{and almost all}} {{meetings}} make it available in the meeting house, (often {{on a table in}} the centre of the room), which attendees may read privately or publicly during worship. However, Liberal Friends, decided that the Scriptures should give way to God's leading, if God leads <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that is contrary to the Bible. Many Friends are also influenced by liberal Christian theologians, and modern Biblical criticism. They often adopt non-propositional Biblical hermeneutics, such as believing that the Bible is an anthology of human authors' beliefs and feelings about God, rather than Holy Writ, and that multiple interpretations of the Scriptures are acceptable.|$|E

500|$|To {{understand}} Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it {{is helpful}} to formulate <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in [...] "3+1" [...] formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the ADM formalism. These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always exist, and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified. Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.|$|E

While there, {{he spoke}} of his time with the Smashing Pumpkins {{as well as on}} the future of Digital Music at the Web Summit Centre Stage with Adrian Grenier, Chris Kaskie, and Brian Morrissey. He pointed to digital as the medium for artists to truly express themselves and create art that connects with their fans: [...] "Artists are looking for a destination ... digital gives them the opportunity to realize some of those destinations and package <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that allows them to be creative".|$|E
500|$|Realism {{and early}} modernist {{principles}} were applied in Britain {{to produce a}} critique of the conventional classical approach and the concept of a [...] "beautiful death", most notably by Charles Jagger. Jagger's later work during the inter-war period, most notably his Royal Artillery Memorial, uses realism techniques to portray an oversized BL 9.2 inch Mk I howitzer in detail, mounted on a huge, architecturally simple plinth with detailed carvings of military events involving ordinary artillerymen. The sheer size of the piece creates a dehumanizing impact, despite the portrayal of a team of artillerymen, including a covered corpse. Critiqued by much of the British press when unveiled in 1925, many veterans however felt that the style connected to <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that more classical themes could not. While the Royal Artillery Memorial is unique, elements of the style can be seen in some other memorials, such as the Cameronians Memorial which includes a realist, almost tactile depiction of a machine gun position.|$|E

500|$|... "Laser Beam" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was positive in his review, complimenting its composition and commercial appeal. Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the song {{on his personal}} blog, and was positive; he stated, [...] "...the new melodic additions put a cool spin on the song. Yasutaka chops and stutters the absolute shit out of the post chorus sections {{in a way which}} cements his position {{as one of the best}} knob twiddlers in the music biz right now. [...] "Laser Beam" [...] was a great song in May. It's still great now." [...] He identified it as an album highlight, and the album's best track. Ian Martin from The Japan Times was favorable in his review, stating, [...] "The chorus... of [...] "Laser Beam" [...] are great examples of classic Japanese pop, taking the sounds of 1970s kayōkyoku and 1980s technopop and updating <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that manages to be at once nostalgic and defiantly modern." [...] He identified it as one of the best tracks on the album.|$|E
500|$|Knights of the Old Republic II {{uses the}} same d20 System as the first Knights of the Old Republic with some changes, and the level cap has also been removed. For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design {{elements}} from the first game, as they {{felt that there was}} no need to change anything that had already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that retained the base style of Knights of the Old Republic. Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters. Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes. Knights of the Old Republic IIs lead artist was Aaron Meyers; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through [...] "tons of applications, resumes, and demo reels", and he said that he was pleased with the amount of people who wanted to work for Obsidian. Meyers also complained about the short deadline the development team had to deal with. Obsidian's COO, Chris Parker, said that the schedule set for the development team was [...] "extremely aggressive", and that the team felt a lot of pressure because they were [...] "making a sequel to the game of the year for 2003".|$|E

The tumultuous ovation at curtain proved that Jolson was not merely the right man for the part of Jackie Rabinowitz, alias Jack Robin; he was the right man for the entire transition from silent fantasy to talking realism. The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{least part}} of the reason for this was due to the industry's system of censorship. Black writes, [...] "as Mankiewicz, Selznick, and Hecht knew all too well, much of the blame for the failure of the movies to deal more frankly and {{honestly}} with life, lay with a rigid censorship imposed on the industry [...] [...] [...] [...] on the content of films during its golden era of studio production." [...] Because the costs of production and distribution were so high, the primary [...] "goal of the studios was profit, not art[...] [...] fearful of losing any segment of their audiences, the studios either carefully avoided controversial topics or presented <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that evaded larger issues", thereby creating only 'harmless entertainment'".|$|E

2500|$|Peter Kandunias of Gigwise praised Rihanna's and West's vocals {{as well as}} McCartney's instrumentation.

[...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News stated that this collaboration {{is better than the}} previous West-McCartney collaboration. Additionally, he praised Rihanna's vocals and stated that they are a lot better than West's, [...] "who could have used more auto-tune to firm his unsteady vocals". Farber further noted: [...] "It's refreshing to hear Rihanna sing with so little affect, in a setting that's much less processed than most of her recordings". Voxs Kelsey McKinney noted that [...] "Rihanna's voice shows significant growth in range and tone since her last album". She adds that Rihanna's performance in the opening of the song is [...] "more vulnerable than we've heard Rihanna since 2012's 'Stay', and hints that her new album may contain more confessional slow jams like this one".|$|E

2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, {{and that there were}} many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
