Bewkes told the newspaper, [...] "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the word I don't think so." [...] At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added [...] "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close." [...] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that [...] "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure.

2500|$|As Clarissa {{prepares for}} the party she thinks of the famous actor Sally is lunching with, a B-movie action star who {{recently}} came out as gay. This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is [...] "only a wife" [...] (p94). Clarissa tries {{to be grateful for}} the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95). She thinks of kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. [...] "It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." ...|$|E

A sort of awe crept over us, to think how that untaught girl, taken {{suddenly}} and unprepared, was yet able to penetrate the cunning devices of a King's trained advisers and defeat them. Marveling over this, and astonished at it, we fell silent and spoke no more. We {{had come to know}} that she was great in courage, fortitude, endurance, patience, conviction, fidelity to all dutiesin all things, indeed, that make a good and trusty soldier and perfect him for his post; now we were beginning to feel <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> were greatnesses in her brain that were even greater than these great qualities of the heart.

60|$|We jogged along happily enough {{through the}} loveliest country that ever I set my eyes on, until {{we came to}} the great city, where we thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> would be a battle, for there are so many folk in it that if only one in twenty comes out it would make a fine army. But by that time they had seen that it was a pity to spoil the whole country {{just for the sake of}} one man, and so they had told him that he must shift for himself in the future. The next we heard was that he had {{surrendered}} to the British, and that the gates of Paris were opened to us, which was very good news to me, for I could get along very well just on the one battle that I had had.|$|E
60|$|So Sir Launcelot {{made his}} way toward Corbin, and he {{travelled}} thitherward several days and God alone knows how he did so. And one morning at {{the breaking of the}} day he came to the town of Corbin, and he entered the town by a postern gate he knew of old. And after he had entered the town he {{made his way}} slowly and with great pain up through the streets of the town and the town was still asleep. So he came unseen to the market-place of Corbin where he had aforetime slain the Worm of Corbin as aforetold, and there sat him down upon that slab of stone beneath which the Worm had made its habitation. And why he came there who shall say except <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> lay very dimly within his mind some remembrance that here he had one time had great honor and glory of knighthood.|$|E

40|$|The study investigates {{learning}} spillovers {{from local}} firms {{as well as}} MNEs in China, and their indirect effects on other firms’ exporting, paying particular attention to inter- and intra-industry spillovers. We develop a synthetic model based on the treatment of spillovers in economics, geography and international business, testing four different spillover effects, measured by export propensity and intensity of local Chinese firms associated with four types of export agglomeration. We find significant, positive spillovers effects. Surprisingly, spillovers transmitted from locally-owned exporters to local firms {{turn out to be}} stronger than those from foreign-owned exporters to local firms. Unsurprisingly, spillovers transmitted within the same industry are stronger than with different industries. The evidence suggests that after 30 years of openness to international trade and export-oriented development, China’s indigenous firms have started to make a significant contribution to the export performance of other local firms. This finding is different from findings from previous empirical analysis, which reveals <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>there’s</b> a diminishing teaching effects from foreign MNEs to local firms...|$|R

When asked {{about the possibility of}} returning for the final episode of the series, in a similar manner to Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar in Star Trek: The Next Generation, she said that [...] "I never know where I'll be or what I'm going to be doing at that point in time, however I do know that the show will grow. The show is going to grow without the character that I portrayed on it. So wherever it happens to be toward the culmination of the show, it will be at a point where character may not be necessary or required. In that case the character won't be {{an important part of the}} story and therefore will not be needed. So yes, I could see not doing it. I could see not being asked back.

Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me.

25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> tomorrow <b>there</b> will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|R
