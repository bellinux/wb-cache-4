50|$|<b>Tournament</b> <b>sort</b> is a sorting algorithm. It {{improves}} {{upon the}} naive selection sort {{by using a}} priority queue to find the next element in the sort. In the naive selection sort, it takes O(n) operations to select the next element of n elements; in a <b>tournament</b> <b>sort,</b> it takes O(log n) operations (after building the initial tournament in O(n)). <b>Tournament</b> <b>sort</b> is a variation of heapsort.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is an implementation of <b>tournament</b> <b>sort</b> in Haskell, based on Scheme code by Stepanov and Kershenbaum.|$|E

5000|$|Ultimate Brazil {{was part}} one {{of what the}} UFC called [...] "The Road To The Heavyweight Title" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the event of the same name), a <b>tournament</b> of <b>sorts,</b> spanning four events, to crown the new UFC Heavyweight Champion following Randy Couture's relinquishing of the belt.|$|R
2500|$|In October and November 2004, Taguchi {{competed in}} the 7-man, single-elimination Young Lion Toukon <b>Tournament,</b> a <b>sort</b> of [...] "sequel" [...] to the Young Lion Cup; he {{received}} a bye to the semifinals {{as a result of}} winning that tournament, defeating Hiroshi Nagao and Katsuhiko Nakajima in his two matches to punctuate his YLC victory.|$|R
5000|$|UFC 19 {{was part}} three {{of what the}} UFC called [...] "The Road To The Heavyweight Title", a four-part <b>tournament</b> of <b>sorts,</b> held to {{determine}} the Heavyweight Champion after the title was vacated by Randy Couture. It was determined that the winner of Kevin Randleman vs. Maurice Smith would face Bas Rutten at UFC 20 for the Undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship Title.|$|R
5000|$|UFC 20 was {{the final}} event of what the UFC called [...] "The Road to the Heavyweight Title", a <b>tournament</b> of <b>sorts</b> {{spanning}} four events, held to determine the Heavyweight Champion after Randy Couture vacated the title (due to contract disputes with the UFC). Bas Rutten defeated Kevin Randleman to become the new Heavyweight Champion in a controversial split decision.|$|R
50|$|The 1984 International Wrestling Grand Prix {{ran from}} May 11 to June 14, 1984. The tournament {{featured}} 12 wrestlers, {{and was the}} first time that the <b>tournament</b> featured no <b>sort</b> of final round.|$|R

25|$|Rutten was {{originally}} scheduled to fight heavyweight champion Randy Couture in a title {{match for the}} UFC Heavyweight Championship in his first fight, but Couture had a contract dispute and left the UFC to sign with a different promotion. The title was then stripped from Couture and a <b>tournament</b> of <b>sorts</b> {{was set up to}} determine the next champion. Thus, the Dutchman's first fight in his quest for the UFC belt was against Fighting Network RINGS exponent Tsuyoshi Kohsaka at UFC 18. During the bout, Rutten was repeatedly taken down and struck with ground and pound, but he ended up scoring a dramatic KO with just a minute left in overtime. The fight was a source of controversy because referee John McCarthy seemed to unfairly stand the fight up when Kohsaka was mounted on Rutten and actively landing clean effective punches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{arrangements}} for the 1919 <b>tournament</b> were <b>sorted</b> out at a late stage. In mid-July {{it was decided that}} the number of qualifiers for the final stage would be increased from 32 to 64 and the [...] "News of the World" [...] agreed to increase the prize money. The West of England section had already played their qualifying competition under the impression there were 2 places available. They were allocated 4 in the new system. Other sections were allocated the following places: Southern 26, Northern 12, Midland 10, Scotland 5, Welsh 4, Eastern 2 and Irish 1. The tournament was extended to a fourth day with the 32 18-hole first round matches played on the first day. The losing quarter-finalists received £12 10s, third round losers £10, second round losers £7 10s and first round losers £5. Prize money totalled £590.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the tournament incentives of pension fund managers and the characteristics of equities they choose to hold. Using a comprehensive data set on pension fund portfolio holdings, we determine the intensity of fund manager <b>tournaments</b> by <b>sorting</b> pension funds into portfolios {{based on the number of}} concurrent managers each pension fund employs. We then investigate which corporate characteristics are preferred by each of these portfolios by estimating share selection models that include a range of corporate characteristics that are expected to shape the returns to investment in stocks over the short and long run. We find that the intensity of the tournament faced by fund managers plays a significant role in shaping preferences over corporate characteristics. Managers facing more intense tournaments exhibit significantly weaker preferences for attributes associated with long run payoffs, such as social performance and growth potential, and significantly stronger preferences for short term attributes, such as operational efficiency, when compared to managers that face weak or no tournament incentives...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{prevalence}} of compensation systems which reward winners without explicitly identifying losers can be rationalized by workers' concern for relative payo¤s. If the workers' participation constraints are binding, the rm must compensate its employees for the disutility that they may derive from low status. It follows that prot-maximizing employers may be particularly reluctant to penalize or give poor performance evaluation to employees. The theory also sheds light on many other puzzling features of incentive schemes in practice, such as small salary premia, rat races, job title proliferation, the gender wage gap, the gender/happiness paradox and {{the widespread use of}} <b>tournaments</b> as a <b>sorting</b> device...|$|R
40|$|A {{tournament is}} a digraph {{in which every}} pair of {{vertices}} is connected by exactly one arc. The score list of a <b>tournament</b> is the <b>sorted</b> list of the out-degrees of its vertices. Given a non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integers, is it the score list of some tournament? There is a simple test for answering this question. There is also a simple sequen-tial algorithm for constructing a tournament with a given score list. However, this algorithm has a greedy nature, and seems hard to paral-lelize. We present a simple parallel algorithm for the construction problem. Our algorithm runs in time O(logn) and uses 0 (n 2 /logn) pro-cessors on a CREW PRAM, where n {{is the number of}} vertices. Since the size of the output is 8 (n 2), our algorithm achieves optimal speedup...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tournament</b> {{replacement}} selection <b>sorts</b> {{are used}} to gather the initial runs for external sorting algorithms. Conceptually, an external file is read and its elements are pushed into the priority queue until the queue is full. Then the minimum element is pulled from the queue and written {{as part of the}} first run. The next input element is read and pushed into the queue, and the min is selected again and added to the run. There's a small trick that if the new element being pushed into the queue is less than the last element added to the run, then the element's sort value is increased so it {{will be part of the}} next run. On average, a run will be 100% longer than the capacity of the priority queue.|$|R

50|$|Jamie {{played the}} Brisbane and Sydney tournaments with Serbian Dušan Vemić but played the Australian Open {{with his old}} partner Eric Butorac as Vemić was unavailable. Butorac and Murray, who had not played {{together}} since the 2007 US Open, lost {{in the first round}} at Melbourne Park. Since splitting from Vemić at the end of February, Murray played with several different partners, including Simon Aspelin, Jamie Delgado, Paul Hanley, Pavel Vízner, Gilles Müller and Jonathan Erlich. With Müller he reached the semi-final at Nottingham, his best result since the same tournament last year.Murray played with Vízner at the French Open and with Erlich at Wimbledon, but was defeated {{in the first round of}} both tournaments. However, he did reach the semi-finals of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon with his regular partner Liezel Huber. Dropping out of the world top one hundred, Murray returned to the Challenger circuit with new partner Jamie Delgado. Playing in these lower ranked tournaments, he won his first <b>tournament</b> of any <b>sort</b> in eighteen months at the Tirani Cup in August 2009, followed by wins at the TEAN International (with Jonathan Marray) and the Ljubljana Open. He was a semi-finalist in the Challenger event in Orléans, France. He topped off the year with a win in Astana, Kazakhstan again partnering Jonathan Marray.|$|R
