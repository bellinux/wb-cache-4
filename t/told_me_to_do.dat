Eichmann asked Grüber in a meeting about Jewish emigration why Grüber, not having any Jewish family and with no prospect for any thank, does help the Jews. Grüber answered because the Good Samaritan did so, and my Lord <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train {{with some of the}} best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
500|$|Even {{to the end}} of his life, Speer {{continued}} to question his actions under Hitler. In his final book, Infiltration, he asks, [...] "What would have happened if Hitler had asked me to make decisions that required the utmost hardness?... How far would I have gone?... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so?" [...] Speer leaves the questions unanswered.|$|E

He got {{a degree in}} animal nutrition from Iowa, worked as a builder, produced rodeos, staged and performed Western music jamborees, and worked as an advertising manager for a radio station from 1962 onwards. Holt later said of this period:Do you {{realize that this is}} the first time in my life that I can make my own decisions and do what I want <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> First it was my parents who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> then RKO <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> then I went into the service and Uncle Sam <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I came back out and RKO still <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This is the first time I have not been under somebody's thumb in my life.http://comicvine.gamespot.com/red-mask/4005-1345/ ...|$|R

500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

I then went on holiday, and my agent at the time, Ambrose Mendy, said it wasn't worth me coming back to do a picture in a United shirt when the deal was completed, so I should do one before I left, {{and it would be}} {{released}} when the deal was announced. Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his {{assigned}} work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: Jesse Anderson and Christopher Scarver. The trio was left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20minutes. At approximately 8:10a.m. Dahmer was discovered {{on the floor of}} the bathrooms of the gym suffering from extreme head and facial wounds; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a 20-inch (51cm) metal bar. His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault. Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had also been beaten with the same instrument, and died two days later from his wounds. Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as he (Dahmer) was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as he (Anderson) cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: [...] "God <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead." [...] Scarver was adamant he had not planned the attacks in advance, although he would later divulge to investigators he had concealed the 20-inch iron bar used to kill both men in his clothing shortly before the killings.|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth {{started out}} his {{season with a}} {{promising}} race in the Daytona 500. He led 40 laps in the waning stages in the race. He took the white flag to start the final lap, but was passed by teammate Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex, Jr.. Kenseth's attempt at blocking backfired as he went sideways and lost several positions. Kenseth finished 14th while Hamlin edged Truex to the stripe to win the closest finish in the race's history. One week later in the Atlanta race, he was tagged for [...] "improper fueling" [...] during a green flag pit stop {{and was forced to}} serve a pass-through penalty. He was given the black flag with the white cross marks for not pitting within three laps. After serving that penalty, he ended up in 31st two-laps down. After the race, he said [...] "I got black-flagged for some type of pit road penalty and I didn’t know it and pitted the lap they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a pass through – I'm assuming they were black flagging us before that and they pulled our card. I never heard anything about it or at least saw the flag or anything, so I came when they told me to come and I guess they must have penalized us a couple laps or something. I don’t really know. I haven’t really seen it.” However, Kenseth did go on to finish 19th. He finished 37th at Las Vegas after being involved in a multi-car wreck with Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, and Carl Edwards late in the race.|$|E

60|$|The {{first thing}} that {{surprised}} me was, that although I had seen nine men ascend the three stairs and enter the room, there was now, besides myself and Hirsch, only one other person present.

He was a young man, fair and well built, and as obviously a soldier as though he were wearing his uniform. His clothes were well cut, his hands shapely and white.
