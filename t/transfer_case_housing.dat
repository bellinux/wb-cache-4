50|$|For the 1988 model year, the Pontiac Division of GM {{utilized}} a THM 125C {{modified to}} accommodate a full-time All-Wheel-Drive planetary gear <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and output <b>housing</b> to send 40% of the output torque to the rear wheels in the 3.1 liter powered 6000STE. While a similar design {{was used for the}} later 4T65E, the three speed design was utilized for only two model years, after which all-wheel drive was discontinued as an option for the carline.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1998, Mitsubishi {{issued a}} recall (bulletin 98V069001) for all 1990-1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing, [...] "Lockup of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> can occur due to {{insufficient}} lubrication. The condition {{can cause a}} loss of vehicle control increasing {{the risk of a}} crash." [...] The dealers would inspect the vehicles for adequacy of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil volume, <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil leakage, and operational degradation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> mechanism. The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> itself did not leak but rather the brass plug {{in the center of the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> yoke would leak. Mitsubishi estimated 24,275 vehicles were affected.|$|R
50|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> was a New Venture 271 {{and had a}} 2.72:1 {{low range}} gear ratio. A <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> skid plate was and is {{standard}} equipment. A manual shift-on-the-fly <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is the only available, the electronic shift on-the-fly has never been an option. As of the 2012 model year, the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> has changed to a Borg-Warner 44-47 manual shift-on-the fly. Low range is now 2.64:1.|$|R
5000|$|The 2G Eclipse {{received}} numerous Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) affecting {{a variety}} of issues with the car however there was one notable powertrain recall. In March 1998, Mitsubishi issued a recall (bulletin 98V069001) for all 1990-1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing, [...] "Lockup of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> can occur due to insufficient lubrication. The condition can cause a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk of a crash." [...] The dealers would inspect the vehicles for adequacy of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil volume, <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil leakage, and operational degradation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> mechanism. The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> itself did not leak but rather the brass plug {{in the center of the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> yoke would leak. Mitsubishi estimated 24,275 vehicles were affected.|$|R
50|$|A {{divorced}} {{or independent}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is completely {{separate from the}} transmission. It is located further down the driveline than a married <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and connected to the transmission output shaft by a short driveshaft. Independent <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks.|$|R
50|$|The Quadra-Trac name {{is used on}} {{a variety}} of {{full-time}} 4WD systems. The first version used the Borg-Warner BW1339 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and was produced from 1973 to 1979. The next version used the New Process NP219 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and was produced from 1980 to 1982. From 1993 to 1995 the New Process NP249 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> carried the name. And from 1996 to 1998 the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> was manufactured by New Venture Gear with some minor improvements and it was renamed the NV249.|$|R
5000|$|... lowered gearing {{in either}} {{or all of}} the transmission, <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> (including often {{employing}} a second <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to reduce gearing even more), or axle differentials ...|$|R
50|$|Selec-Trac II uses a console mounted {{switch to}} control the MP3022 <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The switch {{controls}} the 4WD mode with options of 2WD - 4WD Auto - N - 4WD Low. The MP3022 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> uses an electronically controlled clutch pack to bias torque from 100% rear to 50/50% front/rear. The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> has no center differential, so power can only be supplied to the front axle when the rear wheels begin to slip. In this way, the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> works almost identically to the NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> used in the Quadra-Trac II system in 1999 to 2004 WJ Jeep Grand Cherokees. In 4WD Low mode, the clutch pack is locked and power flows through a 2.72:1 planetary gear set for higher torque at lower speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{wheel drive}} Explorers receive a new {{electronic}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> selection knob {{on the dash}} no longer has a [...] "2WD" [...] option, being replaced with [...] "Auto".|$|R
50|$|New Process <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are {{chain-driven}} and use {{a circular}} 6 bolt, 23-spline input on the case. The output for the front drive shaft {{is on the left}} side. The New Process <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> used by AMC attach the same as the Dana 300 except that New Process cases have the front output on the left side. Interchange ('flip') is possible, but there is an indexing lug in the pattern, in an attempt to allow the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to attach in only one position. Thus, some modification on the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> or the adapter is required.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 Jeep {{replaced}} the New Venture Gear NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> with the NV245 <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> This <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{actually has a}} center differential, allowing both {{the front and rear}} axles to have power supplied to them without driveline binding, even on dry pavement. The torque distribution under normal driving conditions (no tire slippage) is 48% front and 52% rear. There is also an electronically controlled variable lockup clutch pack that can apply progressive 0 to 100% locking across the center differential. This is the improvement over the Selec-Trac NV242 <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> as that system has only fully unlocked and fully locked settings and requires manual shifting between them. And finally, the NV245 has the 'N' and '4WD Low' modes which act {{in the same manner as}} in the NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> above.|$|R
50|$|Chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> use a {{chain to}} drive most often only one axle, but can drive both axles. Chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones. They {{are used in}} {{vehicles}} such as compact trucks, full size trucks, Jeeps and SUVs. Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases,</b> accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>cases</b> {{are also}} {{classified}} as either [...] "divorced"/independent or [...] "married". Married <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are bolted {{directly to the}} transmission, usually between the transmission's output shaft and the rear or main driveshaft. Sometimes a married <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{is an integral part}} of the transmission and the two components share the same housing or [...] "case", as is commonly found on recent Subaru products and some other all-wheel-drive cars.|$|R
50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front {{differential}}, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The transmission, front differential, center differential and <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|R
50|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is an {{auxiliary}} transmission {{that connects the}} front and rear axles. It also commonly provides a selectable secondary gear reduction. AMC and Jeep vehicles have used several different <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> in their various models.|$|R
50|$|Since the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator {{no longer}} {{uses the same}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> as the Expedition. Expedition four-wheel drives {{continue}} to use a two-speed dual range <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> with off-road low range reduction gearing and default off-road program that remaps (reprograms) the electronic throttle control and traction control system response for off-road conditions. Navigator four-wheel drives have been demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> which lacks low range gearing.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{receives}} {{power from}} the transmission and sends it to both {{the front and rear}} axles. This can be done with gears, hydraulics, or chain drive. On some vehicles, such as four-wheel-drive trucks or vehicles intended for off-road use, this feature is controlled by the driver. The driver can put the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> into either [...] "two-wheel-drive" [...] or [...] "four-wheel-drive" [...] mode. This is sometimes accomplished by means of a shifter, similar to that in a manual transmission. On some vehicles this may be electronically operated by a switch instead. Some vehicles, such as all-wheel-drive sports cars, have <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> that are not selectable. Such a <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is permanently [...] "locked" [...] into all-wheel-drive mode.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973-1980 Blazers {{used the}} gear-driven {{part-time}} NP-205 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> (mostly mated to the SM465 manual transmission and some TH350s) or the chain-driven full-time NP-203 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> (mated to the TH350 automatic) and DANA-44 front/12-bolt rear axle combination through 1980. Starting in 1981 used the chain-driven NP208 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> (NP241 after 1988) with front 10-bolt/rear 10-bolt axle combinations until 1991. There is an overlap of 12-bolt rears {{into the early}} '80s, while the 10-bolt front axle was phased into production in the late 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|On 4x4 models {{there is}} a choice of a manual {{chain-driven}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> floor shifter with manual front locking hubs or Electronic-Shift-On-the-Fly (ESOF, a $185 option over the manual) dash knob with vacuum activated automatic and (in case of failure) manual override front hubs. The optional FX4 models are basically a standard 4x4 with an Off Road package that includes a few extras like upgraded heavy duty Rancho shocks, limited-slip rear differential, added skid plates for the fuel tank and <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> and two [...] "FX4" [...] decals on both back bed-sides instead of the standard [...] "4x4". For all 4x4 models, the 2-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> 4x4-LOW range has a gear reduction of 2.72:1. Brazilian and Venezuelan versions had only the ESOF <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Command-Trac HD <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{was used}} in 6-speed Liberty KJ's from 2005 to 2007. Although {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "NV(NP)231HD," [...] the <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are actually the 241 series used in full-sized trucks from other makers (241D or 241C). The Jeep version is labelled [...] "NV(NP)241J." [...] This is not the NV241OR <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> found in the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, which uses a 4.0 low range and has a reinforced case. Dodge uses a 241DHD, which has a reinforced case but the 2.72 low-range.|$|R
50|$|In North America the Hilux saw {{the use of}} four-wheel drive. It had a solid {{front axle}} and leaf suspension. The body saw a {{redesign}} that included single round headlights and a less complex body. This new 4WD setup featured a gear driven RF1A <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> This <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is unique in that its low-range reduction portion can be replicated, using what some refer to as a dual or triple <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> This results in a much lower overall gear ratio. It was the first Hilux available with an automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|... 4-Wheel drive truck {{applications}} for the THM350 used an iron adapter that mated the THM-350 to the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> directly, similar to the THM400. The THM350 adapter was cast iron and used a sliding sleeve to couple the transmission output shaft to the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> input shaft with a steel coupler sleeve that was splined to accept both shafts and couple them together. An internal snap ring inside the coupler sleeve controlled the sleeve's position on the shafts, with circular seals in the adapter sealing the transmission from the <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In May 2013 {{there was}} a recall of WKs with the Quadra-Drive II and Quadra-Trac II systems. This {{followed}} cases of cars rolling away due the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> moving into neutral of its own accord, and the owner not having applied the parking brake. The recall revised the Final Drive Control Module (FDCM) software. However, following the recall there were widespread reports on enthusiast web sites [...] of both the neutral and low ratio modes of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> ceasing to function, and a survey showed that fewer than 10% of respondents had experienced no issues with the recall. Attempting to resolve these issues, some dealers subsequently replaced the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> actuator, FDCM, and even the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> itself, often at customer expense and usually to no avail.|$|R

5000|$|Quadra-Trac II was {{introduced}} in 1999 and it employs a two-speed chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> featuring three modes of operation, [...] "4-All Time", [...] "N" [...] or neutral, and [...] "4-Lo". Two different <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> were used, the NV247 in 1999-2004 WJs and the NV245 in 2005-2010 WKs and 2006-2009 XKs.|$|R
50|$|A notable feature {{available}} in this generation was the automatic {{four wheel drive}} option called Quadra-Drive, which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> This two-speed chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> uses a gerotor, a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between {{the front and rear}} axles. The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels {{on either side of the}} axle. The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo. The Quadra-Trac II system included the NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> with the standard open front and rear differentials.|$|R
