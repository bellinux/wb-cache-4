Using the gravity model, we find that home bias remains substantial for products where the EU has sought to introduce harmonized technical regulations to remove <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade but mutual recognition sectors exhibit the smallest home bias. Based upon the analysis on the evolution of home bias in the EU, we find no evidence that the home bias has decreased for products where differences in technical regulations are important. home bias, gravity model, European integration, <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade...|$|R

It is a difficult conceptual and empirical subject that will not be settled soon. Recently, trade policy economists have noted that appropriate treatment of <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> in trade policy modelling may be of growing importance. One standard argument is that, as other non-tariff barriers in agriculture are eliminated and as tariffs are reduced, the relative (and perhaps absolute) importance of <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> is increased (Josling 1994; Sumner 1995 b). Among the most important <b>technical</b> trade <b>barriers</b> are those relating to sanitary and phytosanitary [SPS] and food safety concerns. These were dealt with in several places in recent trade agreements. The agriculture provisions of the Uruguay Round trade agreements [URA] reduced the scope for non-tariff barriers and lowered tariffs. The provisions found in the Uruguay Round "Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures " and the "Agreement on <b>Technical</b> <b>Barriers</b> to Trade " require that import restrictions based on SPS claims be more consistent with science and that <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> in general be less arbitrary...|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} two important facets of current debates concerning trade policy and trade modelling: {{the importance of}} estimated border effects {{and the impact of}} <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade. Here we try and identify the effect of <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> on the imports of EU countries by estimating gravity equations applied to data in which sectors are grouped according to the approach adopted by the EU to the removal of <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> (New Approach, Old Approach, mutual recognition) as well as an aggregate of sectors for which <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> are deemed to be unimportant. Our results suggest substantial border effects for all groups of sectors except for those subject to mutual recognition. The border effect is mitigated but remains considerable against trade with EU partners. High and persistent border effects are found for sectors where <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> are not important suggesting that factors other than policy-induced barriers are important determinants of the intensity of internal relative to external trade flows. The paper discusses the interpretation of these border effects in the context of measuring the extent of economic integration and argues that more information on the nature of preferences and on factors promoting local networks of buyers and suppliers is required before we can proceed to examine the policy implications...|$|R

As Lord Beaverbrook said, [...] "Chamberlain wanted Halifax. Labour wanted Halifax. Sinclair wanted Halifax. The Lords wanted Halifax. The King wanted Halifax. And Halifax wanted Halifax."

A very common fabrication process for X-ray gratings is LIGA, which involves several of the microfabrication techniques mentioned above and was invented in the 1980s by German scientists of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).Another technical requirement is the stability, and precise alignment and movement of the gratings (typically {{in the range of}} some nm), but compared to other methods, e.g. the crystal interferometer the constraint is easy to fulfill.The grating fabrication challenge was eased by the discovery of a phase moiré effect which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic far-field interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are easier to make when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the grating depth required to cause phase shift is much less than what is needed to absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in table-top PFI imagers. In PFI a phase grating is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase moiré effect. Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller grating periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one grating period.|$|E

50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} <b>technical</b> <b>barrier</b> to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|E
