5|$|The United States {{government}} agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>compensation</b> for {{the damaged}} property {{but not for}} the actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E

5|$|Nikola of Hodimir and Pribislav of Malduč claimed bail in May 1239 for the Omišani {{who murdered}} Dubrovnik nobleman Grubeša and looted his ship. They also agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>compensation</b> for {{personal}} property {{that had been}} looted. In Omiš during the same year, knez Nikola and his relatives made peace between Zachlumia and Split, agreeing to pay for damage {{earlier in the year}} when Malduš nephew Toljen ravaged Split. However, compensation for the ravages of Toljen was not paid, leading to conflict in the following year. After an unsuccessful attack on Omiš, the Split army captured Brač {{in the first half of}} 1240. The conflict continued until the peace agreement by which the brothers of Osor left the ships to Split and renounced looting. This was also the time period of the Split potestas Gargano, and Malduč sons Pribislav and Osor in Hvar and Brač.|$|E
5|$|In general, the USACE {{credited}} existing {{flood control}} projects as preventing additional flooding. In West Virginia alone, {{it was estimated}} that existing flood-control projects saved about $135million in damage. Lake Moomaw in western Virginia helped prevent $70million in damage along the James River. In Pennsylvania, flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River. After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning, the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November21, 1985, against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages. The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam. The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986, citing the Federal Power Act's provision that claims should be in the District Court, but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas, bringing it to trial in September 1989. The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent, the damage was caused mainly by the historic and unprecedented flooding; consequently, the case entered a compulsory nonsuit, meaning the company was not required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>compensation.</b> The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990, which was denied.|$|E
