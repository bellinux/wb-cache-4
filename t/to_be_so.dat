5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> {{important to the}} war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected {{to take on the}} $130,000,000 Merlin order.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> severe.|$|E
5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle.

The leek went on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Cory {{served as}} the film's main director, as he had more {{experience}} with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director.

Tony Leech, {{who had worked with}} the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe, was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well.

5|$|Eight {{months were}} spent {{scouting}} locations, including Ireland, China and Argentina, before New Zealand, Prague, Slovenia and Poland were chosen. Whereas the previous film was predominantly shot in New Zealand {{with a few}} months of filming in Central Europe, Adamson decided New Zealand lacked enough sound stages to accommodate the larger scale of the film. The decision to film most of the picture in Europe also allowed the ability to shoot during summer in both continents, although the weather turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> erratic during filming that Adamson joked he had been lied to.|$|E
