The minimum number of colors used to color a graph with an ℓ-distance-edge-coloring is called the ℓ-chromatic index. Solving the ℓ-distance-edge-coloring problem is different from determining the chromatic index, by Vizing's theorem, for its power graph. The ℓ-distance-edge-coloring is thus an original problem which is NP-hard in general. We study the ℓ-distance-edge-coloring problem in some classes <b>of</b> <b>graphs</b> {{in order to bring}} a new insight on the relative difficulties of this problem.
