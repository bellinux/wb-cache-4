500|$|As {{of the end}} of this episode, {{the status}} of three main {{characters}} remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying [...] "we've given the audience {{no reason to believe that}} Adam can figure a way to get out of there. The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> at least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here." [...] Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to hurt people. Kring says [...] "she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the sound of that word 'hero'." [...] Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, [...] "Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes." [...] Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production.|$|E
2500|$|Among authors, Roald Dahl was scathing {{and called}} Rushdie's book sensationalist and Rushdie [...] "a {{dangerous}} opportunist". John le Carr√© thought {{the death sentence}} to be outrageous, but he also criticised Rushdie's action: [...] "I don't think [...] it is given <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to be impertinent to great religions with impunity", although he later expressed regret over his dispute with Rushdie. Rushdie however was supported by major bodies in the literary world such as PEN and Association of American Publishers, and prominent figures such as Gunter Grass, Martin Amis, Saul Bellow, Nadine Gordimer and Derek Walcott. Another major supporter of Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens, said that the fatwa persuaded him that Islamic fundamentalism was an urgent menace, and later wrote God Is Not Great, a polemic against religion. The affair however led to greater caution and some degree of self-censorship when dealing with Islamic issues in the literary and other creative arts.|$|E

6000|$|... "As fair {{to him as}} to us. For, don't you see, it wouldn't belong <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> It would {{belong to}} the friends or {{the family of the}} man who lost it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{unlikely}} things, madam, {{are happening}} every hour," [...] the detective remarked. [...] "The world--our little corner <b>of</b> it, at <b>any</b> rate--is full <b>of</b> anomalies. There might even {{come a time}} <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> three when liberty was more dangerous than the prison cell itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also spoke}} out against reform of anti-homosexual laws, once stating [...] "The proper {{way to look at}} {{homosexuality}} is to regard it not as something separate but as something <b>to</b> which <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can succumb if the circumstances of our lives or the weakness of our outlook make us susceptible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the simple}} reason that you never get into a fast one, that you do not wear her fairly out, before you give her up. The Plantagenet, Sir Wycherly, is the fastest two-decker in His Majesty's service, and the vice-admiral knows it too well <b>to</b> let <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> get foot in her, while her timbers will hang together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{he should}} be 'come for,'" [...] said the prince. [...] "Oh, no; it was a mere accident, and might have {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who chanced to sit down on my carpet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right!" [...] {{broke in}} Spud. [...] "What {{happened}} might have occurred <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I {{think we ought}} to be thankful that Songbird--that's the name we all call John, you know--wasn't killed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't pretend <b>to</b> say. Do <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> really know, I wonder, what {{we would}} do under any given circumstances? I wish you would tell me exactly what your friend complained of in my {{treatment}} of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{speak to}} Jones about me. It's all right. I guess he won't be interfering with me any more, eh? And come early to-morrow morning. We've {{got a lot}} of rehearsing to do. To-day I will call a holiday for you. And, believe me, Miss Stanton, this is nothing <b>to</b> worry <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> The judge settles it, right or wrong, for the law defies us all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be true, my dear; {{but nobody}} knows. Emily hasn't breathed {{a word about}} it <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> And Mr. Morris keeps his own secret. Now and then we catch him looking at her--and we draw our own conclusions." ...|$|E
60|$|To Davidson, as <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{the idea}} of Heyst, the {{wandering}} drifting, unattached Heyst, having any belongings {{of the sort that}} can furnish a house was startlingly novel. It was grotesquely fantastic. It was like a bird owning real property.|$|E
60|$|We saluted {{properly}}, {{and properly}} went about the business. It {{was nothing new}} <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> The footing was good, as promised. There was no dew. The moon shone fair, and Fortini's blade and mine were out and at earnest play.|$|E
50|$|The current Combat Readiness Medal {{is awarded}} <b>to</b> <b>any</b> member <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve, who have {{accomplished}} sustained individual combat mission readiness in an Air Force weapon system {{or who have}} undertaken the preparedness for direct weapon-system employment.

50|$|This was {{a two-month}} theme show of portraits of normal people {{depicted}} as dictators. Based {{on the theory}} that dictators are average people with access <b>to</b> power, <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could be a dictator. Eleven artists took part, including Kevin Cyr, Catharine Lyons, Thomas Sarvello, Ted Riederer and Pete Petrine. This show was exhibited in the front room of Niagara bar and is featured in the Antagonist movie Mark of the Ninja.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is too late, now, to do {{anything}} to-night," [...] Dirck observed. [...] "Besides, I don't think any great calamity is likely <b>to</b> befall <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> or Doortje would have dropped some hint about it. These fortune-tellers seldom let anything serious pass without a notice of some sort or other. You see, Corny, we went through all this business at Ty, without a scratch, which is so much in favour of the old woman's being right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes.' She added hurriedly, as if {{to change}} the subject, 'I have told nobody that we are sisters, or that you are known {{in any way to}} me or to mother or <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I thought that would be best, from what you said.' ...|$|E

[...] He, too, put on a jumper, {{and in a few}} minutes the boys had the back axle of the touring car jacked up.|$|E
6000|$|They all {{understand}} this, even Mr. Green Walker. [...] "I don't {{know that he}} is any good <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> at all, now," [...] says the talented member for the Crewe Junction. [...] "He's a great deal too uppish to suit my book: and I know a great many people that think so too. There's my uncle--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine!" [...] cried Stanley. [...] "That Miss Ruggles deserves it, too. She thinks, {{just because}} her father has rocks, {{that she is}} too good <b>to</b> even {{recognize}} <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> The only fellow she tolerates is Tubby-- I guess because he's such a dude." ...|$|R
2500|$|Known until 1947 {{simply as}} the [...] "Victory Medal", the World War I Victory Medal was awarded <b>to</b> <b>any</b> member <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> {{military}} who {{had served in the}} armed forces between the following dates in the following locations: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if, after they had recovered from their defeat, half of them made a big circuit over the hills--no doubt they know every foot of them--and, coming down {{at the bottom of the}} ravine, built a strong barricade, making up their minds to guard both ends until we were obliged to surrender from want of food. Having suffered so heavily, they would do everything in their power <b>to</b> prevent <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> from getting out alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{should you}} do this?' she said reproachfully, {{as soon as they}} were alone. 'He's emptied it once, though it held enough for ten people; and now he's not {{contented}} wi' the small, but must needs call for more o' the strong! And a stranger unbeknown <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> For my part, I don't like the look o' the man at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‚ÄúI {{hope that}} {{that has made the}} matter all right,‚Äù the Peruvian {{said in a low voice}} to Stephen; ‚Äúbut we must watch him closely for a short time and see how he goes on. If he looks at the matter sensibly he must see that, as I said, the gold is of no value <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> at present.‚Äù ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was right}} in her instinct. Strange as it was, bizarre as it may {{hereafter}} seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much. And the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> as we had dreaded.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} about the money," [...] said Gertrude, [...] "I am {{quite sure that}} it would all come right." [...] He did mean about the money, and was evidently uneasy in his mind when the {{suggested}} step was made manifest to him. Gertrude was astonished to see how long and melancholy his face could become. [...] "Papa was never unkind about money in his life," [...] said Gertrude. [...] "He could not endure <b>to</b> have <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that," [...] Mr. Atherton said. [...] "The Hau-Haus have always proved themselves even more merciless towards the friendly natives than towards the whites; and these men, being unarmed, might, even with the best disposition in the world, be afraid {{to come to the}} house. At any rate, I am glad those fellows have made off. You see, they were in a position <b>to</b> shoot <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> if they got the chance, while we were scarce in a position to return the compliment." ...|$|R
