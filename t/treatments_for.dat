40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{increasing}} consensus in favour of integrated treatment of substance use disorders and co-morbid conditions, such as depression or anxiety. However, up till now no systematic reviews have been published. Methods Based on a systematic search of MedLine and PsychInfo, 9 trials of integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> depression or anxiety plus substance use disorder were identified. Where possible, meta-analyses were carried out, using random effects models. Results Meta-analyses were carried out <b>for</b> integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> depression and substance use disorders {{on a number of}} outcomes. No meta-analysis could be carried out <b>for</b> integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> anxiety and substance use disorders, due to multivariate reporting of outcomes in original articles. Integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> depression and substance abuse produced significant effects on percent days abstinent at follow-up. Differences in retention and symptoms were non-significant, but favoured the experimental condition. For studies of integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> co-morbid anxiety disorders and substance use disorders, no meta-analysis could be carried out. Several studies of integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> anxiety and substance use disorders reported that patients assigned to substance use treatment only fared better. Conclusion Psychotherapeutic <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> co-morbid depression and substance use disorders is a promising approach, but is not sufficiently empirically supported at this point. Psychotherapeutic <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> co-morbid anxiety and substance use disorders is not empirically supported. There is a need for more trials to replicate the findings from studies of integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> depression and substance use disorders, and for the development of new <b>treatment</b> options <b>for</b> co-morbid anxiety and substance use disorders. </p...|$|R

5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. <b>Treatments</b> <b>for</b> chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
5|$|Many topical <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> dentin {{hypersensitivity}} are available, including desensitizing toothpastes {{and protective}} varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> speech {{disorders}} associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Potential {{antiviral}} therapies include topical microbicide {{treatments that}} use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard Medical School; in mice, so far) by {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression, and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> osteochondritis dissecans is controversial.
