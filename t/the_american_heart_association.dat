Added sugars are hard to recognize due to not being clearly labeled. Some added sugars labeled are brown sugar, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates as well as sugar molecules: dextrose, glucose, lactose, maltose and sucrose. Common foods with added sugar are a carbonated soft drinks (12 oz. can =132.5 calories) non-fat =77.5 calories), fruit punch drink (12 oz. can =62.1 calories), vanilla ice cream (1/2 cup = 48 calories), cake doughnut (1=74.2 calories [...] )and so forth (Sugar101).|$|R
