5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games.

Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>name</b> with use of his title.

5|$|The AT Plaza is {{a public}} space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture. The plaza opened in July 2004 with the {{unveiling}} of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park.

5|$|The {{promoters}} of the HStP {{were inspired by}} the recent success of the City and South London Railway (C), the world's first deep-tube railway. This had opened in November 1890 and had seen large passenger numbers {{in its first year}} of operation. Bills for three similarly inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 legislative session, and, to ensure a consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals. The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction and operation of deep-tube railways, and made recommendations on the diameter of tube tunnels, method of traction, and the granting of wayleaves. After preventing the construction of the branch beyond Euston, the Committee allowed the HStP bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration. The rest of the route was approved and, following a change of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>name,</b> the bill received royal assent on 24 August 1893 as the Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Act, 1893.|$|E
