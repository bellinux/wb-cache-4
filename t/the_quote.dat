5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving <b>the</b> <b>quote,</b> sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge <b>the</b> <b>quote,</b> or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{importance}} of <b>the</b> size <b>quoted</b> by <b>the</b> specialist in the adjustment of prices. <b>The</b> <b>quoted</b> size is <b>the</b> maximum trade size for which <b>the</b> posted <b>quotes</b> are guaranteed. We find {{that the impact of}} trades on subsequent quote revisions depends significantly on whether the trade size exceeds <b>the</b> <b>quoted</b> size. Although larger trades are followed by larger quote revisions, most of <b>the</b> variation in <b>quote</b> revisions is explained by whether the trade size exceeds <b>the</b> <b>quoted</b> size. Once it does, further increases in the trade size have no effect. Our results also indicate that only a fraction of trades move <b>the</b> <b>quotes.</b> We thank Stewart Myers, Robert Pindyck, David Scharfstein, Chester Spatt, and Bob Wood. 1 Economists long have been interested in how prices are set in security markets.

25|$|The disputed {{quotation}} {{was published}} {{by a number of}} media outlets and websites in the Muslim world and elsewhere in conjunction with anti-Israel commentary, including on IslamOnline; the English language Pakistani newspaper, The Nation; and the London-based Arabic newspaper, Al-Hayat, which published <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> in a July 11, 2005, opinion article.

25|$|Although {{the above}} {{quotation}} is often attributed to Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in Serbia, {{it is in}} fact an orthographic principle devised by the German grammarian and philologist Johann Christoph Adelung. Karadžić merely used that principle to push through his language reform. The attribution of <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> to Karadžić is a common misconception in Serbia, Montenegro and the rest of former Yugoslavia. Due to that fact, the entrance exam to the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology occasionally contains a question on the authorship of <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> (as a sort of trick question).|$|E
50|$|In this case, the Copyright Board {{found that}} quotes {{reproduced}} in a History Channel documentary were substantial. <b>The</b> <b>quotes</b> themselves were relatively short and extracted {{from a book}} that was several hundred pages long, thus quantitatively unsubstantial. However, a qualitative analysis of <b>the</b> <b>quotes</b> led <b>the</b> Board to conclude that by using <b>the</b> <b>quotes,</b> <b>the</b> film would appropriate the author’s knowledge, time and talent, elements that reflected an exercise of the author’s skill and judgment. The sections of the book in question were original expressions of the facts and events and involved both creativity and literary merit. While this clearly establishes the work’s originality, there is some uncertainty {{as to whether it}} also establishes whether <b>the</b> <b>quotes</b> “substantial” nature in relation to the rest of this book.|$|R

Complicating the situation, Navarro-Valls told Dreher that the e-mail sent to McEveety was not genuine, suggesting it was fabricated. However, Noonan later verified {{that all of}} the Navarro-Valls e-mails came from the same Vatican IP address. The Los Angeles Times reported that they had previously confirmed the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> from Navarro-Valls when the story first broke.

25|$|This section's {{focus on}} Joseph is unusual. Swiss theologian Eduard Schweizer {{suggests}} that Matthew {{is far more}} concerned with proving Jesus' legal status as the stepson of Joseph, and thus a legal heir of David, than with proving the Virgin Birth. Schweizer feels this evinces Matthew's intended audience was of predominantly Jewish background, a pattern continuing throughout the Gospel, and the importance Old Testament references provides further evidence. Hill feels <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> from Isaiah was, in fact, the central element and believes the entire {{last part of the}} chapter was written to prove that Jesus' story matches the prophecy.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the multimodal production of character viewpoint in spoken American English narratives by performing complementary {{qualitative and quantitative}} analyses of two quoted dialogues, focusing on the storyteller’s use of character viewpoint gestures, character intonation, character facial expression, spatial orientation and gaze. A micro-analysis revealed that the extent of multimodal articulation depends on (i) <b>the</b> <b>quoted</b> speaker, with different multimodal articulatory patterns found for <b>quotes</b> by <b>the</b> speaker’s past self vs. a third-person character, and (ii) the position of <b>the</b> <b>quoted</b> utterance within <b>the</b> <b>quoted</b> dialogue, with mid-dialogue utterances garnering less co-articulation than initial or final utterances within <b>the</b> <b>quoted</b> dialogue. We further investigated these observations using a quantitative approach, {{which was based on}} 'generalized additive modeling' (GAM). The GAM analysis revealed different multimodal patterns for each quoted character, as indicated by the number of co-produced multimodal articulators. These patterns were found to hold regardless of <b>the</b> <b>quote’s</b> position within <b>the</b> narrative. We discuss these findings with respect to previous work on multimodal quotation.

Fifteen of the instalments contained illustrations by J. Abbey (Joseph van Abbé, brother of Salomon van Abbé). This version did not contain any chapter divisions and omitted various small paragraphs such as <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> in Part I, Chapter twelve from Dr Gerard which is taken from Book IV of Ecclesiastes. The political argument between Lady Westholme and Dr Gerard in chapter ten about the League of Nations was also deleted. Finally, the epilogue did {{not appear in the}} serialisation.|$|E
25|$|An acrostic {{is a type}} of word puzzle, in eponymous acrostic form, that {{typically}} consists of two parts. The first is a set of lettered clues, each of which has numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer. The second part is a long series of numbered blanks and spaces, representing a quotation or other text, into which the answers for the clues fit. In most forms of the puzzle, the first letters of each correct clue answer, read in order from clue A on down the list, will spell out the author of <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> and the title of the work it is taken from; this can be used as an additional solving aid.|$|E
25|$|A non-representative {{survey on}} the sexual {{behaviour}} of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had {{a response rate of}} about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females <b>the</b> <b>quote</b> was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.|$|E

Several times during her career she took the risk to leave established shows for new productions where she had more influence, like her move from the well established heute journal to the heute nacht news show. Her daily lifestyle magazine Leute heute became very successful after it was at first less popular than expected and in 1995 the 2000th episode was shown.
