40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{a study conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a <b>teaching</b> <b>programme</b> on “Ergonomics for Computer use ” among the staff of Majan College. A pre experimental research design was used to conduct the study. Thirty samples who met the study criteria were selected using convenience sampling technique. The knowledge level of the staff was assessed using a pretest questionnaire. The subjects were then exposed to a planned <b>teaching</b> <b>programme.</b> The <b>teaching</b> <b>programme</b> included power point presentation with multimedia clippings, demonstration of exercises regarding ergonomics of computer use. The post test questionnaire was administered to the staff, to determine whether there is a gain in knowledge due to the exposure of the subjects to the <b>teaching</b> <b>programme.</b> The results of the experiment showed that there was an increase in the pretest (m= 9. 36, s= 3. 91) and the post test mean (m= 15. 99, s= 3. 09) scores. Paired “t ” test, proved that there was a significant difference in the pre and the post test scores (t 29 = 11. 466) at 5 % level of significance. This difference was due to the intervention in the knowledge of the subjects. The practical application of this intervention would create health awareness to all computer users, thus improving quality of work environment. Index Terms—Computer Ergonomic...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Over {{half of the}} UK {{population}} holds a driver’s licence. Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) {{guidelines are}} available for conditions from most specialties. Despite this, no focused training occurs in the undergraduate or postgraduate setting. We evaluate {{the impact of a}} <b>teaching</b> <b>programme</b> to improve guideline awareness. Methods A 25 -point questionnaire was designed using the current DVLA guidelines. Five questions were included for the following fields: neurology, cardiology, drug and alcohol abuse, visual disorders, and respiratory. This was distributed to doctors in training at five hospitals. Four weeks later a single session <b>teaching</b> <b>programme</b> was implemented. The questionnaire was redistributed. Pre- and post-intervention scores were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results 139 pre-teaching and 144 post-teaching questionnaires were completed. Implementation of a single session <b>teaching</b> <b>programme</b> significantly improved knowledge of DVLA guidelines in all five areas explored. Median scores: neurology- pre-teaching 40 %, post-teaching 100 %, p< 0. 001; cardiology- 0 %, 100 %, p< 0. 001; drug and alcohol misuse- 0 %, 100 %, p< 0. 001; visual disorders- 40 %, 100 %, p< 0. 001; respiratory disorders- 20 %, 100 %, p< 0. 001; and overall- 28 %, 92 %, p< 0. 001. Conclusions Knowledge of DVLA guidelines amongst our cohort was poor. Implementation of a single session <b>teaching</b> <b>programme</b> can significantly improve guideline knowledge and awareness, serving as a cost-effective intervention...|$|R
