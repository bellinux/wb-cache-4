5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell to <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized {{regions of}} DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions {{is to allow}} the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and {{photographs from the}} time of opening consulted, and the bridge was restored to its original appearance. The main body of the bridge was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The deck of {{the bridge}} was formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spans.

5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement.

5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E

5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten {{to a side}} with one in the stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and {{with the development of}} naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight to a side, as the guns near <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side. Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rood screen) to enable a more intimate celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E

5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E
