5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility.

5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due to <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations on <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to}} which a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{many animals}} {{to find their}} way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice. Questions were raised at the time about <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> the train and tunnel electronics to withstand the mix of snow, salt and ice which collect in the tunnels during periods of extreme cold.|$|E
5|$|Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights asserts similar privacy {{limitations}} to the ECPA and limits the processing and sharing of personal data {{both within the}} EU and with external countries. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> UK law enforcement to conduct digital forensics investigations is legislated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.|$|E

5|$|As {{a protein}} {{synthesis}} inhibitor, it affects <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> bacteria to produce protein. This either stops growth or results in bacterial death. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact {{mechanism of action}} of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the start of protein production, rather {{than one of the}} later steps. As of 2014 bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained low.|$|E
5|$|At {{particular}} issue was <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> sensors to differentiate an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts {{argued that a}} more comprehensive compliance system would be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity depend on <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> {{the immune system}} to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

Therefore, gameplay features like the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E
5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although {{the rest of the}} radar used Vacuum tubes. The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, was used to test <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> the system.|$|E
