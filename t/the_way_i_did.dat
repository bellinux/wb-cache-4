500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E

However, another Philadelphia Inquirer review said that the song was [...] "a not terribly good version of Jules Shear's terribly good [...]" [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post believed that it was her most reflective song. Kevin East of Sensible Sound said that the song was [...] "a heavy, melancholy tune." [...] Leslie Gray Streeter of the Palm Beach Post said that the song was [...] "lovely" [...] and [...] "delicate." [...] Even Shear himself was a fan of Lauper's version, saying [...] "The Cyndi Lauper thing where she did 'All Through the Night,' that was great because she did it so differently than <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I liked that, too." [...] However, the St. Petersburg Times did not like the song, saying that it was a [...] "pedestrian filler number" [...] on the album.|$|E

500|$|On 15 October 2014, {{the former}} co-admin of the sister page Responsabilidad for Tamaulipas, María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio (also known by her Twitter account @Miut3 and Felina), was kidnapped, tortured, {{and killed by}} alleged {{organized}} crime members. She had a strong follower-base on Twitter and was known for posting about risk situations, shootouts, and information about criminal groups from Tamaulipas. Her captors allegedly posted several tweets on her profile, prompting shocking reactions on social media. The first tweet revealed her identity and profession as a doctor, and ended by saying that her [...] "life {{had come to an}} end". Two minutes later, another tweet asked others to not make the mistakes she did (of posting about organized crime). The third tweet warned Valor por Tamaulipas and two other Twitter users, @Bandolera7 and @civilarmado_mx, of posting about risk situations. The fourth and final tweet said the following: [...] "Close your accounts, don't risk your families <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I ask you all for forgiveness," [...] and included two photos of her. One of them showed her alive, and the second one showed her corpse splattered in blood. Twitter later deactivated the account but the photos had already leaked across social media.|$|E
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child.

2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm {{going to have my}} name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry I hurt her <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> that was not my intention."
