In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>had</b> made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>had</b> issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor.
