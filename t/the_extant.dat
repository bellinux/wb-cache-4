5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} {{are held}} to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. <b>The</b> <b>extant</b> family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>extant</b> rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{springbok}} {{are known}} from the Pliocene; the antelope appears to have evolved about three million years ago from a gazelle-like ancestor. Three fossil species of Antidorcas have been identified, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>extant</b> form, and {{appear to have been}} widespread across Africa. Two of these, A. bondi and A. australis, became extinct around 7,000 years ago (early Holocene). The third species, A. recki, probably gave rise to <b>the</b> <b>extant</b> form A. marsupialis during the Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. Fossils have been reported from Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sites in northern, southern, and eastern Africa. Fossils dating back to 80 and 100 thousand years ago have been excavated at Herolds Bay Cave (Western Cape Province, South Africa) and Florisbad (Free State), respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> oldest <b>extant</b> Japanese lexica date to {{the early}} Heian period. Based on the Chinese Yupian, the Tenrei Banshō Meigi was {{compiled}} around 830 by Kūkai and is <b>the</b> oldest <b>extant</b> character dictionary made in Japan. The Hifuryaku is a massive Chinese dictionary in 1000 fascicles listing the usage of words and characters in more than 1500 texts of diverse genres. Compiled in 831 by Shigeno Sadanushi and others, it is <b>the</b> oldest <b>extant</b> Japanese proto-encyclopedia. There are two National Treasures of the Ishinpō, <b>the</b> oldest <b>extant</b> medical treatise of Japanese authorship compiled in 984 by Tanba Yasuyori. It {{is based on a}} large number of Chinese medical and pharmaceutical texts and contains knowledge about drug prescription, herbal lore, hygiene, acupuncture, moxibustion, alchemy and magic.

5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus.
