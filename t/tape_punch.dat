50|$|Four {{different}} <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> {{units are}} available for use with the Model 28 ASR. These are the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR). Similarly, there are four different tape reader options. These are the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD) and pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD). There is also an option that installs a second <b>tape</b> <b>punch,</b> usually a typing reperforator (LPR) under the dome just behind the tape reader. The second <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> is driven by its own motor.|$|E

50|$|The only input was a {{paper tape}} reader {{and the only}} outputs were the console printer and paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch.</b> As the paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> was much faster than the printer, most output was punched, and then listed on an {{off-line}} printer.

50|$|A {{paper tape}} reader, the IBM 2671, was {{introduced}} in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a paper tape reader and paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> from an earlier era, available only as RPQs (Request Price Quotation). The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 Teleprocessing System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.|$|E
50|$|The Z1 {{contained}} {{almost all}} the parts of a modern computer, i.e. control unit, memory, micro sequences, floating-point logic and input-output devices. The Z1 was freely programmable via <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and a <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> reader. There was a clear separation between the <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> reader, the control unit for supervising the whole machine and {{the execution of the}} instructions, the arithmetic unit, and the input and output devices.The input tape unit read perforations in 35-millimeter film.|$|R
5000|$|Paper media, such as {{punched cards}} and <b>punched</b> <b>tape,</b> may also {{experience}} literal rotting. Mylar <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> {{is available for}} use in such situations.|$|R
50|$|The code of {{the system}} was written in {{assembly}} language for the Dutch Electrologica X8 computer. This computer had a word size of 27 bits, 32 kilowords of core memory, 512 kilowords of drum memory providing backing store for the LRU cache algorithm, paper tape readers, paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches,</b> plotters, and printers.|$|R
50|$|While {{there was}} an {{optional}} high-speed paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> (the PTP-1 at 60 digits per second) for output, the standard punch operated at 17 hex characters per second (510 bytes per minute).|$|E
50|$|Single Character - The single {{character}} output provides four-bit characters {{suitable for}} typewriter, <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> or other similar output equipment. A parity check bit and two timing bits are issued automatically with each character.|$|E
5000|$|Paper-tape {{capability}} {{was offered}} with 5, 6, 7, or 8 channel tape punches and readers. The punched tape reader operated at 200 {{characters per second}} and the <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> ran at 100 characters per second.|$|E
50|$|Razor-wire has {{a central}} strand of high tensile {{strength}} wire, and a steel <b>tape</b> <b>punched</b> into a shape with barbs. The steel tape is then cold-crimped tightly to the wire everywhere except for the barbs. Barbed tape is very similar, but has no central reinforcement wire. The process of combining the two is called roll forming.|$|R
50|$|Some early computers, {{such as the}} 1944 IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) {{received}} {{program instructions}} from a paper <b>tape</b> <b>punched</b> with holes, similar to Jacquard's string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid 1980s.|$|R
50|$|For {{input and}} output, the PDP-8 {{had a single}} {{interrupt}} shared by all devices, an I/O bus accessed by I/O instructions and a direct memory access (DMA) channel. The programmed I/O bus typically ran low to medium-speed peripherals, such as printers, teletypes, paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> and readers, while DMA was used for cathode ray tube screens with a light pen, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, tape drives and disk drives.|$|R
