5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. <b>The</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513â€“AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E

5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising.

Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E

5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have found no evidence that anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E
