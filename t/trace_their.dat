5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans <b>trace</b> <b>their</b> ancestry to the Ghassanids, {{including}} al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran.

5|$|Charismatics <b>trace</b> <b>their</b> {{historical}} origins to {{the charismatic}} {{movement of the}} 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road <b>trace</b> <b>their</b> origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom.

They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries.

In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller.
