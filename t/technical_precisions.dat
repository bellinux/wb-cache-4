40|$|This {{investigation}} {{offers another}} perspective to us of {{study on the}} analysis of the Ceramics of Angualasto type. This study raises an analysis from the experimental {{point of view of the}} composition of pastes, construction, technique, formal analysis and Interpretation on the function that the “TAPAS de Urnas” (covers of ballot box) have (asymmetric escudillas) vasijas pertaining to funeral fardos and “Vasijas GRANDES con asas” (Big Vessels with handles) founded on the border of the rivers, according to its form and applied technology Gambier (2000) published, in its work “Prehistoria de San Juan” (perhistory of San Juan). The general aspects related to the Angualasto culture, that lived in the province of San Juan since 1200 A. C. to 1490 A. C. belonging to the delayed period of the farming stage of the region. This work continues the investigation initiated by Varela (2004), from which I make a macrocospic analysis on the <b>technical</b> <b>precisions,</b> formal and icongraphics of the Angualasto ceramics; which determined characteristics that differentiate it, from the type of manufacture to the form, icongraphics and decoration of the Angualasto ceramics of those of the Sanagasta culture, regional Inca and Chilean North...|$|E

50|$|Wilhelm Kunst was {{a natural}} artist with his {{individual}} style of <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> and particular expressiveness of his works. The material he worked with was oak and lime wood from the nature in his neighbourhood, processed by far more than 100 various knives.|$|R
5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Kurt Ballou {{was working as}} a {{biomedical}} engineer when his then project got cancelled. Instead of selecting a different position within the same company that he had worked with for six years, Ballou opted to receive a severance package which he used to build his own recording studio. His experiences and knowledge in engineering carry over to his recording work. In regards to Ballou's <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> as a producer Bannon has stated, [...] "nothing gets by him—it is inspiring to watch him work." ...|$|R

50|$|During this period, the {{aristocracy}} developed {{a taste for}} fine art, leaving behind the lack of <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> in art which had defined colonial times.The national artists still did not gain their own clear identity during this period, however, as painting remained dedicated predominantly to portraits, nature and representing the most important historical events. Historians Galaz and Ivelic wrote that while Europe discovered America during the 15th century, America {{did not look at}} Europe until the beginning of the 19th century, explaining the Americans’ fascination with European art in this period.|$|R
5000|$|Filmmaker Carlos Diegues {{claims that}} while {{lack of funds}} lowered the <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> of Cinema Novo films, it also allowed directors, writers and {{producers}} to have an unusual amount of creative freedom. [...] "Because Cinema Novo is not a school, it has no established style," [...] states Diegues. [...] "In Cinema Novo, expressive forms are necessarily personal and original without formal dogmas". This directorial freedom, along with the changing social and political climate in Brazil, caused Cinema Novo to experience shifts in form and content in {{a short amount of}} time.|$|R
50|$|Some {{languages}} {{have been}} created {{with the intention of}} avoiding ambiguity, especially lexical ambiguity. Lojban and Loglan are two related languages which {{have been created}} for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.|$|R
2500|$|De Sabata's {{conducting}} style {{combined the}} fiery temperament, iron control and <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> of Toscanini with greater spontaneity {{and attention to}} orchestral color. He was exceptionally demanding of his players: according to one musician: [...] "Those eyes and ears missed nothing ... the players {{had been made to}} work harder than ever before and they knew that, without having been asked to play alone, they had been individually assessed". On the podium he [...] "seemed to be dancing everything from a tarantella to a sabre dance". He suffered from a limp {{as a result of a}} childhood polio infection.|$|R
50|$|Back on home soil, Otto {{tackled the}} local drift series with <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> and skill, bagging him two {{consecutive}} local drift series titles, {{two years in}} a row. In 2009, he set out to build the first ever drift circuit in South Africa, which can be used for Tar Oval Racing as well. Monstermob Raceway was previously known as the Kimberley showgrounds, today hosts various local events which include go-kart endurance races, Off road, Quad bike, Spinning, Drifting, Oval, as well as local community backed events aimed at raising funds for local charities and non-profit organizations.|$|R
50|$|Silva {{is a well}} rounded fighter whose {{striking}} {{ability is}} considered {{to be one of the}} best in MMA. Silva's striking accuracy, knockout power, technically vicious Muay Thai and ability to counterstrike makes him a danger to his opponents. Silva's striking uses three major strengths: <b>technical</b> <b>precision,</b> the jab, and transitions and movement. Silva switches from southpaw to orthodox with little drop-off in effectiveness. Although it has been claimed that his ground game is not as good as his stand-up, Silva has submitted notable grapplers, including Olympic wrestler Dan Henderson, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blackbelt Travis Lutter and Olympic alternate Chael Sonnen.|$|R

I am getting to the point where I don't much care." [...] He felt [...] "surprised that the plot hangs together more than in the other two films." ...|$|R
50|$|Florence's next {{accomplishment}} {{was a major}} work of ornithology and {{a complement}} to Frank Chapman's Handbook of Birds of the Eastern United States. Drawing on the best available published work, study of specimens {{with the assistance of}} Robert Ridgway of the Smithsonian Institution, 600 illustrations from numerous sources, and her own field work, she published Handbook of Birds of the Western United States in 1902. The book would remain a standard reference in regional ornithology for at least 50 years. Without sacrificing <b>technical</b> <b>precision,</b> the handbook included vivid descriptions of behaviors like nesting, feeding, and vocalization, information that has been de-emphasized in the literature that followed.|$|R

50|$|The {{landscapes of}} Boudewijns can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three types. The first type resembles {{the work of the}} Sonian Forest school of landscape painters such as Jacques d'Arthois and Cornelis Huysmans. These painters from Brussels had a preference for depicting sand flats with deep lying roads surrounded by trees. These compositions show the landscapes in a bright light. A second type of landscape depicts Italianate architectural elements set in a flat landscape with a row of hills as a backdrop. Finally, he made a number of village and river landscapes that recall the style of Jan Brueghel the Elder in compositional structure and <b>technical</b> <b>precision.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An extract of the {{citation}} {{signed by the}} Director Professor Alexander von Fielitz and her teachers reads [...] "Her predetermination, the clarity and purity of her comprehension, the simplicity and natural manner of her performance, give her rendition a rare objectivity, calmness and technical competence. Her sincerity and purpose combined with a rare clarity and <b>technical</b> <b>precision,</b> {{as well as a}} fine musical dexterity, a loving and subtle extraction of every small detail give this new and unusual recital technique a compelling charm. These abilities further enhance the continued development of Miss Fischer’s compulsive, energetic and well disciplined character and clever mind on its way to a great artistic talent”.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} program EvolFMC v. 2 that solves the {{evolution}} equations in QCD for the parton momentum distributions {{by means of}} the Monte Carlo technique based on the Markovian process. The program solves the DGLAP-type evolution as well as modified-DGLAP ones. In both cases the evolution can be performed in the LO or NLO approximation. The quarks are treated as massless. The overall <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> of the code has been established at 0. 05 % precision level.

5000|$|The Cooper Union Art {{program is}} often {{referred}} to as [...] "generalist" [...] or [...] "versatile" [...] when compared to other Fine Arts colleges; incoming students do not choose an academic major within the Fine Arts field, but instead are permitted and encouraged to select courses from any of the School of Art's departments. This approach allows for a personalized curriculum which addresses each student's particular interests, regardless of variation or eclecticism. In addition, the program and curriculum place heavy emphasis on each student's creative and imaginative abilities, rather than <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> in a specific medium, to develop the social awareness and critical analysis skills relevant to art in the contemporary world.|$|R
2500|$|In a mixed review, Kevin Ritchie of Now {{felt that}} The MF Life is [...] "closer to a {{traditional}} multi-producer record featuring a checklist of styles ... that showcase her <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> as a singer but reluctance to colour outside the lines."

50|$|Revolving {{around the}} {{cultural}} patronage of the Olappamanna Mana and the locally famous temples like Sri *Kanthalloor kshethram and Chenginikottu Kavu, Vellinezhi {{has grown in}} stature as the homestead of a few classical Kerala art forms. Primary {{among them is the}} dance-drama, Kathakali, the <b>technical</b> <b>precision</b> and aethetic quality of which rose to great heights during {{the life and times of}} Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon who polished and made the Kalluvazhi style of the art artfully elaborate. It is his set of disciples, along with the playback musicians, percussionists, make-up (chutti), costumes (petti) artistes that he groomed who later made Vellinezhi proud. The village, critically, has a house named Kothavil that has specialised in the craft of designing and making Kathakali costumes.|$|R
