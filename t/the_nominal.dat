Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed <b>the</b> <b>nominal</b> working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol.

40|$|Abstract—The {{literature}} to date {{indicates that it}} is necessary to introduce the concept of selection into the description and analysis of <b>the</b> English <b>nominal</b> group. This paper will carry out a delicate exploration of the functional structure of <b>the</b> English <b>nominal</b> group with <b>the</b> quantifying selection. It aims to identify the function of the item of in <b>the</b> English <b>nominal</b> and thus to explore the whole functional structure of <b>the</b> English <b>nominal</b> group with <b>the</b> quantifying selection. Through the analysis, we found that besides the function as a preposition, and selector, the item of can also function as a finisher in <b>the</b> English <b>nominal</b> group.

Collectively the tag-sets provide information about <b>the</b> <b>nominals</b> expressed, <b>the</b> discourse relations between <b>the</b> <b>nominals</b> (e. g. coreference, set, class), the domain actions under discussion, and agreement states during collaborative negotiations as derived from influences on the speaker and hearer and the problem solving state as characterized by parameter settings...|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} time all four Canadian {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions. This brought <b>the</b> <b>nominal</b> strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOur {{study is}} based on a corpus of "philosophical discussions" held in a school context and {{involving}} French speakers. The analysis of grammatical subject forms shows, firstly, that in pupils' speech acts <b>the</b> canonical <b>nominal</b> form (e. g. les animaux) is much rarer than the "reinforced" form (e. g. les animaux ils). Secondly, that <b>the</b> simple <b>nominal</b> form appears mostly in quoted utterances whereas <b>the</b> reinforced <b>nominal</b> form (as well as the pronominal one) is used in original speech acts. We relate this observation to our hypothesis that <b>the</b> reinforced <b>nominal</b> form marks <b>the</b> focalized status of a clause, compared to <b>the</b> simple <b>nominal</b> form which marks a non-focalized status. In the repetitions/reformulations offered by the teachers, both forms appear; the choice of one or the other is shown {{to be related to the}} functional-communicative type of the quoted utterance: "relaunch" (focalized) or "acknowledgement" (non-focalized) ...|$|R

5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders.
