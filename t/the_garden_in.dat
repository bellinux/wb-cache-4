5|$|Sir David further {{extended}} the castle {{in the late}} 16th century, {{with the addition of}} a large north range with round corner towers. He laid out <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>in</b> 1604, with symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland, to celebrate the Union of the Crowns of the previous year, when James VI acceded to the English throne on the death of his cousin, Elizabeth I. Sir David died in 1610, heavily in debt as a result of fines handed down for the unruly conduct of his son, and with both the garden and the north range incomplete.|$|E
5|$|The statues were {{eventually}} taken down when Charles II {{came to the}} throne and were either repaired or replaced. A bronze statue of James II by Grinling Gibbons, depicting the king wearing the robes of a Roman emperor, stood just outside <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>in</b> the Pebble Court from 1686 to 1898 (with a short interruption during the Glorious Revolution). It now occupies a spot in Trafalgar Square outside the National Gallery.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>in</b> the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E

25|$|Although the Holst {{house was}} built on a smaller budget this is not {{apparent}} {{in the setting of}} the houses with each house carefully designed in relation to its garden. The importance of <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>in</b> relation to the house architecture may have come from the influence of his former tutor at the Architectural Association, the landscape architect, Geoffrey Jellicoe.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{the kitchen}} fridge, the garden {{contained}} a swimming pool, a seating area and, due to the smoking ban that came into effect in all public places during the series, a smoking area which housemates had to use from Day 1, even though the smoking ban didn't come into play until 1 July. This was checked by health officials, and deemed acceptable. The grass from the previous series has been replaced with AstroTurf.

25|$|The 1950s {{began with}} Charles Adams' son Weston (who had been team {{president}} since 1936) facing financial trouble. He {{was forced to}} accept a buyout offer from Walter A.

Although there were some instances of success (such as making the Stanley Cup Final in 1953, 1957 and 1958, only to lose to the Montreal Canadiens each time), the Bruins mustered only four winning seasons between 1947 and 1967. They missed the playoffs eight straight years between 1960 and 1967.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the main}} hall, the Zen rock garden was {{designed}} by Musō Soseki and consists of a pond with an arched bridge, a waterfall, a small island and a cave. It used {{to be surrounded by}} plants, but they were removed in 1969 to create the present landscape, which is faithful to the original blueprints. The stairs visible in its background go to the Ichirantei. The garden is a nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty. The extreme simplicity of the Zen garden contrasts with <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>in</b> front of the main hall, which is considered the most beautiful in Kamakura.|$|E
