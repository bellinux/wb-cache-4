5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|Bandar endured {{controversy}} over allegations {{in the book}} Plan of Attack by Bob Woodward that President George W. Bush informed him of the decision <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> ahead of Secretary of State Colin Powell.|$|E
25|$|While Powell was wary of a {{military}} solution, he supported the decision <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> after the Bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed. After his departure from the State Department, Powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for American involvement in the Iraq War.|$|E
2500|$|Rumsfeld's plan {{resulted}} in a lightning invasion that took Baghdad in well under a month with very few American casualties. Many government buildings, plus major museums, electrical generation infrastructure, and even oil equipment were looted and vandalized during {{the transition from the}} fall of Saddam Hussein's regime to the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority. A violent insurrection began shortly after the military operation started. After the German and French governments voiced opposition <b>to</b> <b>invading</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Rumsfeld labeled these countries as part of [...] "Old Europe", implying that countries that supported the war were part of a newer, modern Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Of course, {{those of}} us who read Pollack's celebrated 2002 book, [...] "The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq," [...] and became {{convinced}} as a result that the United States needed <b>to,</b> well, <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> in order <b>to</b> dismantle Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear weapons program (the one he didn't actually have) might feel a little too bitter to once again defer to our betters.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{a report}} by veteran investigative {{journalist}} Bob Woodward in his book Plan of Attack, Tenet privately lent his personal authority to the intelligence reports {{about weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs) in Iraq. At a meeting on December 12, 2002, he assured Bush that the evidence that Iraq had WMDs amounted to a [...] "slam dunk case." [...] After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet stated that it was taken out of context. He indicated that it was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people <b>to</b> support <b>invading</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US, British and international forces yielded no significant WMDs.|$|R
25|$|Villepin's {{most famous}} {{assignment}} as Chirac's foreign minister was opposing the U.S. plan <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq,</b> giving France {{a leading role}} in the grouping of countries such as Germany, Belgium, Russia and China that opposed the invasion. The speech he gave to the UN to block a second resolution allowing the use of force against Saddam Hussein's regime received loud applause.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000 the {{situation}} has changed completely. The most significant factor was the United States administration's decision <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003, {{which led to the}} fall of Saddam, a Ba'athist leader with pan-Arab sympathies who was determined to balance Shi'a Iran's regional influence. With the deposition of Saddam, Iran found a major obstacle to its expansion removed. This gave Iran a good chance to emerge as {{a major player in the}} Middle East.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{beginning}} of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, Vicente Fox became the first non-PRI candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the 9/11 attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in Afghanistan, which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq,</b> however.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to these}} allegations, {{this would have}} given the Bush {{administration}} the justification for more widespread abuses of civil liberties and <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> Afghanistan and <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> ensure future supplies of oil. In some cases, even in the mainstream media, [...] "hawks" [...] in the White House—especially former Vice President Dick Cheney, and members of the Project for the New American Century, a neoconservative think tank—have been accused of involvement in, or awareness of, the alleged plot.|$|R
50|$|The game put {{the player}} {{in the role of}} the President of the United States in a {{situation}} loosely based on the Cold War and the early 1990s. Using a timeline that starts during the end of the Ogaden War, players can prepare Kuwait <b>to</b> be <b>invaded</b> by <b>Iraq</b> during Operation Desert Shield. After dealing with the Iraqi adversaries, the player can opt to dethrone the military overlords and political cartels that are keeping the people of South America and Africa in relative poverty.|$|R
5000|$|On May 23, 2007, {{a heated}} {{discussion}} ensued {{because of what}} O'Donnell perceived {{as a lack of}} willingness of Hasselbeck to defend O'Donnell's right <b>to</b> disagree with <b>invading</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the resulting military occupation. O'Donnell also stated that the media would portray her as a bully attacking [...] "innocent pure Christian Elisabeth" [...] whenever they disagreed and she believed Republican pundits were mischaracterizing her statements. Hasselbeck then told O'Donnell to [...] "defend her own insinuations". The debate became more heated when Behar and Shepherd made joking attempts to end the discussion because actress Alicia Silverstone was waiting in the wings to appear as a guest after the commercial break. The incident was widely covered in mainstream media including a split-screen shot of O'Donnell and Hasselbeck arguing.|$|R
25|$|The Fatimids {{attempted}} {{to stabilize the}} situation in Upper Mesopotamia and assist the anti-Seljuq general Arslan al-Basasiri, whom they sought to use <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The Fatimid envoy, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, took a highly negative view of Mani' and leaned towards supporting Thimal, but he was later convinced by the chieftain of the Banu Mazyad in al-Basasiri's camp that Mani' was essential to the anti-Seljuq cause. Thus, al-Mu'ayyad conferred with Mani' and persuaded him to defect to the Fatimids. In reward, al-Basasiri captured Raqqa from Thimal and transferred it to Mani' in October 1057. According to chronicler Ibn Shaddad, al-Basasiri did not capture Raqqa; rather, Thimal handed over both Raqqa and al-Rafiqah to Mani' due to military pressure.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Bush {{becomes a}} born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his {{relationship}} with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential {{to make a name for}} himself. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> to depose Saddam Hussein. After his father loses the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton, Bush blames the loss on his decision not to depose Saddam.|$|E
25|$|Sun Media, and Sun News in particular, was {{involved}} in two separate news stories during the final week of the 2011 federal election that centred {{on two of the}} federal party leaders. The first centred on a photo that appeared to show Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff posing with U.S. military forces in Kuwait in late 2002, months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The source of the photo was Conservative Party operative Patrick Muttart, who had been providing pro bono advice to Sun News regarding its on-air presentation and offered the photo to Sun Media, which ran a story alleging Ignatieff's involvement with the U.S. plans <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Sun Media did not run the photo, however, as the image was illegible and did not conclusively prove of Ignatieff's presence with the U.S. troops. Sun Media head Pierre Karl Péladeau, in an editorial for the Sun papers, claimed the photo was an attempt to not only damage the Ignatieff campaign but the integrity of Sun Media and Sun News as well. The incident led to Muttart's removal from the campaign of Conservative leader and incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper.|$|E
2500|$|The third WSF {{was again}} held in Porto Alegre, in January 2003. There were many {{parallel}} workshops, including, {{for example the}} Life After Capitalism workshop, which proposed focused discussion on non-communist, non-capitalist, participative possibilities for different aspects of social, political, economic, communication structures. [...] Among the speakers was American linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky. Some credit this meeting of World Social Forum for the connections that made the global day of action on February 15, 2003 so successful. The global day of action was an international protest attended by an estimated 12 million people in 700 cities across 60 countries protesting the Bush Administration's plans <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> and occupy <b>Iraq.</b> At the time, the New York Times called international public opinion, a superpower to counter the United States.|$|R
2500|$|Clinton {{strongly}} supported the 2001 U.S. {{military action in}} Afghanistan, saying {{it was a chance}} to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government. Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized United States President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, should such action be required to enforce a United Nations Security Council Resolution after pursuing with diplomatic efforts. (However, Clinton voted against the Levin Amendment to the Resolution, which would have required the President to conduct vigorous diplomacy at the U.N., and would have also required a separate Congressional authorization <b>to</b> unilaterally <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq.</b> [...] She did vote for the Byrd Amendment to the Resolution, which would have limited the Congressional authorization to one year increments, but the only mechanism necessary for the President to renew his mandate without any Congressional oversight was to claim that the Iraq War was vital to national security each year the authorization required renewal.) [...] Clinton later said that she did not read the full classified National Intelligence Estimate that was delivered ten days before the vote to all members of Congress, and that gave a more subtle case for Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction than the Bush Administration's abridged summary, but that she was briefed on the report.|$|R
5000|$|This {{interpretation}} {{has been}} challenged by journalist Solomon Hughes, writing: [...] "You might remember that we <b>invaded</b> <b>Iraq</b> because Saddam did have WMD, but was pretending he didn't. Now it turns out we <b>invaded</b> <b>Iraq</b> because Saddam did not have WMD, but pretended he did." ...|$|R

The details of the interview were not released until after Ford's death, as he requested.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Thatcher criticised {{the way the}} {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> had been made two years previously. Although she still supported the intervention to topple Saddam Hussein, she said that (as a scientist) she would always look for [...] "facts, evidence and proof", before committing the armed forces. She celebrated her 80th birthday on 13 October at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park, London; guests included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair. Lord (Geoffrey) Howe of Aberavon was also in attendance and said of Thatcher: [...] "Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible." ...|$|E

[...] He criticized the American military involvement in the Kosovo War (1998–99) as an imperial action; and described the Iraq Liberation Act (1998), promulgated during the Clinton Administration, as the political license that predisposed the U.S. <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003, which was authorised with the Iraq Resolution (2 October 2002); and the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|American {{television}} comedian Stephen Colbert {{coined the}} term truthiness in this meaning as {{the subject of a}} segment called [...] "The Wørd" [...] during the pilot episode of his political satire program The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of appeal to emotion and [...] "gut feeling" [...] as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse. He particularly applied it to U.S. President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and the decision <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003. Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including Wikipedia. Colbert has sometimes used a Dog Latin version of the term, [...] "Veritasiness".

The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by American, British, and other international forces yielded no stockpiles of nuclear WMDs in Iraq, except for tens of thousands of chemical shells found stacked from floors to ceilings in every room of what was putatively a school building in the Anbar province. And of course the 83 flat bed trucks which sped from Iraq into Syria 3 days before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which were later used by Syrian dictator and former passenger jet pilot Bashar al-Assad against the population whose desire for self-government and liberty were revived after Iraq and Lebanon, whose elected government had not met since shortly after the terrorist group PLO invaded in 1975 and destroyed Beirut, until then called [...] "the Paris of the Middle East", gained representative governments.
