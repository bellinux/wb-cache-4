5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> {{walls of}} Mdina were {{gradually}} dismantled between the 1530s and 1720s, when the city's fortifications were being upgraded by the Hospitallers. One {{of the most}} significant visible remnants of <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> fortifications is the Greeks Gate and the surrounding curtain walls, which still retains its medieval form apart from the outer portal which was built in the 18th century. Parts of the double walls, including the remains of two gun loops, still stand between the gate and the Torre dello Standardo. Most of the northern and eastern walls date back to <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> period, although some sections were rebuilt by the Hospitallers. The northern ramparts contain a medieval wall tower, while the remains of Byzantine antemurals and the foundations of a late 15th-century artillery platform have been found in the eastern walls.|$|E
