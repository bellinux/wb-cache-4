5|$|Roswell {{also did}} theater. In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988 she {{had a role in}} Julia Sweeney's play Mea's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people {{do everything they can to}} dismiss her because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, be frank about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how to}} make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E

5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), but <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so {{they do not have}} to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E

They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be citizens. Well then! If <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them.

25|$|Although {{players who}} have {{achieved}} professional dan ranks are nominally stronger than amateur dan players, in practice some of the strongest 7th dan amateur players have a playing level on par with that of some professional players.

25|$|City councilors can run {{as either}} a {{representative}} of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives {{the greatest number of}} votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.|$|E

25|$|Forced {{prostitution}} and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to abandon their child.|$|E
25|$|After {{the race}} started, Alonso {{was the first}} driver to make a routine pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race {{at the back of}} the field. He had put in a light fuel load in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low {{positions}} tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with {{an opening for}} the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be put {{in a position where they}} would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E
