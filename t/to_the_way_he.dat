5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended at Final Resolution by then-champion Samoa Joe {{against the}} {{challenger}} Christopher Daniels. This rivalry started at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on August14 when Joe won the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament to become number-one contender to the TNA X Division Championship held by Daniels. Joe {{went on to}} compete against A.J. Styles and Daniels in a Three Way match at TNA's Unbreakable PPV event on September11, which Styles won to become the new champion. At Genesis, Joe and Daniels competed in a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match, which Joe and Daniels' team won. After the bout, Joe attacked and injured Daniels, thus sidelining him in the storyline. Joe {{then went on to}} defeat Styles at Turning Point to become the new TNA X Division Champion. After their match, Joe attacked Styles and attempted to injure Styles in a manner similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> injured Daniels. At this time Daniels returned from injury to save Styles from the attack. TNA promoted this match for Final Resolution on the January7, 2006 episode of Impact!.|$|E

These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks´ pages in pristine black and white line art, as close as possible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would originally drawn them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, {{and more than a few}} surprises.

500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film critic}} Baradwaj Rangan, {{in his review}} of another Kamal film, Vishwaroopam (2013), found the {{ethnicity}} {{of the characters in}} the film to be a continuation of Kamal's inclusion of non-Tamil characters in his films. Rangan considered this to be Kamal's acknowledgement of the [...] "interconnectedness of the nation" [...] and [...] "the world beyond India". He pointed out in his article that Kamal had experimented with the concept before by including the usage of Bengali language and meeting Bengalis in Mahanadi (1994), a Telugu-speaking love interest in Nammavar (1994), marrying a Bengali woman in Hey Ram (2000), conducting investigations with an American associate in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006), and marriage to a Frenchwoman in Manmadan Ambu (2010). Rangan notes that in Anbe Sivam, the inclusion of and interaction with the Odia people was another example of including non-Tamil characters in his films. Rangan also compared Kamal's fight sequence with the use of an umbrella <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> used a book and stool in Thoongadhey Thambi Thoongadhey (1983).|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{marriage}} to David {{is central to}} her character. Finch explained that it took Ruth a while {{to see that there}} were good qualities in David, as his initial behaviour towards her was unpleasant. Finch called David [...] "a sexist pig" [...] and said he resented Ruth's presence almost immediately. However, Ruth had noticed his ruggedness and she was attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> helped the sickly animals. After David noticed his brother flirting with Ruth, he realised that he loved her and told her about his feelings. Despite getting off to a bad start, Ruth and David began dating and were married towards the end of 1988. Finch thought Ruth and David had [...] "a really believable partnership" [...] and were well-suited, saying [...] "They are both very capable of becoming highly emotional if something riles them but thankfully they tend to react to different things. So, often one will be able to calm, soothe and support the other through most crises. Or at least provide some kind of balance to a problem." [...] The actress added that Ruth and David are the best of friends.|$|E

"Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash, both of whom worked with Bieber on [...] "One Time", R singer and The-Dream's then wife Christina Milian and labelmate, Ludacris. When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. I met him a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!' I thought you'd always be mine." [...] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "I think the vocals here will convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops." ...|$|E

[...] While ranking {{the character}} fifth, The Stanford Daily wrote, [...] "From his habit of sadistically toying with his prey to his dumb hyena coven <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> leads {{the kingdom of}} Pride Rock into a period of starvation and sorrow, he's a backstabbing dictator of an uncle." [...] Richard Crouse of Metro cited Scar's [...] "Long live the King" [...] as the character's [...] "Most evil line." [...] Additionally, [...] "Be Prepared" [...] is often revered {{as one of the}} greatest Disney villain songs. Official Disney Blogs wrote that the song, with its [...] "hyena backup singers, and the best bone-rattling percussion of all the villains' songs," [...] Scar proves himself [...] "an expert crooner of villainous plots." [...] Aside from Disney and animation, Scar is often revered {{as one of the greatest}} movie villains of all-time. Digital Spy featured the character who, according to author Simon Reynolds, [...] "underlined the sheer blackness of his heart by ruthlessly killing Simba's father," [...] among the [...] "25 greatest movie villains". Similarly, in 2012, Entertainment Weekly ranked the character the twenty-fifth [...] "Most Vile Movie Villain" [...] ever, while Total Film ranked Scar sixty-seventh in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Although Haig {{paid tribute}} to Allenby for the plan's [...] "great initial success", Allenby's {{subordinates}} [...] "objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> handled the... attritional stage". Allenby was sent to command the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. He regarded the transfer as a [...] "badge of failure" [...] but he [...] "more than redeemed his reputation by defeating" [...] the Ottomans in 1917–18. Haig stayed in his post {{until the end of}} the war. When it became apparent that a factor in the British success were the failures of the 6th Army command [...] Ludendorff removed Falkenhausen (who never held a field command again, spending the rest of war as Governor-General of Belgium) and several staff officers. In early 1918, The Times carried an article, Falkenhausen's Reign of Terror, describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians since he had been appointed governor. Ludendorff and Loßberg discovered that although the Allies were capable of breaking through the first position they could probably not capitalise on their success if they were confronted by a mobile, clever defence. Ludendorff immediately ordered more training in manoeuvre warfare for his Eingreif divisions. Loßberg was soon promoted to general and directed the defensive battle of the 4th Army against the Flanders Offensive of the summer and late autumn. (Loßberg had become [...] "legendary as the fireman of the Western Front; always sent by OHL to the area of crisis").|$|E

Oliver is flawed by a lack of confidence and his deceptive nature. He has a tendency to land his work colleagues in trouble, which has been conveyed through storylines with Daisha and Greg. What's on TV highlighted Oliver's [...] "lack of competence" [...] and called him petulant for betraying Penny after his promotion to F2 level. When his career began to deteriorate, the publication deemed him reckless, then found him hapless in the aftermath of her death, in reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> [...] " [...] into despair, finding comfort in drink, drugs and his dead sister's flatmate." [...] The Sunday Mirror Kevin O'Sullivan reflected on Oliver's development since his arrival, with the observation, [...] "Once he was the strutting ladies' man of the wards, a veritable medical Casanova who exuded confidence and charm. But time has taken its toll on Oliver Valentine – and now he is just a shadow of his former self" [...] – a devastated and broken man, [...] "tormented by the memory of his sibling and his guilty conscience." ...|$|E

500|$|Bumgarner pitched for the Augusta Greenjackets, the Giants' Low-A South Atlantic League affiliate, in 2008. The Giants {{sought for}} him to alter the angle of his head during his delivery, but after Bumgarner {{struggled}} over his first three starts in Augusta, he reverted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had thrown in high school. With Augusta, {{he worked on the}} changeup, the slider, and [...] "the ability to pitch inside." [...] When asked if it was tough to work on off-speed pitches in a league in which most of the hitters can be fooled with the fastball, Bumgarner replied, [...] "The minors are all about player development. I needed to work on other pitches and have the confidence to throw them." [...] He won the South Atlantic League pitchers' Triple Crown, tying for the league lead in wins (15, tied with Levi Maxwell), leading the league in earned run average (1.46), and leading the league in strikeouts (164). He began the 2009 season with the Giants' High-A affiliate, the San Jose Giants of the California League. After five starts, in which he went 3–1 with a 1.48 ERA and 23 strikeouts, he was called up to the Giants AA affiliate, the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League. On July 22, he hit a grand slam against Eric Niesen and picked up the victory in a 9–3 triumph over the Binghamton Mets. In 20 games (19 starts) with them, he went 9–1 with a 1.93 ERA and 69 strikeouts.|$|E

Deciding to confront Limbaugh for brainwashing Brian, Lois demands for their dog to go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on [...] "The Company Way", [...] "Republican Town". Angered, Brian decides to move out and become roommates with a reluctant Limbaugh. Brian begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Deciding to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, Brian attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, causing Limbaugh to become frustrated and throw him out. Deciding to prove his devotion to the conservative cause, Brian attempts to waterboard Pelosi before being apprehended and arrested. After being bailed out by Limbaugh later that day, Brian continues to assert his conservatism. Limbaugh attempts to convince Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He tells Brian that a child was executed in Texas and Brian is visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Rush leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to [...] "be around" [...] wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance, and the episode ends with Limbaugh then transforming into a bald eagle and flying away into the skyline.|$|E
