5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> If one team member answers <b>the</b> <b>question</b> correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the solving performance of students in <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of Student Selection Exam (ÖSS) and the Approved Lecture Books of Ministry for the National Education (MEB). The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. Sample of the research is 20 students from 2 different classrooms in 11 th grade of the 2011 - 2012 academic years in Adile Mermerci Anatolian High School. To get the information to determine the performance of students for <b>the</b> research, matrix <b>questions</b> gathered from ÖSS and MEB approved course books. The research has been made in order to prove whether <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in ÖSS exam and <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in MEB approved books are coherent or not. Students are asked to answer 14 <b>questions.</b> <b>The</b> data was analyzed by researchers jointly. The students have difficulties or couldn’t even answer <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of <b>the</b> topics of matrix questions related with logarithm and solving the equations. It had been seen that <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in MEB books, are similar with <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that had been published in the ÖSS Exam...|$|R
