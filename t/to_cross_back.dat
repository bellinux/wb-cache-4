5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. When they tried <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>back</b> the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the wood of Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group. During the running fight under the trees Juigné's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its ammunitions.|$|E
25|$|Tiernan {{said in his}} book, The Dublin Bombings and the Murder Triangle, {{that the}} Monaghan bombing, which took place 90 minutes after the Dublin explosions, was {{executed}} by loyalists working {{under the direction of}} Hanna. According to Tiernan, {{a few days before the}} bombing, Hanna had visited a pub in Portadown to check that everything was in place for the operation to be carried out. The Monaghan bombing had been organised as a diversionary tactic to draw Gardaí away from the border, enabling the bombers <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>back</b> into Northern Ireland undetected. According to submissions received by Mr. Justice Barron, the Monaghan bomb was assembled at the home of high-ranking UVF member Harris Boyle in Portadown.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, {{the force}} was {{involved}} in heavy fighting against strong Turkish defences; during a counter-attack it lost more than two batteries of artillery, which was captured by the advancing Turkish soldiers. On 1 May, 60th Division was supposed to attack Shunet Nimrin again but failures elsewhere caused the assault to be cancelled. Instead, the Australian Mounted Division which had advanced to occupy Es Salt, sent the 5th Mounted Brigade to attack Shunet Nimrin from the rear. To assist them, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to cut off any retreat from there northwards. The Australian attack faltered, partly in response to Turkish successes in the west, and by 20:00 they were still stationary. Another frontal assault by 60th (London) Division at 02:00 on 2 May also failed; by now the British position was turning more to defence than attack. In the three days since crossing the Jordan valley, the force {{had been involved in}} almost continuous fighting. On 3 May, yet another frontal attack by 60th Division failed and the ANZAC Division covering the flanks were confronted by growing numbers of Turkish troops. At 16:00 on 3 May, with an acceptance of the need to save his command, Chauvel ordered a withdrawal back from Es Salt to the Jordan valley. The last unit <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>back</b> across the Jordan was the New Zealand Brigade, leaving the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles as the east bank guard force, along with the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead.|$|E
50|$|Past this junction, {{the route}} becomes Mosside Boulevard and runs past {{businesses}} prior to heading into forested areas. The road briefly passes through Wall prior <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>back</b> into North Versailles Township and heading into commercial areas, turning northeast. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway and passes over Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line and Turtle Creek, entering Monroeville. Here, PA 48 becomes an undivided road {{as it comes}} to an intersection with PA 130. Following this, the road narrows to two lanes and passes through woods, curving more to the north. Farther north, the route enters commercial areas, widening into a four-lane road at the Haymarker Road intersection. PA 48 turns northwest, passing more businesses and reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with US 22 Business near an interchange that has access to I-376/US 22 and I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike).|$|R
5|$|The 27 {{minutes that}} had been played the {{previous}} day had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this he brought tall forward John Toshack into the starting team demoting the small build of Brian Hall to appearing only as a late substitute. In the 21st minute Peter Cormack's throw-in on the right fed Chris Lawler <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> post.

In general, this produces a plant that is healthier, stronger, or quicker growing than its predecessors.

500|$|With the {{crossing}} secured, the 161st (Essex) Brigade {{moved across the}} river to reinforce the defence. The Wellingtons established observation posts further to the north. The next morning the 2nd Squadron sent a patrol on a reconnaissance, which located a strong Turkish force approaching. By 05:30 this Turkish force were attacking the 2nd Squadron's posts. At 07:00 {{the rest of the}} regiment, still south of the river, moved to support the defenders at Kirbet Hadrah, where they came under an artillery bombardment. At the same time the 2nd Squadron was ordered to fall back to support the infantry at Sheikh Muannis. The Turks continued their assault, and at 08:15 had forced the infantry to withdraw south of the river. Holding out until 09:30, the last unit <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>back</b> over the river was the 2nd Squadron. In an attempt to keep possession of a crossing, the 6th and 9th Squadrons moved to cover the ford at the river mouth where they managed to stop the Turkish advance [...] short of the ford. That night the 161st Brigade took over all the defences, but the New Zealanders remained close by to support them. The regiment had twelve men wounded during the fighting. They remained in the area until 4 December, when the brigade left for Ibn Ibrak, to the south-east of Jaffa, relieving the ICCB in the front line. On 11 December the regiment was attached to the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Beit Dejan as the army tactical reserve. Ten days later they were back with the New Zealand brigade, which was now north of the River Auja. The regiment encountered the Turkish rearguard at Ferrekhiyeh, but after locating the Turks' positions, the regiment was ordered back to Beit Dejan. Then they were ordered to move back to Sukereir, arriving on Christmas Day 1917.|$|E

Thirty minutes earlier in Monaghan, an additional seven people were killed instantly or fatally injured by a fourth car bomb which had been delivered by a team from the Mid-Ulster UVF's Portadown unit. According to Joe Tiernan, this attack was carried out to draw the Gardaí away from the border, enabling the Dublin bombers <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>back</b> into Northern Ireland undetected.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans, {{unable to}} locate the SAS base, were aware {{that they could not}} be {{operating}} without the assistance of the local population. To gain information about the location of the SAS camp, all the male residents of Moussey between the ages of 16 and 60, a total of 210 men, were arrested. After being interrogated they were transported to concentration camps, from which only 70 returned after the war.

[...] In Butare, part of Kigali, and Kibungo to the south and southeast, the team reported indiscriminate massacres of civilians who had come to meetings convened by local government authorities, house-to-house killing of civilians, organized searches to kill civilians who were hiding in the brush, and ambushes of civilians attempted to flee across the border into Burundi. [...] The report concluded that [...] "the great majority of these killings had apparently not been motivated by any suspicion whatsoever of personal participation by victims in the massacres of Tutsi in April 1994." [...] Gersony's personal conclusion was that between April and August 1994, the RPF had killed [...] "between 25,000 and 45,000 persons, between 5,000 and 10,000 persons each month from April through July and 5,000 for the month of August." ...|$|E

After ten months, Zoya and her older sister, Nant Bwa Bwa Phan, were able to get to Mae Sot in Thailand for three months, hoping for a chance to go to a university in Australia; however, this fell through, and they decided to complete their education at another refugee camp, Mae La.

Both of them passed the first time; however, there was only enough space for Bwa Bwa, who went to Bangkok University, and Zoya had to retake the exam the following year. While waiting, she caught cerebral malaria, and almost died a second time.
