40|$|The {{performance}} of switched multibeam antennas for cellular radio systems is investigated when the <b>transmit</b> <b>amplifier</b> is of a multicarrier (MCPA) type.

It is shown by using Monte Carlo simulations how the downlink carrier to interference ratio depends on the frequency reuse distance and on the MCPA linearity measured as its noise power ratio (NPR). For reuse factor one systems, which is made possible by use of multibeam antennas, the linear co-channel interference dominates the interference. On the contrary, for a reuse factor seven system it is shown that a weak nonlinearity directly gives a degradation in carrier to interference ratio (CIR) due to intermodulation distortion.

40|$|An {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) system operating over {{a wireless communication channel}} effectively forms {{a number of}} parallel frequency-nonselective fading channels, thereby obviating the need for complex equalization and thus greatly simplifying equalization/decoding. However, the OFDM system also exhibits two weaknesses relative to its single-carrier counterparts: (1) the diversity achieved by the OFDM system can be less than a single-carrier system employing the same error control code in a signaling environment rich in diversity and (2) the baseband transmitted signal can exhibit significant amplitude fluctuation over time, thereby precluding efficient <b>transmit</b> <b>amplifier</b> operation. In this paper, nonstandard multidimensional signal sets matched to the OFDM framework are prescribed that address both of these issues. The proposed signal sets are chosen to maximize the diversity achieved by an uncoded system under a constraint to control the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the baseband transmitted waveform. The cost of employing the proposed signal sets is an increase in decoding complexity, as essentially a small amount of controlled equalization has been added to the receiver; thus, the resulting system {{can be viewed as a}} hybrid between an OFDM system and a standard single-carrier system. Numerical results are presented which suggest that: (1) the system can provide an attractive alternative to a standard OFDM system in terms of required average transmitted SNR versus receiver complexity and (2) the system yields a modest reduction in PMEPR versus a standard OFDM syste...|$|E
40|$|A major {{limitation}} in any high-performance {{digital communication}} {{system is the}} linearity region of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Nonlinearities typically lead to signal clipping. Efficient communication in such conditions requires maintaining a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) in the transmitted signal while achieving a high throughput of data. Excessive PAR leads either to frequent clipping or to inadequate resolution in the analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters. Currently proposed signaling schemes for future generation wireless communications suffer from a high PAR. This paper presents a new signaling scheme for channels with clipping which achieves a PAR as low as 3. For a given linear range in the transmitter 2 ̆ 7 s digital-to-analog converter, this scheme achieves a lower bit-error rate than existing multicarrier schemes, owing to increased separation between constellation points.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the use of multiple antenna elements in wireless communication over frequency non-selective radio channels. Both measurement results and theoretical analysis are presented. New transmit strategies are derived and compared to existing transmit strategies, such as beamforming and space time block coding (STBC). It is found that the best transmission algorithm is largely dependent on the channel characteristics, such as the number of transmit and receive antennas and the existence of a line of sight component. Rayleigh fading multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels are studied using an eigenvalue analysis and exact expressions for the bit error rates and outage capacities for beamforming and STBC is found. In general are MIMO fading channels correlated and there exists a mutual coupling between antenna elements. These findings are supported by indoor MIMO measurements. It is found that the mutual coupling can, in some scenarios, increase the outage capacity. An adaptive antenna testbed is used to obtain measurement results for the SIMO channel. The results are analyzed and design guidelines are obtained for how a beamformer implemented in hardware shall be constructed.

40|$|Use of {{companding}} for peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) {{control is}} explored for a link involving a non-linear transmit power amplifier with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Specifically, {{the objective of}} the study was to determine if companding using u-law compression/expansion at the transmitter/receiver, respectively, provides end-to-end performance gains relative to a system without companding. We consider the use of companding to ameliorate the impact of nonlinearities in the <b>transmit</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In the absence of companding, transmitter operation near saturation raises the signal level at the receiver but, because of the nonlinearities in the amplifier response, also results in distortion that impacts overall link performance. As the transmit power is backed-off from saturation, amplifier distortion is reduced, but error components due to lower SNR at the receiver become more significant. When companding is introduced in the system, the system is able to operate closer to saturation without substantial transmit distortion. However, requisite expansion of the compressed signal at the receiver yields noise amplification which can counteract any of the performance gains that would otherwise accrue from the increased SNR at the receiver. At issue is whether or not operating conditions exist (e. g., backoff, SNR, amplifier linearity model, etc) for which companding enhances the end-to-end performance relative to the link performance without companding. System simulation models were employed using Rapp’s nonlinear power amplification models, where average symbol distance errors were used as performance metrics. We found that companding can provide very modest performance gains in comparison to systems that do not employ companding. Performance trends were corroborated in a hardware testbed with an amplifier chain, where average bit error rates were experimentally determined...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) issue, which {{typically}} affects the digital transmission on power line communication (PLC) systems. In these systems, the power line is exploited as a communication multicarriers channel, where the sub-channels are made mutually independent by using orthogonal frequencies (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or OFDM). Each component carries a string of bits associated with both amplitude and phase, which then represents the routed information. On the other hand, depending on the phases of the sub-carriers, the OFDM signal which has to be transmitted could present high instantaneous peaks. These peaks could saturate the <b>transmitting</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> modifying {{the shape of the}} OFDM symbol and then affecting its information content. Furthermore, such spikes give rise to electromagnetic compatibility issues for the electric devices. In this paper, the selected mapping (SLM) method is applied to mitigate the PAPR phenomenon. This method consists in shifting the phases of the components in order to minimize the amplitude of the peaks. The determination of the optimal set of phase shifts is a very complex problem, so that the SLM approaches proposed in the literature all resort to iterative algorithms to solve it. On the other hand, as this calculation has to be performed online, both the computational cost and the effect on the bit error rate (BER) cannot be established a priori.
