5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2015, the {{citizens}} of Greece voted decisively (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout) to reject a referendum <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures. As {{a result of this}} vote, Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July. Negotiations between Greece and other Eurozone members will continue in the following days to procure funds from the European Central Bank in order to prevent an economic collapse in the country.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said}} that they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels {{defeated}} the Yale Bulldogs 9074 in the NCAA East Regional Quarterfinal {{in order to}} advance to the semifinal against Canisius College. North Carolina won the game by twelve points, which allowed them {{to move on to the}} NCAA East Regional Final against Syracuse. The final, along with the semifinal, were held at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Syracuse Orange fell to the Tar Heels 6758 as the Tar Heels advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar Heels opponent for the national semifinal was Michigan State. The Tar Heels were tied with the Spartans as time was winding down in regulation. Michigan State's Jack Quiggle made a half court shot <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the Spartans the lead, but the shot left his hands after time expired, nullifying the basket. In the first overtime, Michigan State had a two-point lead with eleven seconds remaining, while also having a player at the foul line. The Spartan missed both shots and Tar Heel Brennan gathered the rebound, dribbled down the court, and made a shot as time expired to send the game to a second overtime. The Tar Heels pulled away in the third overtime to win the game 7470. The game saw the lead change thirtyone times before the Tar Heels were able to emerge victorious after three overtime periods.|$|E

25|$|Other liberals {{suggested}} a highly decentralized confederation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> only certain limited powers {{to the union}} government.

25|$|Dodgers {{ownership}} {{was thrown}} into question on December 7, when the Judge in Frank McCourt's divorce case against Jamie McCourt invalidated an agreement <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> McCourt sole ownership of the Dodgers. McCourt vowed to try some other legal options to keep himself as sole owner of the team.|$|E

25|$|Peruvian {{historian}} Basadre {{states that}} one of Peru's reasons for signing the treaty was to impede a Chile-Bolivia alliance against Peru <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> to Bolivia the region of Arica (the vast majority of Bolivian commerce went through Peruvian ports of Arica before the war) and transferred Antofagasta to Chile. These Chilean offers to Bolivia, to change allegiance, were made several times even {{during the war and}} also from the Bolivian side at least six times.|$|E
25|$|In July 2006 the Alabama-Coushatta sued {{lobbyist}} Jack Abramoff and {{his associates}} for attempts to defraud the tribe in seeking to defeat state legislation in 2001 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them authority to run the casino. The tribe claimed the lobbyists had hidden their motives in representing the competing Coushatta of Louisiana, which ran their own casino, and mobilized Christian groups in an underhanded way. A Senate investigation in 2006 revealed that several tribes were defrauded of {{tens of millions of}} dollars by Abramoff and associates on issues associated with Indian gaming.|$|E
25|$|Waugh {{failed to}} pass 25 in the rain-affected draw in the Third Test at Sydney, before {{claiming}} career-best bowling figures of 5/40 in a losing team during the second innings of the Fourth Test at Adelaide. In the Fifth Test at the WACA, Waugh scored 88 in the first innings before returning as a runner for the injured Craig McDermott. He was run out in a mix-up with his brother while looking for the single <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Steve his century. This left his brother on 99 not out with Australia all out. Waugh contributed a further three wickets as Australia completed a 3–1 series win.|$|E

50|$|Fearing <b>that</b> Vessantara <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> {{away his}} wife as well, God Śakra intervened and in disguise, asked for his wife Maddi, which Vessantara readily gave him as well.

25|$|Following {{two short}} running plays, Thomas threw a 16-yard pass to Coale {{for a first}} down. On the ensuing play, David Wilson ran 32 yards for a first down to Michigan's 24-yard line. Josh Ogelsby {{followed}} Wilson's run with an 11-yard run of his own. Ogelsby then rushed for five yards and one-yard respectively. Thomas followed these plays with a three-yard rush, setting up a fourth-and-one at the Michigan 4-yard line. Instead of kicking the field goal <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Tech a 9–0 lead, Frank Beamer {{decided to go for}} the first down. Thomas was stopped for no gain and Tech turned the ball over on downs.|$|E
25|$|The WICB {{announced}} its central contracts in November 2009, and Sammy {{was included in}} the 33-man list. He was given a GradeB contract (the second-highest level) worth $80,000. His career-best Man of the Match figures of 4–26 in the third ODI in Saint Vincent & the Grenadines would have been more flattering still had captain Chris Gayle been able to hold on to a catch <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the tall Saint Lucian the distinction of becoming the first West Indian to take a five-fer in every form of the game; he had 5–26 off the same opponents in a Twenty20 International earlier in the series. West Indies bowled Zimbabwe for 104, having made 245.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress promised {{officers}} {{they would}} receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on 21 October 1780. The army was well aware that Congress had {{made no effort to}} back up this promise. In January 1783, a committee of officers drew up a petition listing their grievances and Alexander McDougall presented it to Congress in company with Matthias Ogden and John Brooks. Differing from earlier petitions, this one spoke for the entire army, not just the officer corps. Behind the scenes, Washington wrote to members of Congress that the officers' claims were legitimate. Unfortunately, the Congress defeated a measure <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the officers full pay for five years as compensation for the promised pension.|$|E

25|$|Sun News Network (commonly {{shortened}} to Sun News) was a Canadian English language Category C {{news channel}} owned by Québecor Média through {{a partnership between}} two of its subsidiaries, TVA Group (which maintained 51% majority ownership of the company) and Sun Media Corporation (which held the remaining 49% interest). The channel was launched on April 18, 2011 in standard and high definition and shut down February 13, 2015. It operated under a Category 2 (later classified as Category C) licence granted by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in November 2010, after the network aborted a highly publicized attempt for a Category 1 licence (later classified as Category A) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> it mandatory access on digital cable and satellite providers across Canada.|$|E
25|$|On Philadelphia's next drive, {{the referees}} made two suspect decisions. The {{first was a}} non-call on a very obvious {{facemask}} on Brian Westbrook <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, {{not the other way}} around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54.|$|E
25|$|Davis' second term, {{which lasted}} only ten months, was {{dominated}} by the recall election. Davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign, including one granting drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants. Davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners {{many of the same}} rights as married people. He vetoed legislation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college. Many of Davis' opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration. Some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from Hispanics, labor union members and liberal Democrats. Ultimately, Davis did not have as much support from Hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his 2002 re-election.|$|E
