40|$|The {{emergence}} of high speed wide area networks makes grid computing a reality. However grid applications that need reliable data transfer still have difficulties to achieve optimal TCP performance due to network tuning of TCP window size to improve bandwidth {{and to reduce}} latency on a high speed wide area network. This paper presents a Java package called JPARSS (Java Parallel Secure Stream (Socket)) that divides data into partitions that are sent over several parallel Java streams simultaneously and allows Java or Web applications to achieve optimal TCP performance in a grid environment without the necessity of tuning TCP window size. This package enables single sign-on, certificate delegation and secure or plaintext data transfer using several security components based on X. 509 certificate and SSL. Several experiments {{will be presented to}} show that using Java parallel streams is more effective than tuning TCP window size. In addition a simple architecture using Web services to facilitate peer to peer and <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>file</b> transfer will be presented. ...|$|E
