5|$|At Will Bloom’s wedding party, {{his father}} Edward recalls <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>Will</b> was born, {{claiming}} he caught an enormous catfish using his wedding ring as bait. Will, having heard these stories all his life, believes {{them to be}} lies and falls out with his father. Three years later, Edward is stricken with cancer, so Will and his pregnant French wife Joséphine return to his childhood home in Alabama {{to spend time with}} his father. Edward’s life is told through flashbacks, beginning with his encounter with a witch in his hometown, Ashton. She shows him his death but he reacts to it without fear. As he grows into adulthood, he finds his home too confining, and sets out into the world with a misunderstood giant, Karl, who has come to town with a traveling circus.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Yes Minister, {{there are}} many {{occasions}} when Hacker is portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, and prone to blunders that embarrass him or his party, eliciting bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the Chief Whip. He is continually concerned with what the newspapers of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>will</b> {{have to say about}} him, and is always hoping to be promoted by the Prime Minister. (Hacker ran the unsuccessful campaign for a political ally during the party's last leadership election - his man lost, becoming Foreign Secretary, and leaving Hacker nervous about his prospects under the winner, now Prime Minister.) He is equally afraid of either staying at his current level of Cabinet seniority, or being demoted.|$|E

500|$|Lettuce grows best in {{full sun}} in loose, nitrogen-rich soils with a pH of between 6.0 and 6.8. Heat {{generally}} prompts lettuce to bolt, with most varieties growing poorly above cool temperatures prompt better performance, with [...] being preferred and as low as [...] being tolerated. Plants in hot areas that are provided partial shade during the hottest part of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>will</b> bolt more slowly. Temperatures above [...] will generally result in poor or non-existent germination of lettuce seeds. After harvest, lettuce lasts the longest when kept at [...] and 96 percent humidity. Lettuce quickly degrades when stored with fruit such as apples, pears and bananas that release the ripening agent ethylene gas. The high water content of lettuce (94.9 percent) creates problems when attempting to preserve the plant– it cannot be successfully frozen, canned or dried and must be eaten fresh.|$|E

With her next two British films—Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of Love on the Dole, [...] "is not {{within a mile of}} Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in <b>The</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Will</b> Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E

2500|$|Branch Rickey, a 1903 {{graduate}} of Ohio Wesleyan, {{is regarded as}} a significant figure in the history of professional baseball for breaking the sport's racial barrier. An racial incident early in Rickey's life when he was as a baseball coach for Ohio Wesleyan in 1910 would {{play an important role in}} his decision thirty years later. Rickey's team visited a hotel in South Bend, Indiana, where the hotel manager refused to provide a room for Rickey's black baseball player Charley Thomas. Rickey eventually convinced the manager to allow him to share his own room with Thomas. Rickey recalled Thomas rubbing at his hands, ashamed of the color of his skin and vowed, [...] "Charley, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>will</b> come when they won't have to be white." [...] In 1943 Rickey became president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Beginning with the 1946 signing of African American player Jackie Robinson for the Dodgers, Rickey became renowned for his role in the racial integration of the game. Rickey's feelings on integration were a primary motivating factor in his decision.|$|E
