The role of the division was as a second wave to exploit the expected success. After the breach of the German lines, the Reserve Army cavalry divisions would capture Bapaume.

5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>for</b> distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
