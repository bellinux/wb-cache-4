Feldstein reported the results of his audience with the czar to Gaines, who was furious and immediately picked up <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> <b>called</b> Murphy. 'This is ridiculous!' he bellowed. 'I'm going to call a press conference on this. You have no grounds, no basis, to do this. I'll sue you'. Murphy made what he surely thought was a gracious concession. 'All right. Just take off the beads of sweat'. At that, Gaines and Feldstein both went ballistic. 'Fuck you!' they shouted into the telephone in unison. Murphy hung up on them, but the story ran in its original form.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{depicted}} a human astronaut, {{a representative of}} the Galactic Republic, visiting the planet Cybrinia inhabited by robots. He finds the robots divided into functionally identical orange and blue races, one of which has fewer rights and privileges than the other. The astronaut decides that due to the robots' bigotry, the Galactic Republic should not admit the planet. In the final panel, he removes his helmet, revealing himself to be a black man. Murphy demanded, without any authority in the Code, that the black astronaut had to be removed. As Diehl recounted in Tales from the Crypt: The Official Archives: This really made 'em go bananas in the Code czar's office. 'Judge Murphy was off his nut.

'F**k you!' they shouted into the telephone in unison. Murphy hung up on them, but the story ran in its original form. Feldstein, interviewed for the book Tales of Terror: The EC Companion, reiterated his recollection of Murphy making the request: So he said it can't be a Black person. So I said, 'For God's sakes, Judge Murphy, that's the whole point of the Goddamn story!' So he said, 'No, it can't be a Black'. Bill Gaines just called him up later and raised the roof, and finally they said, 'Well, you gotta take the perspiration off'. I had the stars glistening in the perspiration on his Black skin. Bill said, 'F**k you', and he hung up. Although the story would eventually be reprinted uncensored, the incident caused Gaines to abandon comic books and concentrate on Mad magazine, which was EC's only profitable title.|$|E

Louis starts with a brief introduction of AGCO, and his feeling that the automotive industry could be doing better. After toiling for 10 years with various philosophies, it was the 1980 NBC documentary 2 ̆ 2 If Japan Can, Why Can 2 ̆ 7 t We 2 ̆ 2 that hit home with him.

His biggest 2 ̆ 2 aha 2 ̆ 2 moment was that 2 ̆ 2 I was the problem. 2 ̆ 2 Once he realized this, he called a meeting to apologize and things started to get better right away. Louis removed everyone from the 2 ̆ 2 flat rate 2 ̆ 2 pay system {{and put them on}} salary.

The annual revenues in 2002 exceeded 250 million dollars, far above expectations, given the weak nature of the current economy. The Software Engineering Group is central to DOTA as all the code for client software is either written or tested in that department. In addition, the group offers on-line and telephone based software support to many of the clients. The individuals in the Software Engineering department are highly paid with the average salary to be around 110, 000 dollars. In addition, bonuses {{at the end of the}} year can add almost 50 % more pay for the workers in the department. Mike Thompson, President of Digital Omega Tech Alpha (DOTA) International Services, could not believe his ears. Lisa Connors, the HR director at DOTA had just informed him that a third woman in the Software Engineering group had filed charges of sexual harassment with the EEOC.
