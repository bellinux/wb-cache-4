25|$|Until 1995, Israel's {{trade with}} the Arab world was minimal due to the Arab League boycott, which was begun against the Jewish {{community}} of Palestine in 1945. Arab nations not only refused to have direct trade with Israel (the primary boycott), but they also refused {{to do business with}} any corporation that operated in Israel (secondary boycott), or any corporation that did business with a corporation that did business with Israel (<b>tertiary</b> <b>boycott).</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of the first <b>tertiary</b> <b>boycott</b> the Arab League became {{increasingly}} demanding of uninvolved states to adhere to its boycott of Israel. In 1958 the boycott was expanded to prohibit all goods exported from a third state identical to goods imported by the state from Israel, including goods produced with Israeli raw materials or components. In the same year, ships visiting an Arab port and an Israeli port within the same trip were blacklisted.|$|E
25|$|By 1953 the Arab boycott was a {{well-established}} feature {{of international trade}} relations, and becoming more brazen. In early 1953 the first reports were released about Arab attempts to make American and European airlines boycott Israel by refusing to service Israelis or land in Israel, or at a minimum to not invest in Israel. This <b>tertiary</b> <b>boycott</b> marked another fundamental shift in boycott policy wherein Arab states would pressure third party states to agree to boycott Israel. However, these rudimentary efforts were unsuccessful and the airline boycotts remained isolated to the Arab world.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} boycott {{activities}} intensified, and gained {{a new and}} highly powerful ally — the Soviet Union. During Israel's early years it was seen by the USSR as a potential ally due to the significant socialist aspirations advocated by its founders and applied in its conception. The Soviet Union {{was one of the}} first countries to recognize Israel de jure upon its establishment in 1948. However, as Israel's democratic nature became evident and its ties with Western states were solidified, the Soviet Union would view Israel as an enemy in the West vs. East dichotomy of the Cold War. Instead, the Soviet Union would form an alliance with the revolutionary Arab regimes, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and later in the decade Iraq, united in anti-American and anti-Israel political objectives. The clout of the Soviet Union gave the boycott new international legitimacy and guaranteed anti-boycott resolutions a veto at the UN Security Council. The <b>tertiary</b> <b>boycott,</b> formerly ignored as an affront to international trade relations, became enforceable through the sheer political and economic power of the Soviet Union. In 1958, Air France capitulated to Arab League demands after being denied overflight and landing rights in Arab states for eighteen months due to its alleged investment in Israeli development projects.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, a {{year after}} it signed a peace treaty with Israel, Jordan lifted its boycott. The Palestinian Authority {{likewise}} agreed not {{to abide by the}} boycott that same year. In 1994 several of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf abandoned the secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>boycotts.</b> The period also saw [...] "low-level diplomatic relations" [...] between Israel and Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, and Qatar. In 1994, following the Oslo Peace Accords, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) states, ended their participation in the Arab boycott against Israel. The move prompted a surge of investment in Israel, and resulted in the initiation of joint cooperation projects between Israel and Arab countries. In 1996, the GCC states recognized that total elimination of the boycott is a necessary step for peace and economic development in the region. Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia do not enforce the boycott. Mauritania, which never applied the boycott, established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999. Saudi Arabia had pledged to end its economic boycott as a condition for membership in the World Trade Organization but came back on the promise following its acceptance into the organization in December 11, 2005.|$|R
