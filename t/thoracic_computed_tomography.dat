40|$|AbstractThe cardiac {{structures}} are well seen on nongated <b>thoracic</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> {{studies in the}} investigation and follow-up of cardiopulmonary disease. A wide variety of findings can be incidentally picked up on careful evaluation of the pericardium, cardiac chambers, valves, and great vessels. Some of these findings may represent benign variants, whereas others may have more profound clinical importance. Furthermore, the expansion of interventional and surgical practice {{has led to the}} development and placement of new cardiac stents, implantable pacemaker devices, and prosthetic valves with which the practicing radiologist should be familiar. We present a collection of common incidental cardiac findings that can be readily identified on <b>thoracic</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> studies and briefly discuss their clinical relevance...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Tracheal {{diverticulum}} (DV) is an incidental {{finding in}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> examinations.

Materials and Methods: For the study, 299 patients from a total number of 12 800 patients who underwent a <b>thoracic</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> examination were included. Tracheal diverticula were evaluated for localization, size, contour, wall thickness and commu-nication with the tracheal lumen.

40|$|M 5 L, a Web-based Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) {{system to}} {{automatically}} detect lung nodules in <b>thoracic</b> <b>Computed</b> <b>Tomographies,</b> {{is based on}} a multi-thread analysis by independent subsystems and the combination of their results. The validation on 1043 scans of 3 independent data-sets showed consistency across data-sets, with a sensitivity of about 80 % in the 4 - 8 range of False Positives per scan, despite varying acquisition and reconstruction parameters and annotation criteria. To make M 5 L CAD available to users without hardware or software new installations and configuration, a Software as a Service (SaaS) approach was adopted. A web front-end handles the work (image upload, results notification and direct on-line annotation by radiologists) and the communication with the OpenNebula-based cloud infrastructure, that allocates virtual computing and storage resources. The exams uploaded through the web interface are anonymised and analysis is performed in an isolated and independent cloud environment. The average processing time for case is about 20 minutes and up to 14 cases can be processed in parallel. Preliminary results on the on-going clinical validation shows that the M 5 L CAD adds 20 % more nodules originally overlooked by radiologists, allowing a remarkable increase of the overall detection sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ectopia of the {{pancreatic}} tissue is a developmental anomaly found in ~ 2 % of all autopsies, and 70 ~ 90 % of these anomalies {{are located in}} the gastrointestinal tract. Mediastinal localization of an ectopic pancreas is extremely rare. Herein, we report two cases with mediastinal ectopic pancreas clari-fied by pathology and shown by <b>thoracic</b> contrast‑enhanced <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, a brief review of the relevant literatures is presented. Although CT and MRI manifestations of this lesion are nonspecific, certain notable findings need to be focused on.

40|$|Purpose: To prospectively {{study the}} effects of loco-regional {{radiotherapy}} in women with breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Thirty consecutive patients with breast resection underwent clinical, lung function, radiographic, and <b>thoracic</b> high-resolution <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> evaluation before and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was also administered to 15 patients. Results: Nineteen patients reported mild respiratory symptoms at 1 month, which resolved completely at 6 months after radiotherapy. Opacities were present on 80 % of chest radiographs and in all patients on high-resolution <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> by 3 months. These opacities became compact and persisted on high-resolution <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> at 12 months. Lung function indices, including FEV 1, FVC, TLC, and DLCO, progressively declined after radiotherapy, and was irreversible at 12 months (p 0. 05). Conclusions: Our results have shown that adjuvant loco-regional radiotherapy, a common practice in breast cancer treatment, is associated with irreversible reduction in lung function parameters. These changes are accompanied by radiological evidence of persistent lung injury. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the incidence and long-term pulmonary sequelae of current treatment for breast cancer.
