5|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> {{and inside}} sleeve by Paul Postle depict sulphur fields in Iceland, {{where much of}} the album was recorded. Postle also took photos of the band rehearsing for the gatefold.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> {{on early}} prints of the CD {{featured}} a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints {{for fear of}} litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover.</b> Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.|$|E

5|$|For the album's {{striking}} front-cover image, Wilkes used a Kirlian {{photograph of}} Harrison's hand holding a Hindu medallion. The photo was taken at UCLA's parapsychology department, {{as was the}} shot used on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover,</b> where Harrison instead holds three US coins: a couple of quarters and a silver dollar.|$|E
5|$|On some vinyl {{pressings}} of the album, {{the cover}} does not crop off their feet. On the Deluxe Edition case the feet are presented on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover,</b> {{and the band}} sold an official T-shirt with {{a shot of the}} band's feet after the deluxe edition release.|$|E

5000|$|... "Dell's {{most memorable}} design {{innovation}} {{was not on}} the front but on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>covers</b> ... <b>the</b> entire <b>back</b> <b>covers</b> given over to maps, or variously charts, blueprints, or what have you to represent story locale or scene of the crime: a stretch of California highway, the interior of an apartment, a sheik's [...] "city of stones". It was an enjoyable if slightly goofy gimmick and, amazingly, managed to last nearly ten years." ...|$|R
5|$|O'Donnell hired Chalkie Davies, a {{photographer}} for New Musical Express {{for two weeks}} to photograph the band on a US tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for the album artwork. The front cover, featuring Lynott in the foreground, was originally supposed to be <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> as the group wanted equal coverage of all members. O'Donnell disagreed and reversed {{the front and back}} photographs at the last minute. The album had a working title of Thin Lizzy Live but Lynott decided that Live and Dangerous was better.|$|E
5|$|Pertec {{was eager}} to {{increase}} sales to small businesses through the 26 Altair Computer stores across the United States. The marketing toward hobby/home user was curtailed. The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. There was one more issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, always carried a full page Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the album's artwork was by Hipgnosis, the company {{responsible}} for previous Wings album covers such as Venus and Mars (1975) and the recent Wings Greatest compilation (1978). The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room, looking down through space at Planet Earth through an open hatchway in the floor; the picture was taken by photographer John Shaw at his London studio. Photos of the individual band members appeared on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover,</b> credited to Linda and Paul McCartney.|$|E

50|$|The {{photograph}} on the album's cover is of John Cohen and shows visual artist Mary Frank (spouse of Robert Frank), circa 1960. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover's</b> photograph features artist Red Grooms crossing Third Avenue in 1960.|$|R
5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|The title Leave Home {{refers to}} the Ramones leaving New York City to go on tour around the world. The album cover was {{designed}} by Moshe Brakha, {{who had worked with}} the Rolling Stones to yield the Black and Blue (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> of the album was a drawing of a bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band's logo.|$|E
5|$|Leave Home is {{the second}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on January 10, 1977, through Sire Records, with the expanded CD being released through Rhino Entertainment on June 19, 2001. Songs on the album were written immediately after the band's first album's writing process, which demonstrated the band's progression. The album had a higher production value than their debut Ramones and featured faster tempos. The front photo was taken by Moshe Brakha and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover,</b> which would become the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. The album spawned three singles, but only one succeeded in charting. It was also promoted with several tour dates in the United States and Europe.|$|E

50|$|Besides Heaven's {{perspective}} in the story, the books include illustrations, newspaper reports, and other characters' entries. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>covers</b> of <b>the</b> books include the same short description for the series, {{followed by another}} description for the specific book.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with differing}} cover art, each obi strip {{contained}} {{a piece of}} an image, which when put together in order, would reveal a full picture of Kumi. The same was done for <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>covers</b> of each single.|$|R
5|$|The album cover, {{photographed by}} Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, {{features}} the four members {{leaning against a}} brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since {{become one of the}} most imitated album covers of all time. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E
5|$|The band carried on, {{adding new}} members Chuck Leavell on piano and Lamar Williams on bass. Brothers and Sisters was largely {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three months at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, Georgia. Lead guitarist Dickey Betts assumed the role of band leader, and many of his compositions reflected a more country-inspired sound. Session musicians Les Dudek and Tommy Talton sat in to play guitar on several songs. The album was being produced {{at the same time as}} vocalist/organist Gregg Allman's solo debut, Laid Back, and features many of the same musicians and engineers. The front album cover features a photograph of Vaylor Trucks, the son of drummer Butch Trucks and his wife Linda. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> features a photograph of Brittany Oakley, the daughter of Berry Oakley and his wife, Linda.|$|E

50|$|The Transsexual News Telegraph was a {{quarterly}} news and topics magazine published in United States from 1991 to 2002. TNT covers often portrayed Trans Identities or Art and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>covers</b> were usually {{a piece of}} graphic art with a thought provoking theme.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} book displays Potter's willingness {{to exploit the}} commercial possibilities of her characters and tales. The purchaser was alerted {{to the existence of}} other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed to a list of books on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover.</b> Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E
5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover.</b> The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Jeff Hanneman was {{surprised}} by Rubin's interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts Run DMC and LL Cool J. During a visit by Slagel to a European music convention, Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with. Following the agreement, Friedman brought the band members to Seattle for two days of publicity shots, possible record shots, and photos for a tour book; Rubin felt no good photos of the band had been taken before that point. One of the photos was used on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> of the band's 1988 release South of Heaven. The album became an American Recordings album after Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It {{was one of only}} two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of the original distributor's refusal to release work by the band.|$|E

50|$|The Fold-In {{has since}} become one of Mads {{signature}} features, and has appeared in almost every issue of the magazine from 1964-2017. A single issue in 1977 was published without a Fold-In (though Jaffee supplied <b>the</b> issues <b>back</b> <b>cover),</b> and a 1980 issue instead featured a unique double-visual gimmick by Jaffee in which <b>the</b> inside <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> and <b>the</b> outside <b>back</b> <b>cover</b> merged to create a third image when held up to the light. The third-ever Fold-In in 1964 featured a unique diagonal folding design, rather than the standard left-right vertical format. The image revealed the four members of The Beatles becoming bald (and thus losing their popularity).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} LP had a faux {{white leather}} sleeve designed by Tom Hardy, {{better known as}} guitarist Lester Square. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>cover's</b> liner notes featured raves about the band from various critics from around the world, including London, New York, San Francisco, Japan and Kansas.|$|R
