25|$|Reptiles have {{quiescent}} periods {{similar to}} mammalian sleep, and {{a decrease in}} electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have been asleep. However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in mammals and other animals. In reptiles, sleep time increases following sleep deprivation, and stronger stimuli are needed to awaken the animals when they have been deprived of sleep as compared <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have slept normally. This suggests that the sleep which follows deprivation is compensatorily deeper.|$|E
25|$|The Zuchtverband für das Ostfriesische und Alt-Oldenburger Pferd e.V. ("Association for the Breeding of East Freisian and Old-Oldenburg Horses") {{was founded}} in 1986, and was {{recognized}} as an independent organization in 1988. Even after 20 years of hiatus, {{the goal is to}} produce a heavy, quality horse, responsive with an exceptionally good temperament. The unique character of the former farm horse is of paramount importance, as it was the peasant farms that led such kind horses to be bred in the first place. The breeding objective these days stretches back before the horses were called to haul tractors and artillery, <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were heavy, elegant, and impressive Karossiers.|$|E
25|$|Example 7. Ultimately {{periodic}} sequences, sequences {{that become}} periodic {{after an initial}} finite bout of lawlessness. They constitute a proper extension of Example 5 (meaning that Example 5 is a proper subalgebra of Example 7) and also of Example 4, since constant sequences are periodic with period one. Sequences may vary as <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> settle down, but any finite set of sequences will all eventually settle down no later than their slowest-to-settle member, whence ultimately periodic sequences are closed under all Boolean operations and so form a Boolean algebra. This example has the same atoms and coatoms as Example 4, whence it is not atomless and therefore not isomorphic to Example 5/6. However it contains an infinite atomless subalgebra, namely Example 5, and so is not isomorphic to Example 4, every subalgebra of which must be a Boolean algebra of finite sets and their complements and therefore atomic. This example is isomorphic to the direct product of Examples 4 and 5, furnishing another description of it.|$|E

25|$|Five {{independent}} {{witnesses were}} called to testify {{on behalf of the}} defense as to Collins' whereabouts on the dates Karen Sue Beineman had disappeared and her body had been found. Four of these witnesses were employees of a motorcycle sales firm which Collins had visited on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance. Each testified on August 6. The timing of these four witnesses' recollections as to when Collins had actually entered the motorcycle shop varied slightly, although consensus among three of these men was that he had entered the premises as they were eating lunch, which they typically did anytime between one and two p.m. Upon cross-examination, the time factor of these witnesses as <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had actually seen Collins expanded to between noon and two p.m. Two of these employees had signed statements affirming the time Collins had entered their premises was approximately two p.m., although one of these witnesses stated he had been repeatedly harassed by an Ann Arbor Police Sergeant as to the actual time he had seen Collins.|$|E
25|$|This {{is an area}} {{within the}} visual cortex that {{has been found to}} play an {{important}} role in the target selection of saccades. In other words, this area is important for determining which objects our eyes shift <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> move. Studies have shown that there is a large amount of activation within the visual area V4 before the saccade even takes place. This occurs in the form of shrinking receptive fields. The receptive fields of these brain cells tend to shift towards the object that the eye is about to move towards, generally more so if the object is close to the original fixation point. This dynamic change in receptive fields is thought to enhance the perception and recognition of objects in a visual scene. Because the receptive fields become smaller around the targeted objects, attention within the visual scene is very focused on these objects. Increased attention to target objects within a visual scene help direct eye movements from one object to another. Understanding of the visual scene becomes more efficient because these attention shifts guide the eyes towards relevant objects as opposed to objects that may not be as important.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple venipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or resident available.|$|E

[...] "Illmatic" [...] he writes, [...] "mobilized a national network of dissidents craving something true to the streets but eager to distance themselves from what was beginning to be perceived as a scourge – gangster rap." [...] According to Caramanica, Nas' debut was received by these fans as a [...] "rebuke" [...] towards trends that were beginning to shape mainstream rap: [...] "the pop crossover, the exuberant production values, [...] the splintering of rap into [...] and concerned wings." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Thompson, a {{professor}} of communications {{and director of the}} Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told The New York Times, [...] "There is something kind of unique about [...] It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture–including kids' shows like the Rugrats. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive–deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it". In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show's adult audience: [...] " [...] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> watched TV in their footie [...] On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the frames."
