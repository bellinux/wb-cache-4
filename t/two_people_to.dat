5|$|On the Droits de l'Homme, many {{survivors}} {{were too}} weak to reach the boats, {{and a number of}} men fell from the hull and drowned in the attempt. Many more could not find room in the small boats, and only 150 men were rescued on 17January. The following morning, when the boats returned, they found only 140survivors left, at least as many again having died during the night. The last <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> leave the ship were the commanders General Humbert and Commodore Lacrosse. Taken to Brest, the survivors were fed and clothed and given medical treatment. All the surviving prisoners from the Cumberland were released and returned to Britain, in recognition of their efforts to save lives from the shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{heavy rains}} caused <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> drown in Charlotte. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek, {{and a woman}} drowned while in her car. Also in North Carolina, {{tropical}} rains related to Danny caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek, spilling about 2,500 gallons (9,500L) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Island, and parts of Cape Cod, {{in addition to the}} coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts. The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension happening on the service to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{tries to}} wend {{its way through}} the trail of human debris, the visions and the {{shattered}} dreams {{on both sides of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to a rational analysis of the applicability of international human rights norms, to the conflicting claims of <b>two</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>to</b> the same land. The right of both Jews and Palestinians to self-determination seems to be self-evident from the stories of the <b>two</b> <b>peoples.</b> Almost forty years after the Six Days War, the author turns to this issue in an attempt to analyze where this conflict now stands in terms of international human rights. This article will concentrate on structuring a basic analytical framework, incorporating both Israeli and Palestinian perspectives, and will try to show the symmetries and asymmetries between them. This involves discussion of the rights of <b>two</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>to</b> self-determination and the means by which such parallel rights can be implemented. It also involves discussing differences in the means of implementation of the right to self-determination for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and minority rights for Palestinian-Israelis living in Israel within the 1948 Armistice Lines...|$|R
25|$|When {{the time}} for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in {{nomination}} of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate {{for president of the}} political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. In New Jersey, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in North Carolina, the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.|$|E

25|$|Some {{missions}} {{permit the}} player {{to use the}} dragon Saphira in combat. The gameplay mechanics within these levels are largely {{similar to those in}} ground-based levels, with the exception of some different attack moves (such as tail attacks).

Similarly, the player cannot use Saphira in ground-based levels: they can call for her and she will swoop past, but it is not possible to use this feature to ride Saphira. There is a multiplayer co-op mode which allows <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> play through the main storyline.
