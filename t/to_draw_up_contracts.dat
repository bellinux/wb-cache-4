40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Many {{rural areas}} in Africa still lack {{adequate}} electricity supply. This {{has been identified}} as a major obstacle to development in many African nations. The high costs associated with providing electricity through national grid systems prevent many governments from delivering electricity to remote rural areas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to define a strategic architecture and business model that can be used to provide solar energy to Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) in Africa. The desired outcome is a sustainable business model for solar energy provision that can be implemented in the African context. This study uses the strategic architecture framework developed by Ungerer, Pretorius and Herholdt (2011) to achieve this. Primary data was collected through interviews with industry experts and this was supplemented with a comprehensive review of current literature. An analysis of the PV market shows that solar PV has grown significantly over the past decade and the industry is already extremely competitive. The highest competitive pressures include substitute products, high buyer bargaining because of low product differentiation, and the threat of new entrants. The industry has a clearly defined value chain starting with the manufacturing of PV panels and other systems components, but goes as far as providing financing to customers. The profit potential in the industrial and commercial segments is highest and key competitors in this segment offer similar products and services. The customer analysis showed that small businesses vary considerably in the products and services they offer and that their energy needs also differ. Services that can be offered to these customers include energy efficiency assessments, system design, pre-project services, financing, system installation and system monitoring, operation and maintenance. The organisation that will implement the strategy is a company called Solshare. The organisation identified its vision and mission, and core values and defined the domain it will participate in. The commercial and industrial segments are regarded as the most appealing segments and the core product offering is energy efficiency assessments and solar installations. This will be offered through an innovative shared-solar model that also includes system financing, system monitoring and system optimisation, and will be implemented by carefully selected partners to minimise cost. Solshareâ€™s objective is to develop a distinctive competence in financing and implementing shared-solar projects through strategic partnerships, while providing excellent customer service. It will employ is a focused low-cost strategy by providing solar energy to small businesses at the lowest cost possible, through a shared resource approach. Costs will be managed by focusing on a core set of activities and outsourcing non-core activities. The key value proposition is the development, installation and servicing of quality shared-solar solutions at the lowest cost. The cost drivers include the costs of solar system components procured from suppliers, the installation costs, salaries, marketing costs, system maintenance, and legal fees <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>contracts</b> and lease agreements. Income streams include energy assessments, fees charged for site selection and procurement, the installation of systems, and the monitoring and maintenance of installed systems. The capital mix consists of 30 % equity and 70 % debt and organisation aims to optimise resource velocity through completing new installations within a four month period and by employing a core team of professional sales and technical staff, while outsourcing non-core processes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Supply Chain {{professionals}} (SCP) {{and senior}} executives are facing new {{challenges in the}} new world of global outsourcing of knowledge-based services. These services include managing outsourced customer service, software, and R&D. Supply Professionals are abruptly asked by senior management to find vendors for a particular task <b>to</b> be outsourced, <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>contracts,</b> and transition the task and thereafter be at least partially responsible for the delivery quality, price, and many other tasks including innovation and new product development from the service provider. Our research suggests that it is really important for supply management professionals to be closely involved at the transition of the outsourced task and {{the early part of the}} provider relationship. Such early involvement in setting up the working relationship with the provider will facilitate projected cost savings and also sustain the quality of purchased services. Above all, such early involvement of supply management will enable the effective management of the supply chain intellectual property and sustain innovation generation in the upstream knowledge services supply chain. Background. As outsourcing moves from low-end services to knowledge-based services, public outcry has grown about American job losses. In the heat of this debate, questions suc...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend in}} the {{district}} heating industry is toward increased privatization and openness to competition, which bring with them other phenomena associated with civil law, such as bankruptcies. VingÃ¥ker was one of six Swedish municipalities whose district heating companies went bankrupt in 2004. The bankruptcy caused major disruptions in VingÃ¥ker, not least {{as a result of}} the unregulated legal framework that has long prevailed in the area of district heating, where there is essentially no consumer protection. A distinguishing feature of VingÃ¥ker, and one that may be assumed to apply to other smafler municipalities as well, is the fact that the municipality was the totally dominant customer in the district heating system. In its negotiations, the municipality was able to exploit this position of strength by refusing to pay the district heating pnce set by the trustee in bankruptcy while still continuing to have district heat delivered. At the same time, the case of VingÃ¥ker also shows that, in their procurement processes, municipalities need to conduct a thorough analysis of the ownership structures of the bidding companies, and determine the extent to which each company is established in the industry. Yet another lesson to be taken from this case is that changes in external factors such as fuel costs and taxes, which are difficult for local actors to influence, create a need <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> short-term <b>contracts</b> that allow for adjustments in the district heating rates.
