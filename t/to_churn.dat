5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having <b>to</b> <b>churn</b> out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used <b>to</b> <b>churn</b> butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land.

25|$|New England has a {{rich history}} in filmmaking {{dating back to}} the dawn of the motion picture era {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, {{sometimes}} dubbed Hollywood East by film critics. A theater at 547 Washington Street in Boston was the second location to debut a picture projected by the Vitascope, and shortly thereafter several novels were being adapted for the screen and set in New England, including The Scarlet Letter and The House of Seven Gables. The New England region continued <b>to</b> <b>churn</b> out films at a pace above the national average for the duration of the 20th century, including blockbuster hits such as Jaws, Good Will Hunting, and The Departed, all of which won Oscars. The New England area became known for a number of themes that recurred in films made during this era, including the development of yankee characters, smalltown life contrasted with city values, seafaring tales, family secrets, and haunted New England. These themes are rooted in centuries of New England culture and are complemented by the region's diverse natural landscape and architecture, from the Atlantic Ocean and brilliant fall foliage to church steeples and skyscrapers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} assumed that churning losses {{can be described}} by using only two physical parameters representative of the lubricant properties, i. e., density and viscosity. To verify this hypothesis, a number of transient measurements were carried out on a specific gear test rig over a range of oil temperatures. It appears that, for high temperatures and/or high rotational speeds, the drag torque can suddenly increase with an increasing Reynolds number. Extensive on-line lubricant aeration measurements were conducted showing that this particular behaviour can be related <b>to</b> <b>churning</b> losses when the fraction of air in the lubricant reaches a certain threshold. In order to quantify the influence of oil sump aeration on churning losses, a simplified original model, based on surface tension and lubricant aeration is proposed. This study shows clearly that density and viscosity are not sufficient <b>to</b> estimate <b>churning</b> losses under some specific operating conditions and emphasises the need to account for other physical properties of the lubricant...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of aggregation and disruption of fat globules in cream subjected to viscous flow were studied, and special care {{was taken to}} exclude air bubbles. In classical churning processes the incorporation of air was essential, but it was clearly shown that also {{in the absence of}} air rapid and efficient churning was possible. <b>Churning</b> was shown <b>to</b> be satisfactory at a fairly narrow range of shearing rates; higher and lower rates led <b>to</b> excessive <b>churning</b> times, or <b>to</b> abnormal butter formation and high fat content in the buttermilk. The experiments were performed in a cylindrical vessel in which a concentric solid cylinder could be rotated at different speeds. The influence of shear rate (cylinder velocity, annular clearance and cream viscosity), temperature, fat content, acidity and fat globule size were studied in relation <b>to</b> <b>churning</b> time and efficiency. Partly empirical equations were derived, describing the relations. A churning time of a few seconds and a fat content in the buttermilk below 1 % could easily be achieved...|$|R
25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines <b>to</b> <b>churn</b> and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E
25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them <b>to</b> <b>churn</b> the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E
