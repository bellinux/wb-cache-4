40|$|Poaceae species {{present a}} conserved {{distichous}} phyl-lotaxy (leaf position along the stem) and share com-mon properties {{with respect to}} leaf initiation. The goal of this work {{was to determine if}} these common traits imply common genes. Therefore, homologues of the maize <b>TERMINAL</b> <b>EAR</b> 1 gene in Poaceae were studied. This gene encodes an RNA-binding motif (RRM) pro-tein, that is suggested to regulate leaf initiation. Using degenerate primers, one unique tel (<b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1 -like) gene from seven Poaceae members, covering almost all the phylogenetic tree of the family, was identified by PCR. These genes present a very high degree of similarity, a much conserved exon–intron structure, and the three RRMs and TEL characteristic motifs. The evolution of tel sequences in Poaceae strongly correlates with the known phylogenetic tree of this family. RT-PCR gene expression analyses show con-served tel expression in the shoot apex in all species, suggesting functional orthology between these genes. In addition, in situ hybridization experiments with spe-cific antisense probes show tel transcript accumula-tion in all differentiating cells of the leaf, from the recruitment of leaf founder cells to leaf margins cells. Tel expression is not restricted to initiating leaves as it is also found in pro-vascular tissues, root meristems, and immature inflorescences. Therefore, these results suggest that TEL is not only associated with leaf initiation but more generally with cell differentiation i...|$|E
40|$|In higher plants, leaves {{initiate}} {{in constant}} {{spatial and temporal}} patterns. Although the pattern of leaf initiation {{is a key element}} of plant shoot architecture, little is known about how the time interval between initiation events, termed plastochron, is regulated. Here, we present a detailed analysis of plastochron 2 (pla 2), a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron and precocious maturation of leaves during the vegetative phase and ectopic shoot formation during the reproductive phase. The corresponding PLA 2 gene is revealed to be an orthologue of <b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1, a maize (Zea mays) gene that encodes a MEI 2 -like RNA binding protein. PLA 2 is expressed predominantly in young leaf primordia. We show that PLA 2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA 1, which encodes a member of the P 450 family. Based on these analyses, we propose a model in which plastochron is determined by signals from immature leaves that act non-cell-autonomously in the shoot apical meristem to inhibit the initiation of new leaves...|$|E
40|$|<b>TERMINAL</b> <b>EAR</b> 1 -like (TEL) genes encode {{putative}} RNA-binding proteins {{only found}} in land plants. Previous studies {{suggested that they}} may regulate tissue and organ initiation in Poaceae. Two TEL genes were identified in both Populus trichocarpa and the hybrid aspen Populus tremula × P. alba, named, respectively, PoptrTEL 1 - 2 and PtaTEL 1 - 2. The analysis of the organisation around the PoptrTEL genes in the P. trichocarpa genome and the estimation of the synonymous substitution rate for PtaTEL 1 - 2 genes indicate that the paralogous link between these two Populus TEL genes probably results from the Salicoid large-scale gene-duplication event. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed their orthology link with the other TEL genes. The expression pattern of both PtaTEL genes appeared to be restricted to the mother cells of the plant body: leaf founder cells, leaf primordia, axillary buds and root differentiating tissues, {{as well as to}} mother cells of vascular tissues. Most interestingly, PtaTEL 1 - 2 transcripts were found in differentiating cells of secondary xylem and phloem, but probably not in the cambium itself. Taken together, these results indicate specific expression of the TEL genes in differentiating cells controlling tissue and organ development in Populus (and other Angiosperm species) ...|$|E

Ethylketocyclazocine, dynorphin (1 - 13) and leucine enkephalin produced partial inhibition, their apparent intrinsic activities (alpha) being 0. 57, 0. 75 and 0. 66, respectively. Morphine and normorphine, which are agonists at mu-receptors, did not inhibit {{the response of}} the artery. Naloxone antagonized the actions of opioids and ethylketocyclazocine, and was more effective against methionine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin and [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5] enkephalin than against alpha-neoendorphin, ethylketocyclazocine and dynorphin (1 - 13). The pA 2 values of naloxone against so-called delta-agonists were approx. 8. 5, and against so-called kappa-agonists were approx. 7. 7. The supposed kappa-antagonist, Mr 2266, was more effective than naloxone in antagonizing the actions of alpha-neoendorphin, and the kappa-agonists dynorphin (1 - 13) and ethylketocyclazocine. The pA 2 values of Mr 2266 against kappa-agonists were 8. 5 - 9. 0, and against delta-agonists were 7. 8 or less. The opioid peptides and opioids tested did not cause dilatation of the artery previously contracted with histamine. These results suggest that the opioid peptides and ethylketocyclazocine acted on opioid receptors at adrenergic nerve <b>terminals</b> in the <b>ear</b> artery.

40|$|Nucleotide {{diversity}} in the <b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1 (te 1) gene, a regulatory locus hypothesized {{to be involved in}} the morphological evolution of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), was investigated for evidence of past selection. Nucleotide polymorphism in a 1. 4 -kb region of te 1 was analyzed for a sample of 26 sequences isolated from 12 maize lines, five populations of the maize progenitor, Z. mays ssp. parviglumis, six other Zea populations, and two Tripsacum species. Although nucleotide {{diversity in}} te 1 in maize is reduced relative to ssp. parviglumis, phylogenetic and statistical analyses of the pattern of polymorphism among these sequences provided no evidence of past selection, indicating that the region of the gene studied was probably not involved in maize evolution. The level of reduction in genetic diversity in te 1 in maize relative to its progenitor is comparable to that found in previous reports for isozymes and other neutrally evolving maize genes and is consistent with a genome-wide reduction of genetic diversity resulting from a domestication bottleneck. An estimate of the age (1. 2 - 1. 4 million yr) of the maize gene pool based on te 1 is roughly consistent with previous estimates based on other neutral genes, but may be biased by the apparently slow synonymous substitution rate at te 1...|$|E
40|$|Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and its wild progenitor, {{teosinte}} (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis) differ {{dramatically in}} inflorescence and plant architecture {{despite the fact}} that their evolutionary divergence occurred within the past 10, 000 years or less. To elucidate the genetic control of the morphological differences between maize and teosinte, my colleague and I employed quantitative trait locus mapping with molecular markers. Results indicated that most of the variation in plant and inflorescence morphology between maize and teosinte can be explained by five restricted regions of the genome. In this paper, characterization of three of these regions and their effects on plant and inflorescence development will be discussed. Each of these regions appears to contain a single major locus of large effect. One of these loci, teosinte branched 1, largely controls the difference in plant architecture. Another, teosinte glume architecture 1, controls the formation of the teosinte cupulate fruitcase that encases the kernel. A third candidate, <b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1, is hypothesized to control internode elongation within the inflorescence. In addition to their main effects, each locus appears to have pleiotropic effects on other traits. Genetic analyses also demonstrate that some of these loci exhibit epistatic interactions. The results suggest that mutations at a small number (five) of regulatory loci may have been the initial steps in the domestication of maize, supporting a model for maize evolution proposed by George Beadle in 1939...|$|E
40|$|The shoot {{represents}} the basic body plan in land plants. It {{consists of a}} repeated structure composed of stems and leaves. Whereas vascular plants generate a shoot in their diploid phase, non-vascular plants such as mosses form a shoot (called the gametophore) in their haploid generation. The evolution of regulatory mechanisms or genetic networks used {{in the development of}} these two kinds of shoots is unclear. <b>TERMINAL</b> <b>EAR</b> 1 -like genes have been involved in diploid shoot development in vascular plants. Here, we show that disruption of PpTEL 1 from the moss Physcomitrella patens, causes reduced protonema growth and gametophore initiation, as well as defects in gametophore development. Leafy shoots formed on Delta TEL 1 mutants exhibit shorter stems with more leaves per shoot, suggesting an accelerated leaf initiation (shortened plastochron), a phenotype shared with the Poaceae vascular plants TE 1 and PLA 2 /LHD 2 mutants. Moreover, the positive correlation between plastochron length and leaf size observed in DTEL 1 mutants suggests a conserved compensatory mechanism correlating leaf growth and leaf initiation rate that would minimize overall changes in plant biomass. The RNA-binding protein encoded by PpTEL 1 contains two N-terminus RNA-recognition motifs, and a third C-terminus non-canonical RRM, specific to TEL proteins. Removal of the PpTEL 1 C-terminus (including this third RRM) or only 16 - 18 amino acids within it seriously impairs PpTEL 1 function, suggesting a critical role for this third RRM. These results show a conserved function of the RNA-binding PpTEL 1 protein in the regulation of shoot development, from early ancestors to vascular plants, that depends on the third TEL-specific RRM...|$|E
40|$|In the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) the {{position}} at which leaf primordia arise on the periphery, and their subsequent differentiation, {{have been shown}} to be (at least in part) to be directed by genetic programs of development. A candidate gene associated with this regulation is <b>TERMINAL</b> <b>EAR</b> 1 (TE 1) a maize gene identified by the irregular phyllotaxy of its mutant lines. Unlike most other genes associated with meristem function, TE 1 is a novel RNA binding gene of the RRM type. It has been shown to have orthologues in a variety of plants including Arabidopsis thaliana as well as unicellular eukaryotes including MEI 2, a gene whose product is associated with the regulation of meiosis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In order to more fully understand TE 1 's role, a functional characterisation of two of the so-called Mei 2 -like genes was undertaken in the model plant A. thaliana. These genes are called Terminal Ear-Like 1 and 2 (TEL 1 and TEL 2). Constitutive overexpression of the cDNA of TEL 2 using the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35 S promoter (CaMV 35 S) revealed a phenotype involving an apparently prolonged vegetative phase. However this was only observed in a limited number of lines of the total screened, and the next generation did not reiterate this phenotype. These difficulties were overcome using the LhGpOP construct system for ectopic misexpression in specific domains as well as inducible ubiquitous expression. Ectopic expression of either TEL cDNA is shown to lead to a pleiotrophic spectrum of phenotypes, which in general, were associated with reduced determinant development outside the apical meristems and as well as a delayed overall developmental progression. This provided some evidence that the normal function of TEL genes within the apical meristems is the repression of differentiation associated with the regulation of plant growth and architecture...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the genes}} {{affecting}} maize ear inflorescence may lead to better grain yield modeling. Maize ear fasciation, defined as abnormal flattened ears with high kernel row number, is a quantitative trait widely present in Portuguese maize landraces. Using a segregating population derived from an ear fasciation contrasting cross (consisting of 149 F 2 : 3 families) we established a two location field trial using a complete randomized block design. Correlations and heritabilities for several ear fasciation-related traits and yield were determined. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) involved in the inheritance of those traits were identified and candidate genes for these QTL proposed. Ear fasciation broad-sense heritability was 0. 73. Highly significant correlations were found between ear fasciation and some ear and cob diameters and row number traits. For the 23 yield and ear fasciation-related traits, 65 QTL were identified, out of which 11 were detected in both environments, while for the three principal components, five to six QTL were detected per environment. Detected QTL were distributed across 17 genomic regions and explained individually, 8. 7 % to 22. 4 % of the individual traits or principal components phenotypic variance. Several candidate genes for these QTL regions were proposed, such as bearded-ear 1, branched silkless 1, compact plant 1, ramosa 2, ramosa 3, tasselseed 4 and <b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1. However, many QTL mapped to regions without known candidate genes, indicating potential chromosomal regions not yet targeted for maize ear traits selection. Portuguese maize germplasm represents a valuable source of genes or allelic variants for yield improvement and elucidation of the genetic basis of ear fasciation traits. Future studies should focus on fine mapping of the identified genomic regions {{with the aim of}} map-based cloning...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{and genetic}} methods {{were used to}} analyse how a novel class of genes, plant Mei 2 -like genes may be {{involved}} in the regulation of morphogenesis in plants. The study specifically aimed to 1) further characterise maize te 1 (the first plant Mei 2 -like gene to be genetically analysed) and understand the morphological basis of the te 1 mutant phenotype and 2) analyse the function of Arabidopsis <b>Terminal</b> <b>Ear</b> Like (TEL) genes using expression analyses and reverse genetics strategy. te 1 maize mutants are initially characterised by abnormal phytomer formation and development. A more detailed morphological analysis shows that mutant plants 1) have smaller vegetative shoot apices than the wild type, 2) initiate leaves at a higher, more distal position on the apical dome and 3) have higher plastochron ratio. Molecular analyses of kn 1 expression pattern, a marker of leaf founder identity, show that dowregulation of kn 1 transcripts occur higher up the dome. Clonal analyses show that fewer number of leaf founder cells are recruited to form the leaf. TEL 1 and TEL 2 are expressed in distinct overlapping domains in the undifferentiated region of the shoot apical meristems during the embryo, vegetative and reproductive stages of Arabidopsis development suggesting involvement of these genes in regulating meristem development and subsequent maintenance. The distinct expression of TEL 1 in both the embryonic SAM and RAM raises the possibility of a unifying regulatory mechanism {{in the formation of the}} root and the shoot. The absence of TEL single knockout phenotypes supports the idea of functional redundancy. When the TEL genes were both knocked out, double mutant phenotypes show apical-basal pattern defects, ectopic production of numerous secondary shoots, production of numerous leaves and basic embryonic pattern defects such as deletions of apical and/or basal region of the seedling. Results of this study support the hypothesis that plant Mei 2 -like genes are important in regulating morphogenesis in plants and that they are required in the early patterning of the basic plant body...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of the maize <b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1 (te 1) gene have {{shortened}} internodes, abnormal phyllotaxy, leaf pattern {{defects and}} partial feminisation of tassels. The te 1 gene encodes an RNA recognition motif (RRM) protein, and {{is expressed in}} the vegetative shoot apex in semicircular rings that laterally oppose the positions of leaf primordia (Veit 1998). This project aimed to further characterise the molecular biology and function of the te 1 gene. Molecular genetic studies aimed to further characterise the genes structure and expression. Genomic clones were sequenced revealing the intron exon structure. 5 ' RACE was used to predict a 5 ' transcription start site. Competitive RT-PCR showed that te 1 transcripts were highest in vegetative shoot meristems and embryos, lower in ears, roots and tassels, and undetectable in leaves. Two te 1 mutant alleles were cloned and the junctions sequenced, a further five alleles were characterised incompletely. The TE 1 peptide belongs to a subclass of RRM proteins which includes the Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein MEI 2. More than 30 putative plant Mei 2 -like genes were identified in Genbank, no examples {{have been found in}} metazoans. Seven Mei 2 -like genes were predicted from the completed Arabidopsis genome. Exon structure and amino acid sequence supported three groupings of Mei 2 -like genes. Structural predictions of Mei 2 -like proteins indicate that the third RRM contained some novel structural features not present in canonical RRM proteins. Attempts to study the function of the TE 1 protein in vitro were limited by the inability of both E. coli and Pichia pastoris expression systems to express the full length protein, probably due to codon bias. Antibodies produced to a C-terminal portion of the protein did not specifically detect the TE 1 protein in plant extracts without incurring non-specific activity. The te 1 cDNA was ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis from a copper-inducible promoter both with and without the SV 40 nuclear localisation signal (NLS). Although both te 1 and NLS:te 1 transgenes were detected in transformants no phenotypes consistently correlated with transgene expression...|$|E
40|$|In maize, a loss-of-function {{mutation}} in a MEI 2 -like gene, <b>terminal</b> <b>ear</b> 1 (te 1), leads to morphological defects {{able to be}} traced back to the shoot apical meristem. One MEI 2 -like gene has been identified in maize, while six have been identified in rice and nine in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this thesis, a programme of reverse genetic analysis has been designed to investigate if Arabidopsis genes most closely aligned in parsimony trees with TE 1, TERMINAL EAR-LIKE 1 (TEL 1), TERMINAL EAR-LIKE 2 (TEL 2), perform the same function as TE 1. The expression pattern of TEL 1 and TEL 2 genes is restricted to the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) and the Root Apical Meristem (RAM) suggesting these genes are important in meristem maintenance or function. Results of the molecular genetic analysis of TEL genes in Arabidopsis support models in which these genes help maintain cells in a pluripotent state. For the first part of the thesis, analysis of lines carrying single knockouts of TEL 1 and TEL 2 and double knockout lines reveals a slightly accelerated rate of organogenesis, consistent with these genes normally acting to inhibit terminal differentiation pathways. Plants grown on medium containing gibberellic acid and sucrose, at higher than normal concentrations, present a further accelerated rate of organogenesis. As the second part of the thesis, in situ and promoter/reporter GUS fusion analyses indicate TEL 1 is preferentially expressed in both the root and shoot apical meristems. Deletion analysis using GFP reporter constructs show that 5 ' sequences are sufficient to drive quiescent centre (QC) expression in the root while additional sequences are required for central zone (CZ) expression in the SAM. Physiological studies indicate expression of TEL 1 in the root is sensitive to the hormones, auxin, gibberellic acid and zeatin, when added at physiological concentrations. To confirm the auxin effect, GFP expression is no longer visible after 12 hours of exposure to auxin transport inhibitors in plants containing GFP under the control of the TEL 1 promoter, suggesting, in common with other QC markers, that TEL expression is sensitive to auxin levels. Analysis of mutant plants with altered root patterning suggests QC specific expression of TEL 1 requires early acting genes, such as PLETHORA 1 and 2, but does not depend on later acting genes such as SCARECROW or SHORTROOT...|$|E
