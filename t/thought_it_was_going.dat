He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

Could she row the two {{miles to the}} Big Dipper in the darkness and the snow? If she could, dare she leave Nellie all alone in the house? Oh, she couldn't! Somebody at the Harbour Head would surely notice that the Big Dipper light was unlighted and would go over to investigate the cause. But suppose they shouldn't? If the snow came thicker they might never notice {{the absence of the}} light. And suppose there was a ship away out there, as there nearly always was, with the dangerous rocks and shoals of the outer harbour to pass, with precious lives on board and no guiding beacon on the Big Dipper.|$|R

500|$|This {{species is}} often listed in field guides as inedible, or not {{recommended}} for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is {{not as bad as}} I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be. It's not good, mind you, but {{it would be possible to}} eat it with a forced smile if your Aunt Wanda served it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, when Jean {{announced}} {{the title of}} the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour, several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off. Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying [...] "I was like, 'What? [...] "In the dumps" [...] doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was so obvious. I would be nuts to kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character". [...] He said of the episode, [...] "It turned out bigger than we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be. It's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of Edmondson's Holby City co-stars have {{described}} feeling {{intimidated by the}} prospect of working alongside him for the first time, stemming from his already well established fame. Rakie Ayola explained: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be difficult at the beginning because he wasn't speaking to me. But he was initially just a little shy and sussing things out. He's a lot quieter than you would expect but then suddenly he'll say something that has everybody doubled up in laughter. You won't find anyone who doesn't like him." [...] Edmondson himself has added that he gets along well with the cast, although finds that the distance of Elstree Studios from most of their London homes makes them [...] "weirdly unsociable".|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did {{a lot better than}} I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia, which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to look like my body turning to stone. Instead I looked like a big old hot fudge sundae, and my head was the cherry on top." ...|$|E
500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce Billy goat. For a moment I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be incredibly awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997). A goat puzzle was featured in , in the beginning and ending of 2014 second and final episode of the title, as part of the achieved $800,000 Kickstarter [...] "stretch goal".|$|E

500|$|As the Bosnian War {{ended in}} 1995 and the Siege of Sarajevo in 1996, the {{stability}} of the region began to improve. Realizing this, U2 began to plan a concert for Sarajevo that would take place on their 1997 PopMart Tour. Although they were the first major musical artist to perform in the city following the war, China Drum had played a concert in July 1996. Music journalist Andrew Mueller described China Drum's experience in a single van as a [...] "logistical and administrative nightmare". Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian Ambassador to the United Nations, helped U2 make arrangements, playing an informal role as promoter and organizer. McGuinness said, [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be quite difficult. But it's been quite straightforward. People have just wanted to help. We've blagged a lot of equipment, forklifts and so on, from the military, and the local crew have been incredibly supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later {{than the rest of the}} cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|The casting of American {{actor and}} comedian Robin Williams as the Genie {{inspired}} {{the studio to}} recruit similarly talented voice actors capable of matching his pace. The filmmakers had originally envisioned Jasmine's voice as {{similar to that of}} actress Lauren Bacall. Jasmine's speaking voice is provided by American actress Linda Larkin. The role was only one of several auditions Larkin had scheduled during the same week in which she auditioned for Aladdin, and she originally underestimated the scope of the project, joking, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be something like Duck Tales (sic)". Initially presented with only a few pages of the screenplay, Larkin found that she was particularly drawn to Jasmine's [...] "spirit of activism", in addition {{to the ways in which}} character was both similar to and different from previous Disney heroines. Princesses Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora had been childhood favorites of the actress. Larkin's first audition was held in a Burbank, California recording studio, in which she performed solely for the film's casting director. The side used for Larkin's first audition was the scene in which Jasmine meets Aladdin in the marketplace – their first encounter. Jasmine's line [...] "It's all so magical" [...] helped convince Larkin that she was [...] "meant" [...] to voice the character. Although Larkin's voice was significantly different from what the filmmakers had originally envisioned for the character, her interpretation gradually changed their minds.|$|E
5000|$|Pain catastrophizing is the {{tendency}} to describe a pain experience in more exaggerated terms than the average person, to ruminate on it more (e.g., [...] "I kept thinking 'this is terrible'"), and/or to feel more helpless about the experience ("I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never <b>going</b> to get better"). People who report {{a large number of}} such thoughts during a pain experience are more likely to rate the pain as more intense than those who report fewer such thoughts.|$|R

500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
500|$|From 2006 to 2007, Sheen starred as the {{television}} broadcaster David Frost in Frost/Nixon {{at both the}} Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The play, written by Peter Morgan, directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella, was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and [...] "never <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> anywhere". The Guardian said the actor [...] "exactly captures Frost's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance". [...] "He's got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze," [...] said the Financial Times, [...] "but, more than that, Sheen—as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today—shows us the hunger of Frost's ambition [...]. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill." [...] Sheen {{was nominated for a}} Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film Music Within as a political activist with cerebral palsy. He spoke of having a [...] "responsibility" [...] to accurately portray the condition. Variety said his performance was [...] "remarkable.. utterly convincing", USA Today found him [...] "outstanding" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he was [...] "reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot, bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role". Also that year, Sheen starred in the short film Airlock, or How To Say Goodbye in Space with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors' branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.|$|E

2500|$|Heidfeld {{picked up}} his first podium since the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix – another race won by Hamilton – and was {{relieved}} to have kept Rosberg behind him, believing that his fellow German was fuelled longer than he actually was. [...] "After the start I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a very good race because I knew that Nico was quite long. Actually he came in earlier than expected on the same lap as myself. What we lost at the start we regained on the pit-stop, so our pit-stop crew, just did a fantastic job to just get me out ahead of Nico.

2500|$|Dupas {{was again}} {{released}} from prison in February 1985. Approximately one month later, he raped a 21-year-old woman on a beach at Blairgowrie. After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm sorry for what happened.

2500|$|Similar to the band's third studio album, Amputechture, {{the album}} {{does not contain}} a single unifying narrative. Vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala notes that the album is [...] "not really" [...] a concept album: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be but never really got around to writing about {{anything}} in particular. Just a lot of instant song composing and regular themes that I wouldn't even want to elaborate on [...] kidnappings, vanishings, 'what if' scenarios {{about how to get}} Republicans out of the White House if they'd got in." ...|$|E
2500|$|At age 14, Wainwright {{was sexually}} {{assaulted}} in London's Hyde Park after {{picking up a}} man at a bar.

I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a romantic walk in the park, but he raped me and robbed me afterwards and tried to strangle me". Wainwright states that he survived only by pretending to be an epileptic and faking a seizure. He has been reported to have stated that he remained celibate for five or seven years after the incident, and eventually became promiscuous.|$|E
