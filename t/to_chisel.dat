25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E
500|$|The birds {{lived in}} forests at both montane and lowland {{elevations}} – they {{are thought to}} have moved seasonally, living at higher elevation in summer and descending to lower elevation in winter. Huia were omnivorous and ate adult insects, grubs and spiders, as well as the fruits of a small number of native plants. Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways: the male used his bill <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> away at rotting wood, while the female's longer, more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas. Even though the huia is frequently mentioned in biology and ornithology textbooks because of this striking dimorphism, not much is known about its biology; it was little studied before it was driven to extinction.|$|E

500|$|The gravestone {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} vandalized by those aggrieved that [...] "Hughes" [...] is {{written on the}} stone; they have attempted <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> it off, leaving only the name [...] "Sylvia Plath." [...] When Hughes' mistress Assia Wevill killed herself and their four-year-old daughter Shura in 1969, this practice intensified. After each defacement, Hughes had the damaged stone removed, sometimes leaving the site unmarked during repair. Outraged mourners accused Hughes in the media of dishonoring her name by removing the stone. Wevill's death led to claims that Hughes had been abusive to both Plath and Wevill. Radical feminist poet Robin Morgan published the poem [...] "Arraignment", in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. Other feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath's name. Plath's poem [...] "The Jailor", in which the speaker condemns her husband's brutality, {{was included in the}} 1970 anthology [...]|$|E
500|$|Insects and spiders {{were taken}} from {{decaying}} wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups. The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its adze-like bill <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood, while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by [...] "gaping" [...] motions. There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature {{of the head and}} neck between males and females. Huia had very well developed depressor jaw muscles, and an occipital crest that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force. Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Mechanical {{harvesting}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} sugarcane production units, and it has often resulted in reduced structural quality of the soil due to soil compaction caused by machine traffic. Thus, sugarcane ratoon crops have often been <b>chiseled</b> <b>to</b> overcome such a problem. The aim {{of the current study}} is to assess some physical properties of a Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico (Rhodic Hapludox) that was chiseled after the third harvest in a sugarcane ratoon crop. The study was conducted in a commercial crop area throughout the 2011 / 2012 crop year. A randomized block experimental design was used, with five replications. The treatments consisted of five chiseling operations in sugarcane ratoon crops, namely: T 1 - single-shank ripper with <b>chiseling</b> <b>to</b> a depth of 0. 15 m; T 2 - single-shank ripper with <b>chiseling</b> <b>to</b> a depth of 0. 30 m; T 3 - two-bar ripper with <b>chiseling</b> <b>to</b> a depth of 0. 15 m, T 4 - two-bar ripper with <b>chiseling</b> <b>to</b> a depth of 0. 30 m; and T 5 - control group, with no chiseling. Overall, soil chiseling is effective for improving the physical quality of the soil to a depth of 0. 15 m, regardless of the equipment and the depth. Two-bar-ripper-based soil <b>chiseling</b> <b>to</b> a depth of 0. 30 m provides increased sugarcane yield...|$|R

2500|$|Construction on the Maine Mast Memorial {{began in}} late November 1913. [...] Wyeth's design {{featured}} {{as a base}} a mausoleum which vaguely looked like a battleship gun turret. The mast of the Maine pierced {{the top of this}} structure, and was set into the floor below. The design called for an exterior made of tan granite, and an interior lined with white marble. The names of those who died aboard the Maine were to be inscribed on the exterior of the mausoleum. The granite for the structure came from Troy, New Hampshire, and the marble from Danby, Vermont. Eight months were originally allotted for construction, largely due to the need <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> the 8,000 letters into the exterior. The Washington, D.C., firm of Norcross Bros. won the $44,637 contract to construct the memorial. This created some controversy, as Norcross was not the lowest bidder. However, Quartermaster General Sharpe recommended Norcross because the company could obtain the stone best suited for the memorial. A month's delay occurred as the contract was contested.|$|E

In such a case we are always deferring the reality of life till a future moment, and, by and by, we have deferred it till there are no future moments; or, if we do go back, we find that life has shifted whatever of reality it had to the country where we deemed ourselves only living temporarily; and so between two stools we come to the ground, and make ourselves a part of one or the other country only by laying our bones in its soil.

6000|$|It is {{an ancient}} truism that water must find its level. Owing to this law, much water accumulates in the shaft, obliging the miner to erect an engine-house and provide a {{powerful}} pumping-engine with all its gear, at immense cost, to keep the works dry as he proceeds. He then goes to the shore, and there, {{in the face of}} the perpendicular cliff, a little above the sea-level, he cuts a horizontal tunnel about six feet high by three broad, and continues <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> and blast away the solid rock until he [...] "drives" [...] his tunnel a quarter of a mile inland, which he will do at a rate varying from two to six feet per week, according to the hardness of the rock, until he reaches the shaft and thus provides an easy and inexpensive passage for the water without pumping. This tunnel or level he calls the [...] "Adit level." [...] But his pumping-engine is by no means rendered useless, for it has much to do in hauling ore to the surface, etcetera. In process of time, the miner works away all the lode down to the sea-level, and must sink the shaft deeper--perhaps ten or twenty fathoms--where new levels are driven horizontally [...] "on the lode," [...] and water accumulates which must be pumped up to the Adit level, whence it escapes to the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... § 6. But {{more than}} this: {{the fact is}} that in multitudes of instances, instead of gaining greater {{fineness}} of finish by our work, we are only destroying the fine finish of nature, and substituting coarseness and imperfection. For instance, when a rock of any kind has lain for some time exposed to the weather, Nature finishes it in her own way; first, she takes wonderful pains about its forms, sculpturing it into exquisite variety of dint and dimple, and rounding or hollowing it into contours, which for fineness no human hand can follow; then she colors it; and every one of her touches of color, instead of being a powder mixed with oil, is a minute forest of living trees, glorious in strength and beauty, and concealing wonders of structure, which in all probability are mysteries even to the eyes of angels. Man comes and digs up this finished and marvellous piece of work, which in his ignorance he calls a [...] "rough stone." [...] He proceeds to finish it in his fashion, that is, to split it in two, rend it into ragged blocks, and, finally, <b>to</b> <b>chisel</b> its surface into a large number of lumps and knobs, all equally shapeless, colorless, deathful, and frightful.[39] And the block, thus disfigured, he calls [...] "finished," [...] and proceeds to build therewith, and thinks himself great, forsooth, and an intelligent animal. Whereas, all that he has really done is, to destroy with utter ravage a piece of divine art, which, under the laws appointed by the Deity to regulate his work in this world, it must take good twenty years to produce the like of again. This he has destroyed, and has himself given in its place a piece of work which needs no more intelligence to do than a pholas has, or a worm, or the spirit which throughout the world has authority over rending, rottenness, and decay. I do not say that stone must not be cut; it needs to be cut for certain uses; only I say that the cutting it is not [...] "finishing," [...] but unfinishing it; and that so far as the mere fact of chiselling goes, the stone is ruined by the human touch. It is with it as with the stones of the Jewish altar: [...] "If thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it." [...] In like manner a tree is a finished thing. But a plank, though ever so polished, is not. We need stones and planks, as we need food; but we no more bestow an additional admirableness upon stone in hewing it, or upon a tree in sawing it, than upon an animal in killing it.|$|E
