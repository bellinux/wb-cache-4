5|$|In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell {{and went}} for tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|Hess's flight, {{but not his}} {{destination}} or fate, {{was first}} announced by Munich Radio in Germany {{on the evening of}} 12 May.

On 14 May Ilse Hess finally learned that her husband had survived the trip when news of his fate was broadcast on German radio.|$|E

5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday {{in the south of}} France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing. Doyle, returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of Australia, received <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In retirement, the Goodmans {{enjoyed a}} rich family life, visiting often with son Theodore ("Ted") {{and his wife}} Carol, and {{daughter}} Lydia Ann ("Ann") and son-in-law Bob. To his unabashed delight, Urner and Louise Goodman had nine grandchildren. Their son George was killed in action in France during World War II, however. Upon hearing <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> December 1944, Goodman was deeply grieved, and Louise, his wife of 60 years, {{said it was the}} only time she ever saw him cry.|$|E
5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E

5|$|Several {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted {{in anticipation of}} the storm. Upon the development of Ingrid into a {{tropical cyclone}} at 2100UTC on September12, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Coatzacoalcos to Nautla, Veracruz. At 1500UTC on September13, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, with a tropical storm watch northward to La Pesca, Tamaulipas. Later, a hurricane warning was issued between Cabo Rojo to La Pesca, with a tropical storm watch to Bahia Algodones, Tamaulipas. Pemex, the oil company operated by the Mexican government, evacuated workers from three platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to the storm. In Tamaulipas, classes were canceled in 27municipalities, and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout Veracruz. The threat of the storm caused events for Mexican Independence Day to be canceled. After a restriction on <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> 2010 due to the local drug war, members of a citizen alert system in Tamaulipas used Twitter to notify about flooding, missing people, and the need for assistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{conscription}} ran {{contrary to}} British political tradition, but the sheer {{scale of the}} Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916. The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers broadcast <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> special editions. While some settlers supported {{the extension of the}} same system to white Southern Rhodesians, it was also opposed in many quarters. The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might jeopardise its mining operations, crucial to the colonial economy, while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons. Some, mindful of John Chilembwe's anticolonial uprising in Nyasaland in early 1915, felt that it was necessary to keep a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the Mashona and Matabele rebellions of the 1890s.|$|E
