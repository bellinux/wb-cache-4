500|$|During {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a {{scientific}} observer in The Great Artiste, piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the Enola Gay as the instrumentation aircraft. [...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{get caught in the}} blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it." [...] He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.|$|E
500|$|Protests {{were also}} raised to another scene. When Aladdin is {{attacked}} by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony, Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as [...] "Good teenagers, take off your clothes," [...] which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity. However, according to the commentary track on the 2004 DVD, while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger ad-libbed during the scene, they claimed [...] "we did not record <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> record that," [...] and said the line was [...] "Good tiger, take off and go..." [...] and the word [...] "tiger" [...] is overlapped by Rajah's snarl. [...] After the word tiger, a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack. [...] Because of the controversy, Disney removed the line on the DVD release.|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{publicly}} {{skeptical about}} the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he {{voted in favor of}} the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved them and said, [...] "Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable." [...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 {{at the end of the}} year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] McCain said, [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E

Similarly, Reigbert's design consisted of contorted, angular lines and foreshortened perspectives (similar to those used in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1920).

2500|$|On 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a {{reception}} by de Gaulle {{and the two}} together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day. Harold Nicolson stated that Anthony Eden told him that [...] "not for one moment did Winston stop crying, {{and that he could}} have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris." [...] He said [...] "they yelled for Churchill in a way that he has never heard any crowd yell before.

2500|$|... whereas Anthony King's definition, {{following}} the more usual practice among Roman pottery specialists, {{makes no mention}} of decoration, but states that terra sigillata is 'alternatively known as samian ware'. [...] However, 'samian ware' is normally used only to refer to the sub-class of terra sigillata made in ancient Gaul. In European languages other than English, terra sigillata, or a translation (e.g. terre sigillée), is always used for both Italian and Gaulish products. [...] Nomenclature has to be established at an early stage of research into a subject, and antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries often used terms <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> choose today, but as long as their meaning is clear and well-established, this does not matter, and detailed study {{of the history of the}} terminology is really a side-issue that is of academic interest only. [...] Scholars writing in English now often use [...] "red gloss wares" [...] or [...] "red slip wares", both to avoid these issues of definition, [...] and also because many other wares of the Roman period share aspects of technique with the traditional sigillata fabrics.|$|E

The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E

2500|$|Reaction {{against the}} bill also spawned the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, which was {{launched}} in February 1937 by three leading opponents of the New Deal. Frank E. Gannett, a newspaper magnate, provided both money and publicity. Two other founders, Amos Pinchot, a prominent lawyer from New York, and Edward Rumely had both been Roosevelt supporters who had soured on the President's agenda. Rumely directed an effective and intensive mailing campaign to drum up public opposition to the measure. Among the original members of the Committee were James Truslow Adams, Charles Coburn, John Haynes Holmes, Dorothy Thompson, Samuel S. McClure, Mary Dimmick Harrison, and Frank A. Vanderlip. The Committee's membership reflected the bipartisan opposition to the bill, especially among better educated and wealthier constituencies. As Gannett explained, [...] "we were careful not to include anyone who had been prominent in party politics, particularly in the Republican camp. We preferred to have the Committee made up of liberals and Democrats, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be charged with having partisan motives." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... My {{late father}} was a seaman with the Wexford Steamship Company. He served the nation, like so many young men, through {{dangerous}} times in the war years. In every sense {{he and his colleagues}} put {{their lives on the line}} day after day, in ships which today would not be licensed to go on the high seas, to bring supplies to this nation. Many of his colleagues and friends and many people from Wexford and around the coast paid the ultimate price in serving this nation by losing their lives. The ships were so rickety, old and derelict <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> go to sea in them today. Yet, these brave, perhaps foolhardy, men crossed the Atlantic, went to the Mediterranean and North African coast and kept Ireland supplied with vital provisions. My father's ship, the Kerlogue, was involved in one of the great rescues of the war. One of the proudest possessions I have is a decoration awarded to him and other members of the crew for rescuing German sailors in the Bay of Biscay in December 1943, when they hauled hundreds of young men from the water .....

Maalin was among the 10,000 volunteers who participated in the effort to eradicate poliomyelitis from Somalia, which succeeded in 2008. He explained his motivation for volunteering: [...] "Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be the last place with polio too." [...] Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilisation, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities. The Boston Globe described him as one of the [...] "most valuable" [...] local coordinators for WHO. He encouraged people to be vaccinated by sharing his experiences with smallpox: [...] "Now when I meet parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine, I tell them my story. I tell them how important these vaccines are. I tell them not to do something foolish like me." [...] He continued to work as a regional coordinator for the vaccination drive, and was hailed as one of the [...] "true heroes" [...] of the campaign.|$|E

We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes. At four in the morning Avshalom began singing [...] "Hatikva," [...] and we joined in loudly, pressing against the bars. At once armed police came up to the visitors' fence near our cell. At 4:03 Avshalom was hanged. At 4:25 we were shaken by the powerful singing of Meir. Hardly able to breathe, we nevertheless joined in. He was hanged at 4:28. At five o'clock the voice of Yaakov, this time alone, penetrated our cell, singing [...] "Hatikva." [...] Again we joined in. Two minutes later he was hanged.... At dawn we informed the prison officers through an Arab warder <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be responsible for the life of any Englishman who dared enter the jail yard.
