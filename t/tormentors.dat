5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their <b>tormentors.</b> Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E
5|$|The playable protagonist {{character}} is Crash Bandicoot, a bandicoot {{who has been}} mutated by an invention called the Evolvo-Ray. The main antagonist is Doctor Neo Cortex, a mad scientist who was often ridiculed by the scientific community for his outlandish theories and is now motivated to prove his <b>tormentors</b> wrong by creating a mutated army of animals to conquer the world. Cortex's henchman is Doctor Nitrus Brio, the insecure creator of the Evolvo-Ray. Crash's love interest is Tawna, a female bandicoot about to undergo experimentation by the doctors. Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit {{by the name of}} Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special invincibility powers.|$|E
5|$|The plot sees Akemi Nakajima, {{a clever}} and bullied {{high school student}} who is the reincarnation of the deity Izanagi, develop a {{computer}} program which summons demons from Makai, the realm of demons. Initially using his program to gain revenge on his <b>tormentors,</b> the program goes {{out of control and}} he unleashes a hoard of demons. The demons are commanded by Lucifer, who resurrects the demonic gods Loki and Set following their defeat by Nakajima and Yumiko. With help from his friend Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student that became interested in Nakajima and is the reincarnation of the goddess Izanami, Nakajima takes her into Makai to help combat the demons. The pair travel into a vast subterranean labyrinth, where they defeat Lucifer's generals—including Loki and Set—before fighting Lucifer himself and defeating him, closing the entrance to Makai.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{situational}} (<b>tormentor</b> legitimacy and <b>tormentor</b> justification) and two personality (victim's {{belief in the}} just world and victim's Machiavellianism) factors on several reactions of a victim to his <b>tormentor</b> were explored. Greater conformity by victims to their <b>tormentor's</b> opinions occurred when the victims believed strongly in the just world and when the <b>tormentor</b> was well justified for his behavior; there was a greater conformity towards the <b>tormentor</b> in these conditions than towards a neutral nontormentor. The <b>tormentor</b> received less positive evaluations from the victim when he acquired his role illegitimately or when the victim was Machiavellian; when the <b>tormentor</b> acquired the role legitimately, he was liked {{no less than the}} nontormentor. The experimental variables did not affect behavioral imitation of the <b>tormentor</b> or the interpersonal distance maintained by the victim. The results failed to conform to any simple identification process. Several explanations for these results are explored and directions for additional research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|During an {{ice skating}} field trip at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow {{students}} discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally {{stands up to}} his <b>tormentors</b> and strikes {{the leader of the}} bullies, Conny, {{on the side of the}} head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond, and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.|$|E
5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main <b>tormentors</b> are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen <b>tormentors</b> follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tormentor</b> is a {{black metal}} band formed in 1986 in Budapest, Hungary. They {{recorded}} their first album, Anno Domini, in 1988, but were unable to release it {{until the end of}} communism. The album reached Norway through the tape-trading community. Following the suicide of Per Ohlin, Mayhem invited Attila Csihar from <b>Tormentor</b> to join the band; he was to perform the vocals on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. <b>Tormentor</b> split up in 1991. After a long break they reformed and released the more experimental Recipe Ferrum through Avantgarde Music in 2001.|$|R

25|$|Other hostile animals : In {{the early}} books, the Dog's main <b>tormentors</b> were the turkey, goat and pigs (Boris and Dolores).

They were also violently attacked with canes by Chinese seeking revenge on their former <b>tormentors.</b> The abusers were harshly pushed back by the Australians.|$|E

25|$|Slade {{ordered a}} charge, which threw back the French horsemen. The British dragoons galloped wildly after the fleeing Frenchmen, {{capturing}} about 100 cavalrymen. Slade failed to reform his troopers and they soon {{came up with}} the reserve French squadron. This unit waited until their adversaries had covered a mile before attacking the disorganised British from flank and rear. The five defeated squadrons also turned on their <b>tormentors</b> and the result was a rout of the British.|$|E
25|$|Second time around, only Stewart (69*) {{could muster}} any resistance, with Extras {{contributing}} the next highest score (28) {{in a total}} of 175. Wasim Akram's 4–66 was earned mostly at the expense of England's tail. Pakistan made their target of 138 look like hard work, falling to 18–3 and 95–8 with Lewis (3–43) and Ian Salisbury (3–49) their main <b>tormentors.</b> Once again, Wasim and Waqar combined to win the match – only this time with the bat. A dogged 45 not out from Wasim and strong support from Waqar (20*) saw Pakistan home.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions in Justine seem to {{anticipate}} Radcliffe's scenery in The Mysteries of Udolpho and the vaults in The Italian, but, unlike these stories, {{there is no}} escape for Sade's virtuous heroine, Justine. Unlike the milder Gothic fiction of Radcliffe, Sade's protagonist is brutalized throughout and dies tragically. To have a character like Justine, who is stripped without ceremony and bound to a wheel for fondling and thrashing, would be unthinkable in the domestic Gothic fiction written for the bourgeoisie. Sade even contrives a kind of affection between Justine and her <b>tormentors,</b> suggesting shades of masochism in his heroine.|$|E

Godfrey (known as 'God' for short) suggests having the Professor {{keep an eye on}} him. His <b>tormentor</b> has a flashback of being committed to an insane asylum and being tied down to a bed. When the maid Amelia (whom the <b>tormentor</b> evidently knows) attempts to blackmail Roberto's <b>tormentor,</b> the person locks her inside of a city park after hours and kills her with a straight razor.|$|R
25|$|They are not {{reduced to}} ashes there, {{and they do}} not die of their {{enormous}} pains; undergoing this punishment, the miserable men suffer for their misdeeds. And there in the place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the <b>tormentors</b> torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Sebastian (who {{had been}} rescued {{by his friend}} Antonio, a brigand who Orsino wants arrested) arrives on the scene, which adds {{confusion}} of mistaken identity. Mistaking Sebastian for 'Cesario', Olivia asks him to marry her, and they are secretly married in a church. Finally, when 'Cesario' and Sebastian appear {{in the presence of}} both Olivia and Orsino, there is more wonder and confusion at their similarity. At this point, Viola reveals her disguise and that Sebastian is her twin brother. The play ends in a declaration of marriage between Duke Orsino and Viola, and it is learned that Sir Toby has married Maria. Malvolio swears revenge on his <b>tormentors</b> and stalks off, but Orsino sends Fabian to placate him.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, the 11th Regiment {{fought in}} John Sullivan's right column. The attack {{was led by}} Thomas Conway's 3rd Pennsylvania Brigade. In the foggy dawn, Conway's men engaged the British 2nd Light Infantry Battalion at Mount Airy. Sullivan fed in his own {{division}} of two Maryland brigades on the right flank while Wayne deployed his two brigades on the left of Germantown Road. As at Brandywine, Hartley's 1st Brigade formed on the right, next to the road, while Humpton's 2nd Brigade, including the 11th Regiment, deployed on the left. Faced with their <b>tormentors</b> of Paoli, Wayne's men attacked in a battle frenzy. Set upon by the Pennsylvanians and Marylanders, the 2nd Light Infantry were routed {{for the first time}} and suffered the loss of their camp.|$|E

25|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of naturalism and {{the depiction of}} realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two <b>tormentors</b> dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is {{a photograph of a}} crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.|$|E
25|$|Carey's Squadron Leader {{had ordered}} him to cover the {{squadron}} with just three other pilots. A large number of escorting Bf 109s engaged his three-man section. Carey {{was able to get}} into firing positions several times before a Bf 110 hit him with cannon fire. The round hit the port wing and exploded the ammunition stored there, causing a large hole. The Hurricane turned onto its back and Carey noticed blood seeping from his hands and arm. He corrected the attitude of the aircraft and succeeded in attacking a flight of Bf 109s from astern and hit one but was again attacked and hit by a Bf 110 which shot off his rudder and one elevator. The fight had taken him near to Cherbourg and he decided to extract himself and fly to Tangmere. The Hurricane, P3202, was later repaired. 43 Squadron's <b>tormentors</b> in the battle were probably from V./LG 1.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the <b>Tormentors,</b> Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is None of Your Business. He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E
