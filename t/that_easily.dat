G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|The joint {{attack against}} the Liao had been planned for 1121, but it was rescheduled for 1122. In February 23 of that year, the Jin {{captured}} the Liao Central Capital as promised. The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the Western Xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by Fang La in the south. When a Song army under Tong Guan's command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122, the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease. Another attack failed in the fall. Both times, Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng. After the first attack, Aguda changed {{the terms of the}} agreement and only promised Yanjing and six other prefectures to the Song. In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces <b>that</b> <b>easily</b> took the Liao Southern Capital. They sacked it and enslaved its population.|$|E

England's {{resistance}} didn't end, however, and despite Lee ripping out wickets – ending with five for 41 – the lower-order combined, eking out 30 from the last 21 balls to lift England to a somewhat defensible total of 223 for 8.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{falling to}} the SDSU Aztecs in their conference opener in a very close game, the Runnin' Rebels responded with soundly {{defeating}} New Mexico, the preseason Mountain West favorite, at home {{in front of a}} sold out crowd as well as blowing out an up–and–coming Colorado State club <b>that</b> <b>easily</b> beat that at UNLV the previous year. Despite narrowly winning road games against Air Force and Boise State, UNLV was ranked #11 in the country, which set up for an early February Top 15 showdown against San Diego State, which won 9 of the last 10 meetings. In front of a rejuvenated UNLV student section and a capacity crowd, UNLV played a near–perfect game, only to let up in the closing minutes, but key defensive stops in the final seconds allowed UNLV to come atop 65–63. However, the Rebels blew an 18–point lead in the following game against lowly TCU, and despite scoring 97 points, they lost in overtime. This set up numerous road losses down the stretch, but still finished a respectable 9–5 in conference play and 3rd seed in the tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to New Mexico. Granted a six seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, the Runnin' Rebels were upset in the opening round to Colorado despite trimming a 21–second point deficit to 2 in a 68–64 loss.|$|E

500|$|The {{minstrel}} show {{marked the}} beginning of a long tradition of African American music being appropriated for popular audiences, and was the first distinctly American form of music to find international acclaim, in the mid-19th century.

Clarke attributes the use of blackface to a desire for white Americans to glorify the brutal existence of both free and slave blacks by depicting them as happy and carefree individuals, best suited to plantation life and the performance of simple, joyous songs <b>that</b> <b>easily</b> appealed to white audiences.|$|E
