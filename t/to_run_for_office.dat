5|$|Aubame {{participated in}} the 1944 Brazzaville Conference and served in this post until 10 November 1946. After Éboué's sudden death in March 1944, Aubame worked {{as an adviser to}} Governor-General André Bayardelle and his {{secretary}} André Soucadoux. They encouraged Aubame <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office,</b> and he returned to Gabon to campaign with the support of both the administration and the missionaries.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be able <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office,</b> a {{candidate}} must be a Belarusian citizen by birth that is over thirty-five years old. The candidate must also reside within the Republic for ten years and he or she must be able to cast a ballot legally. The provisions are set down in Article 80 of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office,</b> the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E

50|$|McNair {{became a}} sort of {{political}} sideshow after he left <b>office,</b> continuing <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>offices</b> unsuccessfully and giving political speeches and rallies for various causes. He died in St. Louis, Missouri in 1948 during a political rally and is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.|$|R

5|$|Among the organisations that Playford {{belonged to}} was the local {{branch of the}} Liberal Federation, yet until the months {{preceding}} his eventual election, he never talked of holding political office. The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the Country Party to avoid Labor retaining office during the Great Depression. Archie Cameron, an old wartime friend of Playford's and a federal Coalition MP, influenced Playford <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office</b> when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the Liberal and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E
5|$|Daly {{returned}} to Fairfield {{after he was}} discharged from the Army and began a business career. He worked very briefly as a salesman for an oil company before starting his own manufacturer's representative business, Michael Daly & Associates, in the Southport neighborhood. He was also involved in the operations of St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, serving on the hospital's board of directors for more than thirty years, {{as well as being}} a trustee and helping to obtain financial support for the hospital. A Democrat, he also supported the political careers of his brother, Judge T. F. Gilroy Daly, and friend, city politician John J. Sullivan, but dismissed suggestions <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{a lifelong}} {{member of the}} Liberal Party, which until the 1920s {{had been one of}} the two main {{political}} parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office</b> himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the Labour Party.|$|E

5|$|Ford reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office</b> in 1976, {{but first}} he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Hindman joined Confederate {{refugees}} in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office,</b> he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though he}} did not pursue or seek out elected office, Sprigg was {{repeatedly}} called upon <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office</b> by the West Virginia Democratic Party. After his term as attorney general, he was elected to several terms as mayor of Moorefield. In 1888, despite his protest before the Democratic Party state convention, he was nominated to run for a seat in West Virginia House of Delegates representing the Second Delegate District, which consisted of Grant and Hardy counties. He was elected following a highly contested campaign and served for the 1889 legislative session. During his tenure, Sprigg served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was initially a candidate for Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Also in 1888, Sprigg was selected as part of West Virginia's attending delegation to the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison. To resolve the disputed results of the 1888 gubernatorial election between Aretas B. Fleming and Nathan Goff, Jr., Sprigg was appointed in April 1889 as secretary of a joint committee of the West Virginia Legislature charged with investigating and deciding the results of the election. While serving on the committee, he was a dominant spokesman for the Democratic side in support of Fleming, who was ultimately chosen as the winner of the election.|$|E

25|$|Suffrage, {{political}} franchise, {{or simply}} franchise {{is the right}} to vote in public, political elections (although the term is sometimes used for any right to vote). The right <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>office</b> is sometimes called candidate eligibility, and the combination of both rights is sometimes called full suffrage.
