5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E

5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 Î¼m. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E

25|$|While {{the idea}} of shared {{electron}} pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed {{to understand the nature}} of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.|$|E
25|$|Metformin is {{generally}} recommended {{as a first}} line treatment for type2 diabetes, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> evidence that it decreases mortality. It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose. Several other groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, may also decrease blood sugar in type II DM. These include agents that increase insulin release, agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines, and agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin. When insulin is used in type2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications. Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.|$|E

25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a {{continuance}} may {{be granted}} {{in a criminal}} case if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> reason documents pertinent to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with a criminal trial {{in the absence of a}} previous trial transcript, when such contains pertinent information that should have been considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy. The trial judge or magistrate is the one who issues the continuance.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} copperânickel alloys, {{corrosion}} resistance of copperâsilicon {{is due to}} protective films that form on the surface {{over a period of}} time. General corrosion rates of 0.025â0.050mm have been observed in quiet waters. This rate decreases towards {{the lower end of the}} range over long-term exposures (e.g., 400â600 days). There is generally no pitting with the silicon-bronzes. Also <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> resistance to erosion corrosion up to moderate flow rates. Because copperâsilicon is weldable, rigid pens can be constructed with this material. Also, because welded copperâsilicon mesh is lighter than copper-zinc chain link, aquaculture enclosures made with copperâsilicon may be lighter in weight and therefore a potentially less expensive alternative.|$|E

25|$|Because free {{radicals}} {{are necessary for}} life, the body {{has a number of}} mechanisms to minimize free-radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. In addition, antioxidants {{play a key role in}} these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E and polyphenol antioxidants. Furthermore, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> evidence indicating that bilirubin and uric acid can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain {{free radicals}}. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of red blood cells' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of purines. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to jaundice, which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes gout.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth kept {{a female}} {{companion}} with her {{most of the}} time. This person was not exactly a servant, but she would act in that role.

Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott was in this function and says that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> reason to suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.|$|E
25|$|A-minor motifs {{have been}} {{separated}} into four classes, types 0 to III, {{based upon the}} position of the inserting base relative to the two 2â-OHâs of the Watson-Crick base pair. In type I and II A-minor motifs, N3 of adenine is inserted deeply within the minor groove of the duplex (see figure: A minor interactions - type II interaction), and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> shape complementarity with the base pair. Unlike types 0 and III, type I and II interactions are specific for adenine due to hydrogen bonding interactions. In the type III interaction, both the O2' and N3 of the inserting base are associated less closely with the minor groove of the duplex. Type 0 and III motifs are weaker and non-specific because they are mediated by interactions with a single 2â-OH (see figure: A-minor Interactions - type 0 and type III interactions).|$|E
