5|$|The Terrible <b>Towel</b> is a rally <b>towel</b> {{associated}} with the Pittsburgh Steelers, an American football team in the National Football League (NFL). The Terrible <b>Towel</b> has spread in popularity; for example, fans take their <b>Towel</b> to famous sites while on vacation. The <b>Towel</b> has been taken to the peak of Mount Everest, and even into space on the International Space Station. It is widely recognized {{as a symbol of}} the Steelers and the city of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2009, at {{a public}} sendoff in Phoenix for the Arizona Cardinals before they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon {{produced}} a <b>towel</b> and called the Cardinals mascot, Big Red to the stage, where he used the <b>towel</b> to wipe his armpits. Gordon then blew his nose on the <b>towel.</b> The Cardinals then proceeded to lose the Super Bowl to the Steelers, 27-23.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible <b>Towel,</b> Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible <b>Towel</b> logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible <b>Towel</b> was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the <b>Towel</b> is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur <b>Towel</b> & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a <b>towel</b> is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a <b>towel</b> into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's <b>towel.</b> As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's <b>towel.</b> After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Cope {{retired after}} 35 {{years as the}} Steelers radio announcer—the longest tenure of any {{broadcaster}} with a single team in NFL history. Cope was honored by the Steelers {{with the release of}} a limited special edition <b>Towel,</b> featuring his name and catch phrases. Cope was made an honorary co-captain for the Steelers for a Monday night game against the Baltimore Ravens. Cope led the fans in a <b>towel</b> wave at half time; the <b>Towel</b> that Cope used is now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{inception}} of the Terrible <b>Towel,</b> numerous opposing teams, mascots, and players have shown disrespect or have defaced the Terrible <b>Towel,</b> and every such instance has resulted in some form of a negative consequence to the team or player or both.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 73) A two part study, {{a consumer}} questionnaire and laboratory investigation, {{was conducted on}} the absorbency qualities of velour versus terry cloth <b>towels</b> when laundered with and without fabric softeners. Consumer opinions on preference of type of <b>towels</b> for aesthetic value were obtained. Chi Square statistical test was utilized for comparative analysis based on marital status, age, educational level, and family income. Fifty per cent of the respondents owned velour bath towels: of these 52 per cent rated velour <b>towels</b> as not very absorbent. All of the respondents owned terry cloth <b>towels</b> and 70 per cent of these rated terry cloth as very absorbent. The majority of the respondents who used fabric softeners stated the fabric softener made no difference in the absorbency of the <b>towels.</b> Velour <b>towels</b> were preferred for aesthetic value, but the overall preference was for the terry cloth <b>towels.</b> The laboratory investigation included weight, and wick-up tests. The results revealed that terry cloth was superior to velour in absorbency. The addition of fabric softeners greatly reduced the absorbability of both types of <b>towels.</b> Light weight <b>towels,</b> terry cloth and velour, are more absorbent than are heavy weight <b>towels...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1996, Cope {{gave the}} rights to The Terrible <b>Towel</b> to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. The school {{provides}} care for more than 900 people with intellectual and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son, Danny. Proceeds from the Terrible <b>Towel</b> have helped raise more than $2.2 million for the school. During the 2005 season, when the Steelers won their fifth Super Bowl, more than 1 million Towels were sold; some fans bought 200 Towels at a time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has become}} a {{tradition}} for Steelers fans to take Terrible Towels on vacation, taking pictures next to well-known tourist destinations. Fans have taken the <b>Towel</b> to locations such as the Great Wall of China, the South Pole, Vatican City, and {{to the top of}} Mount Kilimanjaro. Hampton native Kevin Cherilla took his Terrible <b>Towel</b> during his climb to the peak of Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the <b>towel.</b> Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's <b>towel</b> in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the <b>towel</b> into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's <b>towel,</b> and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the <b>towel</b> over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E

50|$|Paper <b>towels</b> are {{a global}} product with rising {{production}} and consumption. Being second in tissue consumption only to toilet paper (36% vs. 45% in the U.S.), {{the proliferation of}} the mostly non-recyclable paper <b>towels</b> has the same globally adverse effects on the environment as indicated in the tissue article. Better alternatives are still conventional <b>towels</b> or - for hand drying - hand dryers.

Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E

During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white <b>towel</b> {{on the end of}} a hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game.
