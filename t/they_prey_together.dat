50|$|These cones are generalists. They are: molluscivorous (<b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on {{gastropods}} and bivalves); vermivorous (<b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on polychaete marine worms); and piscivorous (the also prey on fish).|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism. An example is the male lion, which compared with the female lion possesses a mane, larger size, larger upper canines, and operates in a group of no more than two or three. There is little variance among male and female canids. Canids tend to live as monogamous pairs, and wolves, dholes, and jackals also along with their offspring. Wolves may live in extended family groups. To take prey larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with <b>prey.</b> <b>They</b> work <b>together</b> as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. Social mammal predators prey on herbivores with a body mass {{similar to that of the}} combined mass of the predator pack. The gray wolf specializes in predating on the vulnerable individuals of large prey, and a pack of timber wolves can bring down a 500 kg moose.|$|R

50|$|These {{species are}} molluscivorous (meaning that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on other mollusks).|$|R
50|$|These {{species are}} vermivorous (meaning that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on marine worms).|$|R
50|$|These {{species are}} vermivorous, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on polychaete worms.|$|R
50|$|Larvae of Luciola cruciata are aquatic. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> on Semisulcospira libertina snails.|$|R
2500|$|... 1570 – Japanese pirates occupy {{parts of}} Taiwan, from where <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on China.|$|R
50|$|The black-legged seriema {{is similar}} to its relative, the red-legged seriema, Cariama cristata. However, the black-legged seriema is more {{arboreal}} than its cousin, and it prefers {{to spend more time}} in trees. They often live together in family groups, and hunt <b>prey</b> <b>together.</b>|$|R
50|$|These large herons are {{associated}} with wetlands where <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on fish, frogs, and other aquatic species.|$|R
50|$|Nicrosaurus {{in general}} have massive snouts similar to extanct crocodilians, {{suggesting}} <b>they</b> <b>preyed</b> on tetrapods instead of fish.|$|R
50|$|Chrysopelea are diurnal, {{which means}} they hunt during the day. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> upon lizards, rodents, frogs, birds, and bats.|$|R
50|$|These {{species are}} {{presumed to be}} vermivorous (meaning that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on marine worms) based upon their radular morphology.|$|R
50|$|Predators of the red-billed buffalo weaver include hawks, eagles, snakes, and baboons. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> on both {{adult and}} {{adolescent}} birds.|$|R
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>prey</b> {{on various}} species of lizards, small snakes, and birds, they also feed on other mammals {{in the wild}} ...|$|R
25|$|Jewel spiders are {{opportunistic}} predators. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> {{on small}} flying insects like flies and mosquitoes that get entangled on their webs.|$|R
50|$|The spider family Aphantochilidae was {{incorporated}} into the Thomisidae in the late 1980s. Aphantochilus species mimic Cephalotes ants, on which <b>they</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{species are}} {{presumed to be}} vermivorous (meaning that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on marine worms) based upon the aspect of the radular tooth.|$|R
50|$|Circaetus eagles have {{a rounded}} head and broad wings. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> on reptiles, mainly snakes, but also take lizards and {{occasionally}} small mammals.|$|R
50|$|Individuals of {{this species}} search for food actively; they feed mainly on small invertebrates. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> preferably on oligochaetes, and also on gastropods.|$|R
50|$|They {{are mostly}} small (between 5 and 10 mm) and rather {{hard to find}} because they are very well camouflaged. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> on encrusting bryozoans.|$|R
5000|$|These {{species are}} vermivorous (meaning that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on marine worms). [...] Calamiconus lischkeanus (Weinkauff, 1875) {{has been found}} feeding on polychaetes, Amphinomidae, and Terebellidae.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the owl, {{this species}} is also nocturnal. However <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on eating insects and {{occasionally}} bats, which they capture in sallies from high perches.|$|R
50|$|For {{the past}} 100 years, Rüppell's foxes {{have been treated}} like a pest. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> on many {{livestock}} animals in Arabia, including chickens, lambs, and young goats.|$|R
50|$|These wasps {{occur in}} open sandy {{habitats}} where the females can burrow easily to create nests. <b>They</b> <b>prey</b> on spiders {{of the families}} Araneidae, Lycosidae and Tetragnathidae.|$|R
50|$|Like {{others in}} the genus, <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on ants, social wasps and other arthropods. Some forms of the species such as formosensis of Taiwan were earlier {{considered}} separate species.|$|R
50|$|Recorded {{breeding}} seabird and wader {{species are}} little penguin, white-faced storm-petrel, sooty oystercatcher, pied oystercatcher and Caspian tern. Rats are present, with evidence that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on the storm-petrels.|$|R
50|$|The diet of Vipera xanthina {{is thought}} to consist of rodents and other small mammals and native birds. It has also been speculated that <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on lizards as well.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} privateers of other nationalities, however, {{they were often}} {{considered}} pirates by their foreign opponents, and might be hanged as pirates if captured by the foreigners <b>they</b> <b>preyed</b> on.|$|R
2500|$|Trumpeter whiting are benthic {{carnivores}} {{during their}} adult life, and like other sillaginids undergo {{a change in}} diet as they grow older. Juveniles are often considered to not be benthic, as they feed {{on a variety of}} planktonic prey, with [...] mysids, amphipods and rarely polychaetes the main <b>prey.</b> <b>They</b> also <b>prey</b> on a variety of meiobenthos, with copepods the predominant form taken. Once they reach over 10cm in size, they move into deeper water where <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> predominantly on polychaetes, bivalves, ophiuroidea and brachyura.|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} predators are about {{ten times as}} long as the larvae <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on. This is true regardless of whether the predator is a crustacean, a jellyfish, or a fish.|$|R
5000|$|A bounty is {{in place}} for {{northern}} pikeminnow greater than 9 inches because <b>they</b> <b>prey</b> on small salmon. Anglers get $5 for the first 24 caught, $6 for 25-199, $8 for 200+, and $500 for tagged fish.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century, pirates {{arrived in}} the Indian Ocean from the Caribbean and made a base in Madagascar, from where <b>they</b> <b>preyed</b> upon vessels {{approaching}} and leaving the Red Sea and the Gulf.|$|R
