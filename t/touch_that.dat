5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod <b>Touch</b> <b>that</b> presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 Holst {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, feeling that she might possess the required light <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> he thought his own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic Hour, was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of husband and wife, however, the sages added on extra restrictions, {{including}} <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> is not in an affectionate or lustful manner, passing of objects even without touching, and sleeping in the same bed; these restrictions are to avoid the risk of leading to sexual contact.

25|$|During the {{production}} of This Binary Universe, Transeau wanted to program drums in surround sound, and found that software tools to accomplish this weren't readily available. He decided to develop his own, forming his own software company, Sonik Architects, to create a line of sound design tools for the studio and another line of tools and plug-ins designed for live performance. The company's first release was the drum machine surround sound sequencer BreakTweaker, a PC plug-in. In 2009, Sonik Architects released Sonifi, a product for the iPhone, iPad and iPod <b>Touch</b> <b>that</b> enables musicians to replicate BT's stutter edit effect live.

500|$|In late 1913, Barrymore {{made his}} first {{confirmed}} feature film, the romantic comedy An American Citizen, with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company. When the film was released in January 1914, Barrymore [...] "delighted movie audiences with an inimitable light <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> made a conventional romance 'joyous'," [...] writes Peters. A reviewer for The Oregon Daily Journal thought that Barrymore gave a [...] "portrayal of unusual quality". The success of the picture led to further film work, including The Man from Mexico (1914), Are You a Mason?, The Dictator and The Incorrigible Dukane (all 1915). Except for The Incorrigible Dukane, all of these early films are presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|Writer {{and acting}} coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman's work ethic with his impressions. He {{assembled}} {{a collection of}} video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he [...] "completely embodied the person". Ryan concluded that [...] "what made [...] so funny and spot on was Phil's ability to add that perfect <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors." [...] Hartman described this process as [...] "technical." [...] Journalist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman showed a [...] "rare talent for morphing into [...] anybody he wanted to be".|$|E

500|$|Other reviews were encouraging. In Maclean's {{magazine}} Brian Bethune {{wrote it}} was [...] "an elegant and learned discussion" [...] on the topic. The review in The Times {{said it was}} [...] "an eminently readable account...written with an incredible lightness of <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> belies the very serious issues." [...] In the Montreal Gazette, Bryan Demchinsky called Wright eloquent and the book [...] "a brief, trenchant essay." [...] Diane Barlee in Skeptic magazine, said Wright is a [...] "remarkably gifted wordsmith whose talent makes turgid facts not only digestible, but also generates a hunger for more" [...] and commented [...] "A Short History of Progress is an important, well-crafted book, however, I can't promise that it will change your life." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety called Edge of Tomorrow [...] "a cleverly crafted and propulsively {{executed}} sci-fi thriller", {{saying that}} the film was director Doug Liman's best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said that the screenwriters, {{with the assistance of}} the editors, [...] "tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt's characters, Chang said [...] "Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> extends to the proceedings as a whole." [...] He also commended the visual effects of the [...] "expertly designed Mimics" [...] as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography.|$|E
500|$|Eisenberg has obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and is open about it. He {{said of his}} condition: [...] "I touch the tips of my fingers in a weird way; I don't step on cracks; if I'm going onto a new surface – be it carpet to concrete, or concrete to wood, or wood to concrete, any new surface – I {{have to make sure}} all parts of my feet touch the ground equally before I <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> new thing. So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope. He has said that acting serves as his coping mechanism.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Blue Gardenia was positive overall. Jonathan Widran wrote a positive review for the album, complimenting Walton's arrangements and the featured soloists. Widran {{also said that}} each track allowed James to [...] "explore both tenderness and guttural emotions" [...] and that James' mother's contributions to the title track provided a [...] "unique <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> [...] emotional dimension to an already emotionally rich affair". Music critic Robert Christgau awarded the album an [...] "A–" [...] rating and wrote that James [...] " [...] the songs do the talking and [...] you to wonder whether her modest melodic variations bespeak sly musicality or weathered pipes." [...] Isaac Guzman of the New York Daily News thought that the album showcased James' ability to [...] "get inside the gentle nuances of classic torch songs and ballads". Dorothy Hill noted the blues sound of the album and the [...] "ache" [...] in James' voice. She complimented the performances by the guest musicians appearing on the album, including Hawkins, whose vocal contribution Hill called [...] "unpolished but alluring".|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Disney, Pixar, and the Hidden Messages of Children's Films, M. Keith Booker states that FernGully [...] "focuses {{on the theme}} of the {{destruction}} of the earth’s rainforests. In this case the rainforest is located near Mount Warning, on the eastern coast of Australia, but the theme is global and the specific location is not particularly emphasized". Despite the environmental theme Booker stated the film was [...] "somewhat vague in its explanation of the dire consequences of rainforest destruction and it addresses the economic impetus behind this destruction hardly at all"; the fact that the rainforest was saved {{at the end of the}} film [...] "diminishes the urgency of its environmentalist message" [...] and that the character of Hexxus [...] "displaces the real blame for environmental destruction from its real perpetrators onto nonexistent supernatural perpetrators, further diluting the political message." [...] The character of Batty was said to introduce [...] "the secondary theme of animal experimentation, though with a light <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> presents this potentially horrifying motif as essentially humorous." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy {{said it did}} so with a lightness of <b>touch</b> <b>that</b> granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", WALL-E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E
