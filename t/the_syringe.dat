5|$|Scully is told by {{the scarred}} man that William is part alien and that she {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{syringes}} {{help reduce}} occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One {{of the most}} recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> or rendering <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a hinging cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the needle remover. Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from <b>the</b> <b>syringe.</b> This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separate from <b>the</b> <b>syringe.</b> There is debate around the use of these devices as they involved in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} cells contained in needles {{used for the}} collection of breast fine needle aspirates {{for the detection of}} malignant cells trapped in the needles. Remnants of cells contained in 50 needles used for the collection of scanty breast fine needle aspirates were examined by the liquid based cytology technique and compared with the conventional cytological technique of specimens in <b>the</b> corresponding <b>syringes.</b> <b>The</b> breast specimens were collected with clean sterile needles attached to <b>the</b> <b>syringes.</b> Smears were made and stained by the conventional method. The needles were removed from <b>the</b> <b>syringes</b> and a fixative was withdrawn into <b>the</b> <b>syringes</b> and <b>the</b> <b>syringes</b> were recapped with the needles. The fixative containing the specimen was then completely discharged into a centrifuge tube through the needles and treated by the liquid based cytology technique. The study revealed that cells were found trapped in all the needles used for the collection of breast FNA. 6 % of them were positive for malignancy, similar to results obtained in the conventional method. Needles used for the collection of breast FNA should be examined before malignancy is completely ruled out particularly in extremely scanty specimens with a clinical suspicion of malignancy...|$|R

25|$|Around {{the same}} time that menstrual {{extraction}} was first used in the United States, a method utilizing nearly identical technology was beginning to be used internationally. This method, another type of Manual Vacuum Aspiration, is most often called Menstrual Regulation. As with ME, menstrual regulation, when desired as a method of controlling fertility, is performed very early in the menstrual cycle, earlier than a pregnancy test can be performed. One main difference between these two methods is the equipment used. While the Del Em was created such that one is able to put it together from individual pieces and it consists of three parts: the cannula with a one-way valve, a collection jar and <b>the</b> <b>syringe,</b> which are connected by plastic tubing; Menstrual Regulation is performed with a commercially produced kit which consists of two parts, the cannula with a one-way valve and a directly connected syringe. With this kit, the contents of the uterus are sucked directly into <b>the</b> <b>syringe.</b> ME is performed by a group; Menstrual Regulation is performed by an individual practitioner.|$|E
25|$|The most {{convenient}} site {{is often the}} arm, especially the veins {{on the back of}} the hand, or the median cubital vein at the elbow, but any identifiable vein can be used. Often it is necessary to use a tourniquet which restricts the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge. Once the needle is in place, it is common to draw back slightly on <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> to aspirate blood, thus verifying that the needle is really in a vein. The tourniquet should be removed before injecting to prevent extravasation of the medication.|$|E
25|$|Pascal's work in {{the fields}} of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics {{centered}} on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and <b>the</b> <b>syringe.</b> He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up {{to the level of the}} third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.|$|E
50|$|Cannula {{transfer}} or cannulation is {{a subset}} of air-free techniques used with a Schlenk line, in transferring liquid or solution samples between reaction vessels via cannulae, avoiding atmospheric contamination.

30|$|Norepinephrine {{is a key}} {{drug for}} {{treating}} shock but has a short half-life that requires continuous intravenous administration to maintain the constant plasma concentration needed to obtain a stable blood pressure. The small volume of <b>the</b> <b>syringes</b> used in power infusion pumps requires frequent changeovers, {{which can lead to}} norepinephrine flow interruptions responsible for hemodynamic instability. Changeovers from the nearly empty to <b>the</b> full <b>syringe</b> can be performed manually using the quick change technique (QC) or automatically using smart infusion pumps (SIP) that link two <b>syringes.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that, compared to QC, SIP for norepinephrine changeovers was associated with less hemodynamic instability.|$|R
30|$|Detection of {{the foam}} volume and the foam FHT: Once the foam was produced, it was {{immediately}} pushed into 10 and 20  ml scalar <b>syringes</b> respectively, <b>the</b> scalar <b>syringes</b> were placed vertically with the piston beneath.

The foam in <b>the</b> <b>syringes</b> gradually separated into liquid and air, with the liquid sclerosant gathered at the bottom, when half volume of the liquid sclerosant was reverted, the time as FHT was recorded.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid adverse {{side-effects}} from the possible presence of surfactants, an alternative casting process can be used involving a frit compression method that did not {{require the use of}} surfactants or surface modification. The dimensions can be controlled through the size of <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> housing and through the mass of carbon nanotubes added. Their thicknesses are typically much larger than surfactant-cast buckypaper and have been synthesized from 120 μm up to 650 μm; whilst no nomenclature system exists to govern thicknesses for samples to be classified as paper, samples with thicknesses greater than 500 μm are referred to as buckydiscs. The frit compression method allows rapid casting of buckypaper and buckydiscs with recovery of the casting solvent and control over the 2D and 3D geometry.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{experiments}} are {{often cited as}} against medical ethics, especially on his vaccination of Meister. He {{did not have any}} experience in medical practice, and more importantly, a medical license. This is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal reputation. His closest partner Émile Roux, who had medical qualifications, refused to participate in the clinical trial, likely because he considered it unjust. However, Pasteur executed vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physicians Jacques-Joseph Grancher, head of the Paris Children's Hospital's paediatric clinic, and Alfred Vulpian, a member of the Commission on Rabies. He was not allowed to hold <b>the</b> <b>syringe,</b> although the inoculations were entirely under his supervision. It was Grancher who was responsible for the injections, and he defended Pasteur before the French National Academy of Medicine in the issue.|$|E
25|$|To emplace the grafts of {{autologous}} fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin {{designed a}} lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of autologous fat-tissue {{to the desired}} recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>syringe,</b> thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1cm3 of filler. Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentation of the breast features the emplacement of adipocyte fat outside the breast parenchymaup to 300ml of fatin three equal measures (aliquots), is emplaced to the subpectoral space and to the intrapectoral space of the pectoralis major muscle, and the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.|$|E

500|$|A spermiating male {{indicates}} successful {{production of}} mature spermatozoa {{which results in}} the release of large volumes of milt {{over the course of}} three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization.

500|$|The {{substance}} that the suspect tried to detonate {{was more than}} [...] of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a crystalline powder that is often the active ingredient of plastic explosives, the high explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and other ingredients.

2500|$|In 1971, {{a member}} of a feminist {{reproductive}} health self-help group, Lorraine Rothman, modified equipment found in an underground abortion clinic that was developed for a new non-traumatic, manually-operated-suction abortion technique. Rothman took the thin, flexible plastic Karman cannula (about the size of a soda straw), and <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> (50 or 60ml), and added a one-way bypass valve, to fix two main problems. The contraption could prevent air from being pumped into the uterus, and also suctioned uterine contents directly into <b>the</b> <b>syringe,</b> thus limiting the amount that could be removed. Rothman's and Downer's group dubbed the new invention the [...] "Del Em." [...] Rothman added two lengths of clear plastic tubing, one from the cannula to the collection jar and another to go from the collection jar to <b>the</b> <b>syringe.</b> With this new set-up, the contents of the uterus went directly into the jar, allowing for the extraction of more material, and the two-way bypass valve diverted any air that may have been inadvertently pushed back toward the body to exit harmlessly into the air; this would prevent air from entering the uterus. By making it possible for more than one person to operate the device, the skill level of the operators was greatly reduced. One person could concentrate on guiding the sterile cannula through the vaginal cavity into the cervical os while another could pump <b>the</b> <b>syringe</b> to develop the vacuum. The Del Em made the procedure more comfortable, with personal control of the suction.|$|E
