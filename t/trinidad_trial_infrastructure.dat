40|$|Summary: The {{goal of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Clinical Trials Program is {{to foster}} {{clinical}} trials that will provide the evidence needed to inform clinical care. The NINDS currently supports clinical research in over 150 neurological disorders. The rapid pace of preclinical discovery and the diversity of neurological diseases, however, present challenges for clinical trials. There is {{a growing number of}} potential interventions to be tested in clinical trials. The NINDS Clinical Trials program is therefore exploring ways of making drug selection for clinical trials more evidence-based. Additionally, NINDS supports pilot clinical trials that focus on the timely and efficient testing of agents to determine if resource-intensive comparative efficacy trials are warranted. In concert with the National Institutes of Health Roadmap, NINDS is planning to expand clinical <b>trials</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> This infrastructure is intended to enable the conduct of clinical trials for rare diseases and diseases without previous trials experience and facilitate the recruitment of a broad range of participants. Rigorous programs to select agents, and design and monitor clinical trials will encourage the efficient use of this clinical <b>trials</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and will ensure that NINDS-funded studies meet the highest scientific and ethical standards...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{construction}} of the infrastructure for a Phase II gene therapy trial for Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Tracing the development of the material technologies and physical spaces used in the trial, we show how the <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> took form at the uncertain intersection of scientific norms, built environments, regulatory negotiations, patienthood, and the biologies of both disease and therapy. We define infrastructures as material and immaterial (including symbols and affect) composites that serve a selective distributive purpose and facilitate projects of making and doing. There is a politics to this distributive action, which is itself twofold, because whilst infrastructures enable and delimit the movement of matter, they also mediate the very activity for which they provide the grounds. An infrastructural focus allows us to show how purposeful connections are made in a context of epistemic and regulatory uncertainty. The gene therapy researchers were working in a context of multiple uncertainties, regarding not only how to do gene therapy, but also how to anticipate and enact ambiguous regulatory requirements in a context of limited resources (technical, spatial, and financial). At the same time, the <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> had to accommodate Cystic Fibrosis biology by bridging the gap between pathology and therapy. The consortium’s approach to treating CF required that they address concerns about contamination and safety while finding a way of getting a modified gene product into the lungs of the trial participants...|$|R

40|$|Barrett's {{oesophagus}} normally {{affects the}} distal oesophagus when metaplastic columnar lined epithelium replaces stratified squamous epithelium which predisposes to cancer development. This develops {{as a consequence}} of chronic gastroesophageal reflux (GORD). Those with Barrett's have a 40 fold increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma 1. There are is still a lack of understanding of the natural history of the cell of origin. This does hamper research into this area. We accept that there is a limitation in testing of the pathogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus {{due to a lack of}} a universally accepted animal model. The major questions surrounding Barrett's oesophagus include validity of surveillance strategies, the optimal treatment and more importantly an agent that can prevent progression to cancer without unacceptable side effects. The main chemopreventative agents that show promise are aspirin and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There are other agents such as green tea, berries and antioxidants and diet that have been suggested; we discuss the evidence available for these strategies.

Furthermore, clear associations exist between specific therapeutic exposures and the risk for a variety of long-term complications. The entire landscape of health issues encountered for decades after successful completion of treatment is currently being explored in various collaborative research settings. These settings include large population-based or multi-institutional cohorts and single-institution studies. The ascertainment of outcomes has depended on self-reporting, linkage to registries, or clinical assessments. Survivorship research in the cooperative group setting, such as the Children's Oncology Group, has leveraged the clinical <b>trials</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to explore the molecular underpinnings of treatment-related adverse events, and to understand specific complications in the setting of randomized risk-reduction strategies. This review highlights the salient findings from these large collaborative initiatives, emphasizing the need for life-long follow-up of survivors {{of childhood}} cancer, and describing the development of several guidelines and efforts toward harmonization. Finally, the review reinforces the need to identify populations at highest risk, facilitating the development of risk prediction models that would allow for targeted interventions across the entire trajectory of survivorship.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} equity, quality and {{relevance}} of clinical trials in children to inform better evidence-based child healthcare and outcomes worldwide. A {{comprehensive review of}} the literature revealed that despite current initiatives to encourage more trials in children, there is still a paucity of safety and efficacy data of many medicines prescribed in this population. An analysis of trials registered in children showed that disease burden was moderately correlated to trials and this scarcity was particularly prevalent in low-and middle-income countries. We explored the contributory factors to this inequity by conducting a systematic review of stakeholders’ views of trials in children in low-and middle-income countries. In the study evaluating the completeness of protocols of trials in children submitted to ethics committees, we found that protocols are generally comprehensive, but many key domains in trial design and conduct are not reported. Key-informant trial stakeholders who were interviewed proposed strategies to improve trials such as addressing the unique needs of children, embedding trials as part of routine clinical care and streamlining regulatory approvals. Increasing international collaboration, establishing sustainable centralised <b>trials</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and aligning research to child health priorities were proposed to encourage more high-quality trials that address global child healthcare needs...|$|R

I find that US-based nonprofits contributed $ 3. 7 billion to biomedical R&D in 2011, and that within certain disease areas nonprofit spending is comparable to or exceeds spending by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). I catalogue nonprofit activities and place them in a framework of five core functions: bridging gaps, enabling research, directing pipelines, informing stakeholders, and shaping markets. I present several case studies via this framework, discuss opportunities, and point out challenges such as a lack of conflict of interest standards. Methods included recording and analyzing publically available financial data from over 400 biomedical nonprofits, and conducting a series of in depth interviews with nonprofit executives and other related professionals. by Jordanna Polis Schutz.

The {{way in which the}} Brazilian Ministry of Health has supported clinical research to provide autonomy, self-sufficiency, competitiveness and innovation for the healthcare industrial production complex, in accordance with the National Policy on Science, Technology and Innovation in Healthcare, was analyzed. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive investigation, based on secondary data, conducted at the Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Health. METHODS: The Ministry of Health's research management database, PesquisaSaúde, was analyzed from 2002 to 2009, using the key word "clinical research" in the fields "primary sub-agenda" or "secondary sub-agenda". The 368 projects retrieved were sorted into six categories: basic biomedical research, preclinical studies, expanded clinical research, clinical <b>trials,</b> <b>infrastructure</b> support and health technology assessment. From a structured review on "clinical research funding", results from selected countries are presented and discussed. RESULTS: The amount invested was R$ 140 million. The largest number of projects supported "basic biomedical research", while the highest amounts invested were in "clinical trials" and "infrastructure support". The southeastern region had the greatest proportion of projects and financial resources. In some respects, Brazil is ahead of other BRICS countries (Russia, India, China and South Africa), especially with regard to establishing a National Clinical Research Network.

30|$|Cancer {{researchers}} {{have a unique}} opportunity to include naturally occurring cancers in pet dogs as translational models in the development path of new human cancer drugs, to the ultimate benefit to both species. Naturally occurring cancers in pet dogs and humans share many features, including histological appearance, tumor genetics, molecular targets, biological behavior, and response to both conventional and novel targeted cancer therapies. Formal integration of studies including pet dogs with cancer is becoming a more common component of an innovative cancer drug development process. Because no gold standard treatments exist for pet animals with cancer, new treatments can be provided to pet dogs with cancer at earlier stages of progression than human trials. Flexibility in the conduct and design of such trials permits serial collection of biologic samples and imaging endpoints during exposure to novel cancer agents. Lastly, cancer progresses at a faster rate in pet dogs than in humans; accordingly, these studies can be completed without interrupting the existing development path. The intramural NCI’s Center for Cancer Research established the comparative oncology program (COP) to develop this novel cancer drug development opportunity, address potential risks with this approach, and establish the organizational infrastructure to undertake translational clinical trials in pet dogs. This clinical <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> unites study sponsors with 22 academic veterinary centers to support multicenter clinical trials of investigational therapeutics. In this presentation we provide examples of such trials and the unique aspects of drug development that are addressed within the conduct and design of the trial.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recruitment into {{surgical}} RCTs can {{be threatened}} if new interventions available outside the trial compete with those being evaluated. Adapting the trial {{to include the}} new intervention may overcome this issue, yet this is not often done in surgery. This paper describes the challenges, rationale and methods for adapting an RCT to include a new intervention. METHODS: The By-Band study was designed in the UK in 2009 - 2010 to compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for severe obesity. It contained a pilot phase to establish whether recruitment was possible, and the grant proposal specified that an adaptation to include sleeve gastrectomy would be considered if practice changed and recruitment was successful. Information on changing obesity surgery practice, updated evidence and expert opinion about trial design were used to inform the adaptation. RESULTS: The pilot phase recruited over 13 months in 2013 - 2014 and randomized 80 patients (79 anticipated). During this time, major changes in obesity practice in the UK were observed, with gastric band reducing from 32 · 6 to 15 · 8 per cent and sleeve gastrectomy increasing from 9 · 0 to 28 · 1 per cent. The evidence base had not changed markedly. The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society and study oversight committees supported an adaptation to include sleeve gastrectomy, and a proposal to do so {{was approved by the}} funder. CONCLUSION: Adaptation of a two-group surgical RCT can allow evaluation of a third procedure and maintain relevance of the RCT to practice. It also optimizes the use of existing <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to answer an additional important research question. Registration number: ISRCTN 00786323 ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{challenges to}} the organization and conduct of international stem cell clinical trials {{in a context of}} regulatory pluralism. Multi-country clinical trial collaborations in stem cell medicine have the potential to speed up clinical developments and to widen access to new treatments among patients. However, the regulatory procedures through which the safety and efficacy of stem cell-based treatments are determined vary widely across countries. Internationally harmonized governance frameworks are not yet in place. In this chapter we show that this high level of regulatory variation and the absence of internationally binding standards for clinical stem cell research present important challenges to multi-country clinical trial collaborations. Four types of challenges will be highlighted. First is the need to inquire into and interact with regulatory procedures and law in multiple countries. Second, the interaction with medical authorities in multiple countries is resulting in a high level of organizational complexity. Third consists of delays, increased costs, and uncertainties that result from nonexistent, unclear, or still emerging regulatory arrangements in different countries. Fourth is that the high level of regulatory variation across countries necessitates far-reaching forms of scientific self-governance, training, and procedural adjustments in participating clinical trial sites. To illustrate this point, the chapter presents a case study of project-internal self-governance and capacity building {{in the context of a}} clinical <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that is active across the contexts of China, Hong Kong, and the USA. The chapter concludes with a call for the creation of an international support structure that systematically addresses these problems.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{examines}} the role and challenges of scientific self-governance and standardization in inter-continental clinical research partnerships in stem cell medicine. The paper shows that – due to {{a high level of}} regulatory diversity – the enactment of internationally recognized standards in multi-country stem cell trials is a complex and highly situation-specific achievement. Standardization is imposed on a background of regulatory, institutional and epistemic-cultural heterogeneity, and implemented exclusively in the context of select clinical projects. Based on ethnographic data from the first trans-continental clinical <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in stem cell medicine between China and the USA, the article demonstrates that locally evolved and international forms of experimental clinical research practices often co-exist in the same medical institutions. Researchers switch back and forth between these schemas, depending on the purposes of their research, the partners they work with, the geographic scale of research projects, and the contrasting demands for regulatory review, that result from these differences. Drawing on Birch's analysis of the role of standardization in international forms of capital production in the biosciences, the article argues that the integration of local knowledge institutions into the global bioeconomy does not necessarily result in the shutting down of localized forms of value production. In emerging fields of medical research, that are regulated in highly divergent ways across geographical regions, the coexistence of distinct modes of clinical translation allows also for the production of multiple forms of economic value, at varying spatial scales. This is especially so in countries with lenient regulations. As this paper shows, the long-standing absence of a regulatory framework for clinical stem cell applications in China, permits the situation-specific adoption of internationally recognized standards in some contexts, while enabling the continuation of localized forms of value production in others...|$|R
40|$|The Ravenna {{pine forests}} {{represent}} an historical landmark in the Po River Plain. They have great environmental, historical and tourist value. The San Vitale pine for- est is located 10 km {{north of the}} town. It is surrounded by an urban area, the city indus- <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the waterworks of the agricultural drainage system. Most land {{in this area is}} below mean sea level. As a result, no natural freshwater hydraulic gradient contrasts the density gradient of saltwater. In the last century, many events (land subsi- dence; land reclamation and drainage; urban and industrial development and gas and deep groundwater extractions; coastal dune destruction) led to the intrusion of large vol- umes of brackish and saline groundwater. Today the freshwater in this coastal aquifer con- sists of low salinity water lenses floating on the saltwater wedge. This study is aimed at understanding how past and present human activities have affected the saltwater intru- sion process in the phreatic aquifer and how the predicted future sea level rise will affect the salinisation process. We used a numerical model to quantify these effects on the den- sity-dependent groundwater flow, hydraulic head and salinity distribution, seepage and salt load fluxes to the surface water system. The simulations show that over the last cen- tury artificial subsidence and heavy drainage started the salinisation process in the study area and a relative sea level rise will accelerate the increase in salt load in the coming decades, affecting the entire aquifer. Climatic conditions in the area result in limited pre- cipitations throughout the year and preclude efficient aquifer recharge, especially in spring and summer when saltwater seepage is extensive. The lack of a continuous coastal dune system favors salt wedge intrusion...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the formation and governance of international clinical research collaborations {{in the field of}} regenerative stem cell medicine, and analyzes these processes against the background of the current transition to a multipolarizing scientific world system. The empirical point of departure of this study is an ethnographic analysis of the establishment of a trans-continental academia-centered clinical <b>trials</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> between researchers based in China, Hong Kong and the USA. Field research was carried out in mainland China and Hong Kong amongst scientists, clinical researchers, medical entrepreneurs, government regulators and patients, between April 2010 and May 2011. The dissertation contributes to debates on the processes and challenges that surround the global distribution of evidence-based medicine clinical research standards, and the study of science and globalization {{in the context of the}} emergence of new scientific, economic and geopolitical center regions in the world, with a particular focus on literature that comments on the scientific ascent of the People’s Republic of China. The dissertation reveals that the global diffusion of evidence-based clinical research standards, in regenerative stem cell medicine, is accompanied by the surfacing of vital forms of resistance and the creation of novel transnational spaces of alter-standardization, in which less rigorous, physician-based forms of experimental clinical practice are endorsed, publicized and tried to be legitimized. The dissertation uncovers, furthermore, that the creation of internationally standardized research zones, in the clinical stem cell field, is not necessarily a stable or constant process. The implementation of internationally recognized standards can be highly temporary and depends upon activation in specific situational contexts. Multiple modalities of experimental clinical practices continue to exist side by side to each other. Another line of theorization in this study {{focuses on the}} contemporary dynamics of global scientific multipolarization, and explores the empirical and theoretical implications of this trend for international clinical research collaborations. The dissertation argues that a new mode of clinical research partnerships may gradually be emerging. Processes of collective financiering and joint-innovation are giving rise to changing patterns of labour division, decision-making, benefit sharing, profit sharing and revised forms of ownership regarding inventions and research data. Based on a reflective engagement with postcolonial approaches to the study of science and technology, the dissertation concludes that new analytical perspectives are required, through which the empirical transformations and impact associated with the move toward a multipolarizing science system, can be captured in a more nuanced, and comprehensive manner...|$|R

ISCA developed its infrastructure sustainability (IS) rating tool to assess the sustainability of both new projects and the operation of existing assets. The tool drives improved sustainability performance of infrastructure across all infrastructure sectors and all stages of the infrastructure lifecycle. The tool was piloted extensively on new projects and is now being taken up enthusiastically by industry to rate sustainability performance. During piloting, the rating tool had only undergone limited <b>trials</b> on <b>infrastructure</b> operations so ISCA and IPWEA undertook a pilot trial on the road management activities of two local councils.

In 2008, the Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) launched with a vision of marshaling the exceptional cancer resources of the region to support the system of care provided to patients while keeping them “close to home”. With an emphasis on education and research, the MCA was developed to connect hospitals and physician groups across Kansas and western Missouri with the purpose of: Providing strong support to community cancer care professionals; Enhancing cancer care for patients across the region; Advancing access to innovative, investigator-initiated and cooperative group clinical trials; Advancing access to newly developed therapies and prevention strategies; Providing continuing professional and community education opportunities; Facilitating second opinion and consultation services; and Providing patient navigator technical assistance across the network. A membership-based organization, the MCA currently has 14 partners spanning the region including: Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics; Goodland Regional Medical Center; Hays Medical Center; Kansas Bioscience Authority; Kansas State University; Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center; Promise Regional Medical Center; Saint Luke's Health; Salina Regional Health Center; St. Francis Health Center; Stormont-Vail HealthCare; Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Truman Medical Center; The University of Kansas Hospital. Methods: In collaboration with members, the MCA facilitates a wide-array of cancer related services. Activities range from developing clinical <b>trial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> including, a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB), online Velos clinical trials management software to facilitate enrollment and trial data management, and access to Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), Clinical Trials Support Unit (CTSU) sponsored trials, and research initiated by The University of Kansas Cancer Center's Investigators. MCA provides professional and community education specific {{to the needs of the}} community. Members have access to The University of Kansas Cancer Center Tumor Boards as well as continuing education such as chemotherapy and oncology nurse certification curricula. Results: Numerous cancer-related activities have occurred since the inception of the MCA. Over 11, 450 individuals attended MCA community education and screening events. 6, 200 cancer screenings resulted in 470 + referrals back to local physicians for follow-up on abnormal results. Over 3, 096 Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) credits and 296 Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits. Five members have capacity to enroll patients through MCA sponsored trials with access to SWOG and CTSU. 7 cases have been presented at tumor boards. 9 second opinion consultations occurred through the use of telemedicine technology. Discussion: Less than three percent of adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials (Christian & Trimble, 2003). The MCA was established, in part, to address disparities such as this, in an effort to enhance the excellent cancer care provided across the region.

40|$|International audienceHyperparameter {{learning}} {{has traditionally been}} a manual task because of {{the limited number of}} <b>trials.</b> Today's computing <b>infrastructures</b> allow bigger evaluation budgets, thus opening the way for algorithmic approaches. Recently, surrogate-based optimization was successfully applied to hyperparameter learning for deep belief networks and to WEKA classifiers. The methods combined brute force computational power with model building about the behavior of the error function in the hyperparameter space, and they could significantly improve on manual hyperparameter tuning. What may make experienced practitioners even better at hyperparameter optimization is their ability to generalize across similar learning problems. In this paper, we propose a generic method to incorporate knowledge from previous experiments when simultaneously tuning a learning algorithm on new problems at hand. To this end, we combine surrogate-based ranking and optimization techniques for surrogate-based collaborative tuning (SCoT). We demonstrate SCoT in two experiments where it outperforms standard tuning techniques and single-problem surrogate-based optimization...|$|R

40|$|The immense {{progress}} made in childhood cancer survival has {{been due to}} the systematic and efficient conduct of large multicenter therapeutic <b>trials,</b> using the <b>infrastructure</b> developed by national cooperative groups. These therapeutic trials have been successful, {{in part due to}} the high participation rates by the parti-cipating member institutions. However, participation in nontherapeutic trials in the cooperative group set-ting has lagged behind that of therapeutic trials for a variety of reasons, such as lack of institutional resources, leading to low priority given to such acti-vities. The purpose of this report is to share some of the methods developed and successfully implemented by a coordinating center (City of Hope National Medical Center) to maximize institutional participation and patient enrollment and to standardize data collection and quality control, in order to ensure the successful execution of two large, extramurally funded, coopera-tive group nontherapeutic studies. To date, over 175 institutions have obtained regulatory approval for the protocols showcased here, accrual has been on target, and completeness and quality of the collected data have been excellent. The successful execution of these non-therapeutic studies shows the advantages of diverse study publicity techniques, detailed standardized ope-rating procedures, and effective utilization of techno-logical resources.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an {{infection}} of the subcutaneous tissue leading to chronic necrotizing skin ulcers. The causative pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans, grows best at 30 degrees C- 33 degrees C and not above 37 degrees C. We explored the safety, tolerability and efficacy of phase change material (PCM), a novel heat application system for thermotherapy of BU. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a prospective observational single centre proof-of-principle trial in Ayos/Cameroon, six laboratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative Buruli lesions received 28 - 31 (ulcers 2 cm) days of thermotherapy with the PCM sodium acetate trihydrate as heat application system. This PCM is widely used in commercial pocket heat pads, {{it is easy to}} apply, rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazardous to the environment. All patients enrolled in the trial completed treatment. Being completely mobile during the well-tolerated heat application, acceptability of the PCM bandages was very high. In patients with smaller ulcers, wounds healed completely without further intervention. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment. Heat treatment was not associated with marked increases in local inflammation or the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue. One and a half years after completion of treatment, all patients are relapse-free. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our reusable PCM-based heat application device appears perfectly suited to treat BU in endemic countries with limited resources and <b>infrastructure.</b> <b>TRIAL</b> REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials. com ISRCTN 8839261...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the networking architecture {{developed in the}} CASCOM research project. This architecture provides anefficient and reliable communication support and service discovery for pervasive intelligent P 2 P business applications. We give an overview how wireless environments and resource-poor devices {{are taken into account}} in our architecture. For that, we have designed and implemented anew agent platform for resource-poor devices, which is amodified version of JADE/LEAP. Agents are used to coordinate (semantic) web services in the health care domain. To support the discovery of such web services descriptions, we shortly describe adistributed directory system called WSDir. Itisbased on federation ofrepositories of web service descriptions thatare managed with pre-defined policies. Our architecture is being evaluated using a sample ad-hoc emergency health careassistance application scenario. 1 Introduction In this paper, we present the networking architecture developed in the CASCOM research project †. The main objective of CASCOM is to implement, validate, and <b>trial</b> value-added supportive <b>infrastructure</b> for business application services for mobile workers and users across mobile and fixed networks. The driving vision ofCASCOM is that ubiquitous business application services are flexibly coordinated and pervasively provided to the mobile worker/user by intelligent agents inthe dynamically changing contexts of open, large-scale, and pervasive environments. The application domain is pervasive eHealth. To achieve these goals, ageneric CASCOM architecture has been defined to combine intelligent agent technology, semantic Web services,peer-to-peer, and mobile computing for intelligent peer-to-peer mobile service environments. For this purpose, alayere...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the given}} project was to {{introduce}} clinical gene therapeutic studies relying {{on the use of}} retroviral vectors in Hamburg. During the period of support we were able to establish the technological basis for the successful execution of the supposed clinical <b>trials.</b> Moreover, the <b>infrastructure</b> to conduct gene transfer in accordance with the rules of 'good manufacturing practice' was created by the foundation of two small German biotech companies. In cooperation with our partner Heinrich-Pette-Institute (HPI) we initiated two clinical studies, which are going to start in 1999 and at the beginning of 2000, respectively. Because of the large interest of other clinics, the clinical study on adoptive immunotherapy with gene-modified T lymphocytes designed during this project will be carried out as an international phase I/II study {{under the direction of the}} Hamburg BMT center. During the project, efficient infection protocols for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and for the enrichment of gene-modified cells were developed. It was shown for the first time that the matrix protein fibronectin facilitates retroviral gene transfer into T lymphocytes. Recently, the first protocol for clinical gene transfer in the absence of bovine serum has been published by our group. Thereby, an important problem of biological safety during ex vivo transduction has been solved. In cooperation with or partner HPI, new retroviral vectors have been developed, which are characterized by better expression features in hematopoietic cells. (orig.)

40|$|Clinical trials {{conducted}} in Africa often require substantial investments to support trial centres {{and public health}} facilities. Trial resources could potentially generate benefits for routine health service delivery but may have unintended consequences. Strengthening ethical practice requires understanding the potential effects of trial inputs on the perceptions and practices of routine health care providers. This study explores the influence of malaria vaccine trials on health service delivery in Ghana, Kenya and Burkina Faso. We conducted: audits of trial inputs in 10 trial facilities and among 144 health workers; individual interviews with frontline providers (n= 99) and health managers (n= 14); and group discussions with fieldworkers (n= 9 discussions). Descriptive summaries were generated from audit data. Qualitative data were analysed using a framework approach. Facilities involved in <b>trials</b> benefited from <b>infrastructure</b> and equipment upgrades, support with essential drugs, access to trial vehicles, and placement of additional qualified trial staff. Qualified trial staff in facilities were often seen as role models by their colleagues; assisting with supportive supervision and reducing facility workload. Some facility staff in place before the trial also received formal training and salary top-ups from the trials. However, differential access to support caused dissatisfaction, and some interviewees expressed concerns {{about what would happen}} {{at the end of the}} trial once financial and supervisory support was removed. Clinical trials function as short-term complex health service delivery interventions in the facilities in which they are based. They have the potential to both benefit facilities, staff and communities through providing the supportive environment required for improvements in routine care, but they can also generate dissatisfaction, relationship challenges and demoralisation among staff. Minimising trial related harm and maximising benefits requires careful planning and engagement of key actors at the outset of trials, throughout the trial and on its' completion...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} need for targeted agents in cancer therapies, efficient clinical trials {{for the development}} of targeted agents are more and more important. Proper study design and statistical analysis {{play a crucial role in}} the success of clinical trials {{for the development of}} targeted agents. In this study, we evaluate the Bayesian adaptive randomization design (BAR) and the equally randomized (ER) marker stratified design, for the development of targeted agents. This study contains two parts. In the first part, we evaluate and decide the appropriate analysis approach for design evaluation in the second part. To achieve this goal, we simulate one-arm phase II clinical trials for the screening of targeted agents. We compare the frequentist score test and Bayesian analysis approaches with two different decision rules, i. e. controlling the type I error and minimizing the loss. Type I error, power and loss are computed to make the comparison. The Bayesian analysis approach controlling the type I error provides the same results as the frequentist score test. However, under the framework of drug development, the ultimate goal is to minimize the loss, not to control the type I error. Upon the proper specification of the utility functions of rejecting a good drug and accepting a bad drug, the Bayesian analysis approach can minimize the overall loss. In contrast to the frequentist framework, the Bayesian paradigm provides more flexibility in identifying the optimal treatment, for the inference is free of the preset sampling scheme. Thus, we use the two Bayesian analysis approaches for the design evaluation in the second part. In addition, we evaluate the equally randomized marker stratified design and the Bayesian adaptive randomization design for the testing of targeted agents. ER and BAR are simulated in two-arm phase II clinical trials with one marker. Type I error, power and loss are computed to make the comparison. By real time learning of the accumulated information, BAR is more flexible and efficient for the development of targeted agents, resulting in higher overall response rate, and shows comparable type I error, power and loss to ER. Thus BAR is suitable for the development of multiple targeted agents with multiple biomarkers. However, it takes more effort on the <b>trial</b> design, <b>infrastructure</b> setting up, <b>trial</b> analysis and reporting. To resemble what happens in the real world, one important new feature of this study is that the response rate of the drugs follows a statistical distribution rather than being a fixed value when we simulated the data. This better mimics the uncertainty and variability of the drugs, and provides us more accurate assessment of the performance of different clinical trial designs. Consequently, by improving the statistical properties of the clinical trial design, our study can benefit more patients participating in the clinical trial studies, and has important implications for improving public health in the general population. ...|$|R
