25|$|Leinster: Likewise, {{despite the}} adverse (and unforeseen) effects of Diarmait Mac Murchada's efforts {{to regain his}} kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> was that, of his twenty {{successor}}s up to 1632, {{most of them had}} regained much of the ground they had lost to the Normans, and exacted yearly tribute from the towns. His most dynamic successor was the celebrated Art mac Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh. The Ó Broin and Ó Tuathail largely contented themselves with raids on Dublin (which, incredibly, continued into the 18th century). The Ó Mordha of Laois and Ó Conchobhair Falaighe of Offaly – the latter's capital was Daingean – were two self-contained territories that had earned the right to be called kingdoms due to their near-invincibility against successive generations of Anglo-Irish. The great losers were the Ó Melaghlins of Meath: their kingdom collapsed despite attempts by Cormac mac Art O Melaghlain to restore it. The royal family was reduced to vassal status, confined to the east shores of the River Shannon. The kingdom was substantially incorporated into the Lordship of Meath which was granted to Hugh de Lacy in 1172.|$|E

As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We {{did a lot of}} shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like {{to think of it as}} unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

[...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent.

Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> {{is that there is no}} historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{basis for}} King Arthur {{is a source}} of considerable debate among historians.

2500|$|At this point, however, Wagner, it seems, {{began to}} doubt the wisdom of writing an opera on such an obscure subject.

Whatever the reason, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is that having completed the libretto of Siegfried's Tod, Wagner then put the work aside and turned his attention to other matters. Between December 1848 and March 1850, he wrote several influential essays, some of them quite lengthy. He also spent much of this time working out detailed scenarios for several other operas on a variety of historical and mythical figures: Jesus Christ, Achilles, Friedrich Barbarossa and Wieland der Schmied. None of these operas ever saw the light of day, though one musical sketch survives for Jesus von Nazareth.|$|E

Adams traveled to Melbourne, Australia in December 2009 for the World Religions Conference. In an appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program hosted by Tony Eastley, AM, Adams stated, [...] "From one church in 1954 to ... we're in 165 nations now; we have 8,000 churches, missions and groups right across this fair earth of ours." [...] Adams disputed assertions of abuse within Scientology publicized {{on the floor of}} the Australian Senate by Senator Nick Xenophon and commented, [...] "It's not that the allegations aren't serious charges; <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is that they are unsubstantiated rumours. Many of these so-called charges, so-called allegations are very old. I mean, 12 or 15 years ago, these incidents occurred, were thoroughly reviewed." [...] Regarding statements by Senator Xenophon that women within Scientology who became pregnant were pressured into having abortions, Adams said, [...] "That's someone's statement of... it's totally false. There's no proof whatsoever; no one has ever made... no one has come forward and said here's the proof." [...] Adams asserted to The Age that all of the critical statements made by Senator Xenophon about Scientology in the Australian Senate were [...] "meritless". He commented, [...] "One way to measure that is how law enforcement responds to any of these allegations. There has been no interest because there has been no evidence.

2500|$|American Reform, especially, turned {{action for}} social and {{progressive}} causes into {{an important part of}} religious commitment. From {{the second half of the}} 20th Century, it employed the old rabbinic notion of Tikkun Olam, [...] "repairing the world", as a slogan under which constituents were encouraged to partake in various initiatives for the betterment of society. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism became an important lobby in service of progressive causes such as the rights of women, minorities, LGBT and the like. Tikkun Olam has become the central venue for active participation for many affiliates, even leading critics to negatively describe Reform as little more than a means employed by Jewish liberals to claim that commitment to their political convictions was also a religious activity and demonstrates fealty to Judaism. Dana Evan Kaplan stated that [...] "Tikkun Olam has incorporated only leftist, socialist-like elements. In truth, it is political, basically a mirror of the most radically leftist components of the Democratic Party platform, causing many to say that Reform Judaism is simply 'the Democratic Party with Jewish holidays'." [...] Rabbi Jakob Josef Petuchowski complained that under the influence of secular Jews who constitute most of its congregants since the 1950s, when lack of religious affiliation was particularly frowned upon, [...] "Reform Judaism is today in the forefront of secularism in America... Very often indistinguishable from the ACLU... <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is that it has, somewhere along the line, lost its religious moorings." [...] In Israel, the Religious Action Center is very active in the judicial field, often resorting to litigation both in cases concerning civil rights in general and the official status of Reform within the state, in particular.|$|E

It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone {{that this was something}} that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found {{the weapons of mass destruction}} and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ...
