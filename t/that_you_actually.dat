500|$|One of Adams's stated goals {{was to be}} {{experimental}} {{in the use of}} sound. Being a fan of Pink Floyd and the Beatles, {{and especially}} the experimental concept albums both bands produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Adams wanted the programme to have the feel of a [...] "rock album...to convey the idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> were on a spaceship or an alien planet — that sense of a huge aural landscape".|$|E
500|$|... "Zooropa" [...] is set amongst neon {{signs of}} a brightly lit futuristic city. In the song's introduction, {{background}} voices ask, [...] "What do you want?" [...] In response to the question, the lyrics {{in the first three}} verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, [...] "Better by design", [...] "Be all that you can be", and [...] "Vorsprung durch technik". Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to [...] "signify the emptiness of modern, godless life". In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines [...] "I have no compass / And I have no map". [...] "Babyface" [...] is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. [...] "Lemon", inspired by an old video of Bono's late mother in a lemon-coloured dress, describes man's attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, [...] "A man makes a picture / A moving picture / Through the light projected he can see himself up close". The lyrics to [...] "Numb" [...] are a series of [...] "don't" [...] commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, [...] "that sense that you were getting bombarded with so much <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you".|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E

Video game talk show Good Game gave the game a 7 out of 10 which praised that it didn't feel like a Wii sports game and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> had to use your whole body to play it however stating that the soccer felt a bit brain dead.

2500|$|The Washington Posts Allison Stewart {{writes that}} the album [...] "cribs heavily from vintage R. Kelly {{in the same way}} its predecessor,... Love Hate, {{borrowed}} from Purple Rain-era Prince". The track [...] "Kelly's 12 Play" [...] references R. Kelly's 1993 album 12 Play. In an interview for DJBooth, The-Dream discussed his musical approach to the album, stating [...] "This album's gonna be the same thing– a little more beefed up, I'm just gonna give you more. Every album I'm just gonna try to give you more of me, and what I think about certain things... This album is just gonna be the first album on some out of this world crack, basically". In an interview for The Village Voice, he discussed his use of melody, repetition, and hooks, relating it to child discipline, saying that [...] "Americans are not the biggest listeners. I didn't listen, which is why my granddaddy beat me half the time. It's only when the belt is swinging at you in the same repetitive manner <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> start to listen. So it's all about creating a belt on the song that repetitiously swings at you. It doesn't mean that in between the belt swinging, I'm not saying stuff that means something".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Rogers {{teamed up with}} close friend and Country Music legend Dottie West {{for a series of}} albums and duets. Together the duo won 2 gold records (1 of which later went platinum), 2 CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy {{nominations}} and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums [...] "Every Time Two Fools Collide" [...] (#1) and [...] "Classics" [...] (#3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: [...] "She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions." [...] In a 1978 press release for their album [...] "Every Time Two Fools Collide," [...] Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography [...] "Luck Or Something Like It."

6000|$|... 16. I am {{sure that}} all of you must readily {{acknowledge}} the charm which is imparted to any landscape {{by the presence of}} cottages; and you must over and over again have paused at the wicket gate of some cottage garden, delighted by the simple beauty of the honeysuckle porch and latticed window. Has it ever occurred to you to ask the question, what effect the cottage would have upon your feelings if it had no roof? no visible roof, I mean;--if instead of the thatched slope, in which the little upper windows are buried deep, as in a nest of straw--or the rough shelter of its mountain shales--or warm coloring of russet tiles--there were nothing but a flat leaden top to it, making it look like a large packing-case with windows in it? I don't think the rarity of such a sight would make you feel it to be beautiful; on the contrary, if you think over the matter, you will find <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> do owe, and ought to owe, a great part of your pleasure in all cottage scenery, and in all the inexhaustible imagery of literature which is founded upon it, to the conspicuousness of the cottage roof--to the subordination of the cottage itself to its covering, which leaves, in nine cases out of ten, really more roof than anything else. It is, indeed, not so much the whitewashed walls--nor the flowery garden--nor the rude fragments of stones set for steps at the door--nor any other picturesqueness of the building which interest you, so much as the gray bank of its heavy eaves, deep-cushioned with green moss and golden stone-crop. And there is a profound, yet evident, reason for this feeling. The very soul of the cottage--the essence and meaning of it--are in its roof; it is that, mainly, wherein consists its shelter; that, wherein it differs most completely from a cleft in rocks or bower in woods. It is in its thick impenetrable coverlet of close thatch that its whole heart and hospitality are concentrated. Consider the difference, in sound, of the expressions [...] "beneath my roof" [...] and [...] "within my walls,"--consider whether you would be best sheltered, in a shed, with a stout roof sustained on corner posts, or in an inclosure of four walls without a roof at all,--and you will quickly see how important a part of the cottage the roof must always be to the mind {{as well as to the}} eye, and how, from seeing it, the greatest part of our pleasure must continually arise.|$|E
