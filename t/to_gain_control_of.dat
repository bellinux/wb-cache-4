5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast.

This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E
