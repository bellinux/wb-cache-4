40|$|A plasmid {{segregant}} carrying tetracycline and carbenicillin {{resistance markers}} has been isolated from R factor RP 1 by <b>transductional</b> <b>shortening</b> with phage P 22. The new plasmid RP 1 -S 2, {{which has a}} molecular weight of 23 times 10 - 6, has lost the transfer, phage sensitivity, and neomycin resistance functions of RP 1. It combines readily with a W group plasmid, R 388, to form a transmissible carbenicillin and trimethoprim resistance plasmid, RWP 1...|$|E
40|$|F-merogenotes {{derived from}} F 14 by <b>transductional</b> <b>shortening</b> have {{previously}} {{been found to}} consist of the sex factor plus {{one or more of}} the ilv genes. It is shown here that they carry one or more ilv genes and a variable portion of the adjacent proximal ilv gene. This observation was used to develop a method, analogous to deletion mapping, for ordering mutant sites within the ilv genes. This method requires the use of a series of merogenotes each carrying an increasingly longer segment of the gene being mapped. A simplified method of fine-structure mapping is also described which requires only one or two Fâ€² donor strains to map any one gene. This method is based on the large differences observed in recombination frequencies for mutant sites at various distances from the origin of the incomplete merogenote gene. The sequence of 25 mutant sites within three of the ilv genes was determined by use of the simplified procedure...|$|E
40|$|Incompatibility group P {{plasmids}} demonstrate strong entry exclusion properties. Stringent incompatibility is {{also observed}} {{in the absence of}} entry exclusion. These observations have been facilitated by the study of a nontransmissible plasmid, RP 1 -S 2, derived from RP 1 by <b>transductional</b> <b>shortening.</b> RP 1 -S 2 retains carbenicillin and tetracycline resistances as well as loci that cause either the loss of P plasmids (incp) or a locus specifying susceptibility to curing (sinp) {{in the presence of a}} P plasmid. RP 1 -S 2 can be mobilized by an incompatibility group W plasmid, R 388, and also freely forms recombinants with R 388. P, N, and W incompatibility group plasmids all encode information for the receptor of the cell wall-adsorbing phage PRD 1. Based on the premise that the location of this receptor is analogous to entry exclusion factors for F-like plasmids and hence a regulated transfer region determinant, we tested fertility inhibition relationships among these plasmid groups. We detected both reciprocal and nonreciprocal fertility inhibition relationships for bacteria containing various combinations of W, N, and P group plasmids. The nonreciprocal nature of some combinations, we believe, reflects the identity of the point mutation reading to derepression of the plasmid in question. Reciprocal fertility inhibition, on the other hand, may reflect the reconstruction of a fertility inhibition system through complementation. An X incompatibility group plasmid, known to affect the fertility of an N group plasmid, was also shown to inhibit P plasmid fertility. These observations may indicate a possible evolutionary relationship(s) of plasmids unrelated by the criteria of incompatibility, pilus phage specificity, or plasmid host range...|$|E
40|$|A lactose-negative (Lac-), proteinase-negative (Prt-) mutant, {{designated}} C 145 {{was isolated}} from Streptococcus lactis C 2 after treatment with nitrosoguanidine and ultraviolet irradiation. The mutant {{appeared to be}} cured of the prophage(s) present in S. lactis C 2 based on non-inducibility by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C. When cleared lysate material from C 145 was subjected, to cesium chloride-ethidum bromide (EB) density gradient centrifugation, no plasmid peak was observed, suggesting that C 145 was cured of plasmid deoxyribonucleic and (DNA). A histogram showing distribution of contour lengths of circular molecules of DNA from C 145, however, revealed {{the presence of a}} greatly diminished number of DNA molecules as compared with the parent culture and indicated the absence of the 30 x 10 (6) plasmid. Cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradient profiles from Lac+, Prt- and Lac+ Prt+ transductants of C 145 revealed no plasmid peak, but electron microscopy of the fractions normally possessing the satellite band of DNA showed the presence of a new plasmid species having a molecular weight from 20 x 10 (6) to 22 x 10 (6). This plasmid was lost when the transductants became Lac-. Examination of a plasmid histogram from a spontaneous Lac- Prt- mutants of S. lactis C 2 resembled that of C 145, with the absence of the 30 x 10 (6) plasmid and the presence of the 22 x 10 (6) plasmid in Lac+ Prt+ transductants. The results suggest that lactose metabolism is mediated through the 30 x 10 (6) plasmid in S. lactis C 2 and that the transducing bacteriophage, which is too small to accommodate the entire plasmid, is transferring about two-thirds of the original plasmid through a process termed <b>transductional</b> <b>shortening...</b>|$|E
