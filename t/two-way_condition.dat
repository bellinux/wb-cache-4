40|$|Patients with {{schizophrenia}} {{often have}} anxiety and depression, {{and thus are}} treated with multiple psychotherapeutic medications. This practice of polypharmacy increases the possibility for drug–drug interactions. However, the pharmacological and behavioral mechanisms underlying drug–drug interactions in schizophrenia remain poorly understood. In the present study, we adopted a preclinical approach and examined a less known behavioral mechanism, drug–drug conditioning (DDC) between haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic) or olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic) and citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). A rat <b>two-way</b> <b>conditioned</b> avoidance response paradigm {{was used to measure}} antipsychotic activity and determine how DDC may alter the antipsychotic efficacy in this model. Following acquisition of the avoidance response, rats were then randomly assigned to receive vehicle, citalopram (10. 0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), haloperidol (0. 05 mg/kg, subcutaneously), olanzapine (1. 0 mg/kg, subcutaneously), combined haloperidol with citalopram, or combined olanzapine with citalopram treatment for seven avoidance test sessions. In comparison with antipsychotic treatment alone, combined treatment with citalopram potentiated the antiavoidance effect of olanzapine or haloperidol (to a lesser extent) during the seven drug-test sessions. In addition, repeated pairing of citalopram with haloperidol or olanzapine caused citalopram to show a newly acquired avoidance-disruptive effect. This effect was context specific because citalopram paired with haloperidol or olanzapine outside the avoidance testing context (i. e. home cages) did not show such an effect. These findings indicate that concurrent antidepressant and antipsychotic treatments may engender a DDC process that follows the general Pavlovian associative conditioning principles. They also indicate that adjunctive citalopram treatment may enhance the antipsychotic efficacy of haloperidol and olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Rationale — Acute {{antipsychotic}} treatment disrupts conditioned avoidance responding, {{and repeated}} treatment induces a sensitization- or tolerance-like effect. However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying both acute and repeated antipsychotic effects {{remain to be}} determined. Objective — The present study examined the neuroreceptor mechanisms of haloperidol, clozapine, and olanzapine effect in a rat <b>two-way</b> <b>conditioned</b> avoidance model. Methods — Well-trained Sprague–Dawley rats were administered with haloperidol (0. 05 mg/kg, sc), clozapine (10. 0 mg/ kg, sc), or olanzapine (1. 0 mg/kg, sc) together with either saline, quinpirole (a selective dopamine D 2 / 3 agonist, 1. 0 mg/ kg, sc), or 2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodo-amphetamine (DOI; a selective 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C agonist, 2. 5 mg/kg, sc), and their conditioned avoidance responses were tested over 3 days. After 2 days of drug-free retraining, the repeated treatment effect was assessed in a challenge test. Results — Pretreatment of quinpirole, but not DOI, attenuated the acute haloperidol-induced disruption of avoidance responding {{and to a lesser}} extent, olanzapine-induced disruption. In contrast, pretreatment of DOI, but not quinpirole, attenuated the acute effect of clozapine. On the repeated effect, pretreatment of DOI, but not quinpirole, attenuated the potentiated disruption of haloperidol, whereas pretreatment of quinpirole attenuated the potentiated disruption of olanzapine but enhanced the tolerance-like effect of clozapine. Conclusions — These findings suggest that acute haloperidol and olanzapine disrupt avoidance responding primarily by blocking dopamine D 2 receptors, whereas acute clozapine exerts its disruptive effect primarily by blocking the 5 -HT 2 A receptors. The repeated haloperidol effect may be mediated by 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C blockade-initiated neural processes, whereas the repeated clozapine and olanzapine effect may be mediated by D 2 / 3 blockade-initiated neural processes...|$|R

40|$|This report {{develops}} a multicommodity flow model to optimize water distribution {{and water quality}} in a regional water supply system. Waters from different sources with different qualities are considered as distinct commodities, which concurrently share a single water distribution system. Volumetric water blend is used to represent water quality in the model. The model can accommodate two-way flow pipes, represented by undirected arcs, and the perfect mixing condition. Additionally, blending requirements are specified at certain control nodes within the system to ensure that downstream users receive the desired water quality. The optimization model is highly nonlinear and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA). We first use GA to globally search for the directions of all undirected arcs. We then use a generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm, which is embedded in GA, to optimize the objective function for fitness evaluation. The proposed methodology was first tested and verified on a simplified hypothetical system and then applied to the regional water distribution system of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). The results obtained indicate that the optimization model can efficiently allocate waters from different sources with different qualities to satisfy the blending requirements, perfect mixing and <b>two-way</b> flow <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

In the case of land reclamation on soft soil foundations, a variety of non-uniform initial excess pore pressure distributions can be generated during various stages of the land reclamation process, as different loading and placement conditions are encountered. Two examples of land reclamation have been discussed, highlighting the conditions during which linearly increasing and decreasing initial excess pore pressure distributions can be expected to occur.

Technical and economic feasibility of the system were also evaluated. The conveyance loss was 2. 80 to 9. 50 % in PVC and plastic pipe whereas in earthen channel it varied from 30 to 33 % in silty-clay loam soil, which indicates that on an average 83 % water can be saved by improved pipe distribution system. The maximum pressure head in <b>two-way</b> flow <b>condition</b> was 4. 25 m. The total head of DTW developed due to the pipe distribution system was 16. 52 m at the peak irrigation period, which was below the limit of the total head of the DTW and did not create any problem on pump unit. The motor speed varied from 1490 - 1500 rpm in two-way or three-way flow conditions, which did not create any back-pressure on pump.

DesignTwenty subjects with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (OA) and 10 age-matched controls were enrolled. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, including T 1 ρ and T 2 map sequences were performed unloaded and loaded at 50 % body mass. Cartilage masks were segmented semi-automatically on registered high-resolution spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) images for each compartment (medial and lateral). Cartilage lesions were identified using a modified Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) score. Statistical differences were explored using separate <b>two-way</b> (group×loading <b>condition)</b> Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using age as a covariate to {{evaluate the}} effects of loading on T 1 ρ and T 2 relaxation times. ResultsA significant decrease in T 1 ρ (44. 5 ± 3. 8 vs 40. 2 ± 4. 8 ms for unloaded and loaded, respectively; P< 0. 001) and T 2 (31. 8 ± 3. 8 vs 30. 5 ± 4. 8 ms for unloaded and loaded, respectively; P< 0. 001) relaxation times was observed in the medial compartment with loading while no differences were observed in the lateral compartment. This behavior occurred independent of WORMS score. Cartilage compartments with small focal lesions experienced greater T 1 ρ change scores with loading when compared to cartilage without lesions or cartilage with larger defects (P= 0. 05). ConclusionsAcute loading resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} T 1 ρ and T 2 relaxation times of the medial compartment, with greater change scores observed in cartilage regions with small focal lesions.

Female varsity hockey players (n = 12) performed two skating tests on a TM with and without a mouthguard (WIPSS Jaw-Joint Protecto(TM)). The players wore the mouthguard during hockey practices prior to collection of ventilation data on the treadmill. Also, the players completed a questionnaire that examined their perceptions of the mouthguard in terms of ventilation, comfort and performance. A 10 -point rating scale was used for this evaluation. Two performance tests on the skating treadmill examined the effect of the mouthguard on submaximal and maximal aerobic exercise. The subjects skated for 4 min at 2 submaximal velocities (14 and 16 km·h- 1) separated by 5 min of passive recovery. A VO 2 max test followed the submaximal tests and commenced at 18 km·h- 1 with the velocity increasing by 1 km·h- 1 every minute until volitional fatigue.

40|$|When solvinglinear {{scattering}} problems, one typically first solves for the imping-ing wave in {{the absence}} of obstacles. Then, using the linear superposition principle, the original problem is reduced to one which involves only the scattered wave (which is driven by the values of the impinging field at the surface of the obstacles). When the original domain is unbounded, special artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) have to be set at the outer (artificial) boundary of the finite computational domain in order to guarantee the reflectionless propagation of waves through this external artificial boundary. The situation becomes conceptually different when the propagation equa-tion is nonlinear. In this case the impinging and scattered waves can no longer be separated, and the problem has to be solved in its entirety. In particular, the boundary on which the incoming field values are prescribed should transmit the given incoming waves in one direction and simultaneously be transparent to all the outgoing waves that travel in the opposite direction.

The Media Naturalness Theory explains the degree of medium naturalness by comparing its characteristics to face-to-face communication, considered to be the most natural form of communication. A total of 76 participants were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: face-to-face, one-way and <b>two-way</b> videoconferencing.

Regarding the impact of personality, neurotic students tended to enjoy and succeed more in face-to-face learning, whereas emotionally stable students enjoyed and succeeded in all of the learning conditions. Extroverts tended to enjoy more natural learning environments but had lower achievements in these conditions.

Objective: To investigate the effect of a single session of low-volume HIIE on ambulatory BP in normotensive subjects. Methods: Twenty-one normotensive males (23. 6 ± 3. 6 years, 23. 5 ± 2. 3 kg/m 2, resting PA 111. 1 ± 6. 4 / 62. 4 ± 6. 1 mmHg) performed: (i) maximum incremental test; (ii) HIIE and control sessions in a randomized order. The HIIE consisted of 10 x 60 s at 100 % of maximal velocity interspersed by 60 s of passive recovery. The paired sample t-test was used to compare systolic and diastolic BP between control and HIIE sessions. A <b>two-way</b> ANOVA (<b>condition</b> vs. time) was used to compare the ambulatory BP response hour to hour following the control and HIIE sessions. Results: Systolic BP in the 20 -hour analysis reduced 2. 8 ± 3. 7 mmHg and diastolic BP reduced 1. 7 ± 3. 5 mmHg after the HIIE session compared to the control session (p 0. 05). The two-way ANOVA demonstrated that systolic BP was lower in the first five hours after the HIIE session compared to the control session [minimum delta: - 3. 2 mmHg; maximum delta: - 4. 8 mmHg (p 0, 05).

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{computational}} methodology for solving the scalar nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH) that governs {{the propagation of}} laser light in Kerr dielectrics. The methodology addresses two well-known challenges in nonlinear optics: Singular behavior of solutions when the scattering in the medium is assumed predominantly forward (paraxial regime), {{and the presence of}} discontinuities in the % linear and nonlinear optical properties of the medium. Specifically, we consider a slab of nonlinear material which may be grated in the direction of propagation and which is immersed in a linear medium as a whole. The key components of the methodology are a semi-compact high-order finite-difference scheme that maintains accuracy across the discontinuities and enables sub-wavelength resolution on large domains at a tolerable cost, a nonlocal <b>two-way</b> artificial boundary <b>condition</b> (ABC) that simultaneously facilitates the reflectionless propagation of the outgoing waves and forward propagation of the given incoming waves, and a nonlinear solver based on Newton's method.

A key element of the algorithm was a new nonlocal <b>two-way</b> artificial boundary <b>condition</b> (ABC), set {{in the direction of}} beam propagation. This two-way ABC provided for reflectionless propagation of the outgoing waves while also fully transmitting the given incoming beam at the boundaries of the computational domain.

To the best of our knowledge, this capacity has never been achieved previously in nonlinear optics. In the current paper, we propose an improved version of the algorithm. The principal innovation is that instead of using the Dirichlet boundary conditions in the direction orthogonal to that of the laser beam propagation, we now introduce Sommerfeld-type local radiation boundary conditions, which are constructed directly in the discrete framework. Numerically, implementation of the Sommerfeld conditions requires evaluation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a non-Hermitian matrix.

40|$|A {{series of}} five {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine if musical sound had a different effect than non-musical sound on the germination of zucchini and okra seeds when compared to a control. Musical sound {{for this study was}} a collection of improvised works performed by R. Carlos Nakai and Paul Horn. Predominant instrumentation was different types of flute with some selections for soprano saxophone or bass voice. Non-musical sound was "pink" noise used to test loudspeakers. The first three experiments compared musical sound to a control. The last two experiments compared musical sound to non-musical sound to a control. The number of seeds that had sprouted was counted every 12 hours over a 72 -hour time span. Data from the germination of 3, 600 seeds over a total of 14 runs for the five experiments were examined using five-way analyses of variance of mixed design. The main effect for musical sound versus control over all five experiments was highly significant (p < 0. 002). Positional location, temperature and seed type were shown not to be factors. Over the eight runs of the last two experiments (2, 400 seeds) there were no significant interactions between non-musical sound and control. The <b>two-way</b> interaction between <b>condition</b> and time for the three conditions of musical sound, non-musical sound and control was statistically significant (p < 0. 03) indicating that the musical sound used for this study had a greater effect than the non-musical sound. These results imply that effects of musical sound extend beyond the psychological and suggest the possibility that musical sound can have physiological effects on biological systems...|$|R
40|$|When solving linear {{scattering}} problems, one typically #rst solves for the impinging wave in {{the absence}} of obstacles. Then, using the linear superposition principle, the original problem is reduced to one whichinvolves only the scattered wave #which is driven by the values of the impinging #eld at the surface of the obstacles#. When the original domain is unbounded, special arti#cial boundary conditions #ABCs# have to be set at the outer #arti#cial# boundary of the #nite computational domain, in order to guarantee the re#ectionless propagation of waves through this external arti#cial boundary. The situation becomes conceptually di#erent when the propagation equation is nonlinear. In this case the impinging and scattered waves can no longer be separated, and the problem has to be solved in its entirety. In particular, the boundary on which the incoming #eld values are prescribed, should transmit the given incoming waves in one direction and simultaneously be transparent to all the outgoing waves that travel in the opposite direction. We call this type of boundary <b>conditions</b> <b>two-way</b> ABCs. In the paper, we construct the two-way ABCs for the nonlinear Helmholtz equation, which models a continuous-wave #CW# laser beam propagation in a medium with nonlinear index of refraction. In this case, the forward propagation of the beam is accompanied by backscattering, i. e., generation of waves in the opposite direction to that of the incoming signal. Our twoway ABCs generate no re#ection of the backscattered waves {{and at the same time}} impose the correct values of the incoming wave. The ABCs are obtained in the framework of a fourth-order accurate discretization to the Helmholtz operator inside the computational domain. The fourth-order convergence of our methodology is corroborate [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed clipless pedals with medio-lateral rotational capabilities {{have been associated}} with claims of enhanced cycling biomechanics. The purose {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of freedom of movement of the foot on lower extremity frontal plane movement as measured by tibial tuberosity patterns and to relate these to sagittal plane leg motion. Four recreational and four competitive cyclists rode a stationary bicycle at 90 rpm under a constant workload using adjustable pedals. Five pedal conditions were tested (A: no motion, B: ± 3 °, C: ± 5 °, D: - 1 ° to + 5 ° and E: _ 5 ° to + 1 ° of motion). Subjects were videotaped in the frontal and sagittal planes simultaneously. The video records were analyzed using a Peak Performance video analysis system. Ten continuous crank revolutions were sampled for each condition; averages of maximum medial positions, lateral positions, medial/lateral range, and standard deviation of range were calculated. A <b>two-way</b> ANOVA (pedal <b>condition</b> and experience) was used to compare mean values of each variable. No significant differences in average maximum positions, ranges, or variability were found for the five pedal conditions (p 3 ̆e. 10). Recreational cyclists were found to display significantly larger average maximum medial/lateral ranges when compared to competitive cyclists (p=. 06). Mean maximum medial/lateral range was 2. 2 cm for all data and 1. 9 and 2. 6 cm for competitive and recreational groups, respectively. Subjects ranged from 1. 3 to 4. 0 cm of medial/lateral movement. Maximum medial/lateral x-coordinate positions occurred at similar degrees of crank and knee angle across conditions for a given subject but were different between subjects. Clipless pedal systems did not significantly change frontal plane leg kinematics during stationary cycling in the population studied. The observed motions were individually characteristic and were dependent on cycling experience...|$|R
40|$|During dynamic {{fast paced}} sports, such as netball, volleyball and {{basketball}} {{the body is}} exposed to high ground reaction forces (GRF), contributing to lower body injury occurrence during landing. A certain amount of conditioning and/or technique training to effectively mitigate injury risk and improve performance is particularly important amongst a female population. Therefore the initial aim of this thesis was to systematically review the literature on jump-landing progressions. This incorporated an in-depth discussion of the prerequisite factors which were thought critical when progressing jump-landing stimuli during training. Following the review of literature a systematic model aimed at progressing jump-landing proficiency was presented, which targeted training components for effective program implementation. This model addressed the issues of incorrect landing technique, insufficient muscular strength and lack of balance and neuromuscular control. Each of these concerns are integrated into specific phases and training components aimed at progressively overloading the subject during landing. Understanding {{the magnitude of the}} GRF associated with various jump-landing patterns was the aim for the final part of this thesis. Presented as a cross sectional experimental study, this section quantified the GRFs experienced during progressive drop-landing tasks. This study informed the exercise prescription for Phase 2 of the training model developed in the previous chapter. Twenty-one netball players from the National Talent Development squad volunteered to participate in a study to quantify the vertical (VGRF), horizontal (HGRF) and lateral (LGRF) GRFs when jump height and distance were systematically increased across bilateral and unilateral landings. Three different heights (15, 30 and 45 cm), distances (40, 80 and 120 cm) and landing strategies (bilateral forward, unilateral forward and unilateral lateral) were used to create 27 jump-landing <b>conditions.</b> <b>Two-way</b> analysis of variance was used to analyse the effects of drop height and jumping distance for each landing strategy. It would appear that increasing height and distance significantly increased VGRF (mean = 18. 1 %) for all landing strategies. HGRF was more dependent on changes in height for forward landings, while increases in both drop height and/or jump distance were shown to be effective methods of increasing LGRF (mean = 36. 2 %) for single leg landings. These results can be used to systematically overload jump-landing exercises, which may therefore enhance training prescription to improve performance and decrease injury...|$|R
40|$|Librarians {{and library}} binders {{are no longer}} always able to specify the traditional, {{superior}} oversewing method for binding library books. This problem emerged due to economic pressures within several related industries resulting in a proliferation of economic, but often inferior, binding technologies. As libraries are only approximately ten to fifteen percent of total publishers 2 ̆ 7 sales, books cannot specifically {{be made for the}} library market. In addition, many of the new binding technologies yield books with insufficient inner margin space to prebind or rebind books utilizing the oversewing binding method. And finally, librarians, also faced with tight budgets, must find economic ways to bind library books. This study concentrated on investigating and determining the merits of two alternate binding methods PVA double fanning and cleat-lacing and quantitatively comparing them with oversewing. The binding performance comparison tests were for both openability and strength (internal) properties, two main concerns for the rigors of library use. It was hypothesized that 1) all three binding methods would yield different openability and binding strengths as the methods of fastening pages together work on different principles, 2) the strengths would be significantly influenced by two more main factors, paper and condition, and 3) the interactions of these three main factors (binding method, paper, condition) could significantly vary binding strength. Three different papers were tested: uncoated, dull, and glossy. The three conditions were new, used, and aged. Twenty-seven combinations of books were bound according to Class A, LBI Standard, specifications (except method of affixing pages) for testing. A new precise method of measuring openability was devised for this study called 2 ̆ 2 Openability Photocopy Test. 2 ̆ 2 The results, in general, proved that the PVA double fanned books opened better than both the cleat-laced and oversewn books, across all papers tested. The cleat-laced books opened slightly better than the oversewn volumes. Both oversewn and cleat-laced books were more consistent for openability than the PVA double fanned, across all papers. The Martini Page Pull and Flex Tester was used to determine binding strengths by recording the force necessary (pounds per linear inch) to pull single pages out of a binding. The strength test results were analyzed by the statistical method called 2 ̆ 2 analysis of variance. 2 ̆ 2 It was found that the critical (statistically significant) factors were the two main factors of binding method and paper but not condition. And it was further determined that the two-way interactions of paper/binding method, paper/condition, and binding method/condition also all vary the binding strengths significantly. The three-way multiple interaction effect, paper/binding method/condition, was not significant. All book combinations tested yielded binding strengths which exceeded 4. 0 lbs/in, a rating of 2 ̆ 2 Excellent 2 ̆ 2 by the Library Binding Institute. However, there was great variability above this level (a range of 4. 26 to 8. 50 lbs/in). In general, the PVA double fanned bindings had the greatest strengths, oversewn second best, and cleat-laced books had the lowest scores. Uncoated paper yielded books with the greatest strengths, dull paper second, and glossy paper gave the least binding strengths. Particular combinations of paper, binding method, and <b>condition</b> (<b>two-way</b> interactions) caused variations in binding strengths so the general conclusions did not always hold true. The results of the openability and strength tests were graphed and categorized in data tables. These graphs and tables can be used as an Optimum Binding Method Index for openability and strength for books of the dimensions and qualities set forth in this study. Librarians and library binders may now make more informed decisions in selecting a proper alternate binding method for a book, cleat-lacing or PVA double fanning...|$|R
40|$|Objetivo: analisar a influÃncia do uso de inibidores de metaloproteinases da matriz [epigalocatequina- 3 -galato (EGCG) e digluconato de clorexidina (CHX) ] utilizados como prÃ-tratamento dentinÃrio sobre a resistÃncia de uniÃo de um sistema adesivo autocondicionante em dentina hÃgida (H) e erosivamente desmineralizada (ED). Materiais e MÃtodos: terceiros molares humanos hÃgidos extraÃdos tiveram o terÃo oclusal seccionado, expondo a superfÃcie dentinÃria subjacente ao esmalte. A microdureza de superfÃcie (Knoop) da dentina exposta foi usada como parÃmetro para a seleÃÃo de 36 dentes, que foram aleatoriamente distribuÃdos em 6 grupos experimentais, de acordo com o tipo de dentina e com o prÃ-tratamento empregado (n= 6) : HAD (HÃgida + Ãgua destilada); HCHX (HÃgida + CHX a 2 %); HEGCG (HÃgida + EGCG a 0, 1 %); EDAD (Erosivamente desmineralizada + Ãgua destilada); EDCHX (Erosivamente desmineralizada + CHX a 2 %); EDEGCG (Erosivamente desmineralizada + EGCG a 0, 1 %). Todos os grupos foram submetidos Ã formaÃÃo de uma pelÃcula adquirida com saliva humana e, em seguida, os dentes dos grupos EDAD, EDCHX e EDEGCG foram submetidos a um ciclo erosivo (Ãcido cÃtrico 1 %, pH 3, 75; 3 x/dia por 5 dias), enquanto que nos grupos HAD, HCHX e HEGCG, a soluÃÃo Ãcida foi substituÃda por Ãgua destilada. No perÃodo entre os ciclos, os espÃcimes foram armazenados em saliva {{artificial}} durante 2 h. ApÃs os ciclos, as superfÃcies dentinÃrias (hÃgidas e erosivamente desmineralizadas) foram prÃ-tratadas com 15 &# 956;L da soluÃÃo, ativamente, por 60 s e, posteriormente, o sistema adesivo Clearfil SE BondÂ (CSEB) foi aplicado e um platÃ de 4 mm de resina composta Filtek Z 250 Â foi construÃdo. ApÃs estocagem em Ãgua destilada a 37 ÂC por 24 h, os dentes foram cortados em forma de palitos, os quais foram submetidos a um ensaio mecÃnico de microtraÃÃo Ã velocidade de 0, 5 mm/min. Resultados: os valores de resistÃncia de uniÃo (MPa) foram estatisticamente avaliados por ANOVA a dois critÃrios (condiÃÃo da dentina e prÃ-tratamento) e teste de Bonferroni (entre grupos), com nÃvel de significÃncia de 5 %. Os grupos tratados com CHX apresentaram valores de resistÃncia de uniÃo estatisticamente inferiores (p 0, 05). ConclusÃo: o uso de CHX influenciou negativamente, enquanto o uso de EGCG nÃo influenciou a resistÃncia de uniÃo do sistema adesivo CSEB Ã dentina hÃgida (H) e erosivamente desmineralizada (ED). Objective: {{to analyze}} {{the influence of the}} use of two matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors [epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) and chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) ] as pretreatment solutions on dentin bond strength of a self-etch adhesive system on sound (H) and erosively demineralized dentin (ED). Materials and Methods: intact human third molars were sectioned on the occlusal third, exposing the underlying dentin surface. The surface hardness (Knoop) from exposed dentin was used as a parameter for the selection of 36 teeth that were randomly divided into 6 experimental groups according to the type and dentin pretreatment employed (n= 6) : HAD (sound + distilled water); HCHX (sound + 2 % CHX); HEGCG (sound + 0, 1 % EGCG); EDAD (erosively demineralized + distilled water); EDCHX (erosively demineralized + 2 % CHX); EDEGCG (erosively demineralized + 0, 1 % EGCG). All groups were subjected to an acquired pellicle formation with human saliva and then, teeth from EDDW, EDCHX and EDEGCG groups were subjected to an erosion cycle (1 % citric acid, pH 3. 75, 3 3 x/day, during 5 days), whereas in the groups HAD, HCHX and HEGCG the acid solution was replaced by distilled water. Between the cycles, specimens were stored in artificial saliva for 2 h. After the cycles, dentin surfaces (sound and erosively demineralized) were pretreated with 15 &# 956;L of the solution, actively, for 60 s and than Clearfil SE BondÂ (CSEB) was applied and a 4 mm resin build up was made with composite resin Filtek Z 250 Â.
