2500|$|The Corsa was {{developed}} {{directly from the}} MC12 GT1, which won the 2005 FIA GT Manufacturers Cup.

2500|$|Paranormal {{researcher}} John Champion {{writes in}} Skeptical Inquirer Magazine {{that he understands}} why people persist in believing that Queen Mary is haunted when the only evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows. Tourists who {{sign up for the}} haunted tour are given access to normally off-limit areas of the ship, while tours {{of the history of the}} ship are more limited. Champion believes that <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>are</b> doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such. The confusion of science and history with fiction ... gets us further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history." ...|$|E

Why, I dined with a friend in St. James's Street. Lord Treasurer, I am told, was abroad to-day; I will know to-morrow how he does after it. The Duke of Marlborough is come, and was yesterday at Hampton Court with the Queen; no, it was t'other day; no, it was yesterday; for to-day I remember Mr. Secretary was going to see him, when I was there, not at the Duke of Marlborough's, but at the Secretary's; the Duke is not so fond of me.

"Well, Mr. Prendergast, I am {{against these}} new-fangled steamboats--I suppose every true sailor is; {{but when the}} Marjory began to run between London and Gravesend {{eighteen}} years ago--in '15 I think it was--folks did say {{that it would not}} be long before sailing craft would be driven off the sea. I did not believe that then, and I don't believe it now; but I do say that I hope before long there will be a lot of small steamers on the Thames, to tow vessels down till they are off the North Foreland. It would be a blessing and a comfort to us master mariners. Once there we have the choice of going outside the Goodwins, or taking a short cut inside if the wind is aft. Why, sir, it would add years to our lives and shorten voyages by weeks. There we are, now, sometimes lying off the Nore, five hundred sail, waiting for the wind to shift out of the east, and when we do get under weigh we have always to keep the lead going. One never knows when one may bump upon the sands. Some masters will grope their way along in the dark, but for my part I always anchor. There are few enough buoys and beacons in daytime, but I consider that it is tempting Providence to try and go down in a dark night. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> <b>are</b> sensible men and they know that it is not worth while running risks just to save a day or two when you have got a four months' voyage before you. Once past Dover I am ready to hold on with anyone, but between the Nore and the North Foreland I pick my way as carefully as a woman going across a muddy street." ...|$|E
