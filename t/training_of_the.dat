5|$|On 16 September, the Allies {{commenced}} a 232 gun and 24 howitzer artillery barrage on the Bulgarian positions between Vardar and Doiran. Bulgaria {{responded in}} kind, with the artillery duel continuing {{during the following}} two days. On the night of 17–18 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells, however the attack failed to produce any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders.|$|E

5|$|With {{their loss}} to Auburn, Alabama {{completed}} the first winless season in Alabama football history, {{and since then}} they have had only two other winless seasons in 1895 and 1955. The losses of 1893 were attributed to the small stature of the Crimson players {{and not to the}} coaching and <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team. As such, Abbott returned as head coach for the 1894 season and led Alabama to a winning season that included their first all-time win over Auburn.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely {{unattended}} for the following twenty years. During this period of inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were most of the other major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships' crews.|$|E

5|$|Andronicus II {{took a deep}} {{interest}} in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army. The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General Alexios Philanthropenos to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son Michael IX and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at Magnesia and Bapheus in 1302.|$|E
5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5|$|Carrying a S.H.I.E.L.D. 'asset' between {{classified}} bases, {{a convoy}} is {{attacked by a}} seemingly invisible force, with the vehicles being hurled impossibly into the air.

Aboard the Bus, the aerial headquarters for S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson and his team, Agent Grant Ward is struggling to supervise the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unmotivated civilian-recruit Skye. Learning of Hall's kidnapping, Coulson and his team investigate the convoy wreckage. Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a device, fueled by the rare element gravitonium, that alters gravity fields.

5|$|Drakri Hermitage (brag ri ri khrod), {{also known}} as Bari Hermitage (sba ri ri khrod) lies about three {{kilometres}} north and slightly east of downtown Lhasa. Drakri, {{believed to have been}} founded by the abbot of Pha bong kh in the 18th century, was used as a meditational retreat by Klong rdol bla ma ngag dbang blo bzang (1719–1794), one of the most renowned scholars of the Lhopa Regional House (Lho pa khang tshan) of the Jé College (Grwa tshang byes). Drakri Hermitage had control over Garu Nunnery since its early history and supervised the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garu nuns until 1959. In 1959, the monks of the hermitage were evicted and the hermitage was turned into the notorious Drapchi Prison, which gained a reputation for being one of the most severe penal institutions run by the Chinese in Tibet.|$|E
5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battalion, as the unit was short of men {{who were able to}} serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ceremonies, Ohio proceeded to New York, where she was based for the following four years. This time was spent conducting normal peacetime training with the fleet and assisting in the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Naval Militia. By 1914, the worsening conditions during the Mexican Civil War prompted the United States to begin intervening in the conflict. Ohio was sent to Mexican waters early that year to protect American interests in the country. In mid-1914, she returned to the east coast of the United States to conduct a training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. After completing the cruise, Ohio was transferred to the Reserve Fleet based at Philadelphia. She returned to service only to conduct additional midshipmen cruises in the summers of 1915 and 1916.|$|E

5|$|In late 1990 {{consideration}} {{was given}} to deploying a squadron of F/A-18s to the Middle East {{as part of an}} expanded Australian contribution to the Gulf War. The Department of Defence opposed dispatching the aircraft on the grounds that doing so would greatly strain the fighter force in Australia, and this option was not adopted by the government. As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent to the Gulf by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, when there were fears of a German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish volunteers, who would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons of explosives were hidden in caches in case the area came under German occupation.
