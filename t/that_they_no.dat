5|$|A. Bjarne Riis has {{admitted}} to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The {{organizers of the}} Tour de France have stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer consider {{him to be the}} winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status due to the amount of time passed since his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At {{the time}} of his sudden death after 34 years at the helm of Analog, Campbell's quirky {{personality}} and eccentric editorial demands had alienated a number of his most illustrious writers to the point <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer submitted works to him.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Infantry Division Murska and Detachment Ormozki {{were cut}} off north of Zagreb, and those {{elements}} that did not disperse to their homes withdrew into the Ivanšćica and Kalnik mountains. Leaders of a Slovene nationalist movement announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer recognised the Yugoslav government, and began to call for Slovene soldiers to cease fighting and return home, compounding the effect of Ustaše propaganda on Croat military personnel and accelerating the disintegration of Yugoslav forces.|$|E

5|$|The third disc from Integral was {{released}} as a stand-alone game in North America {{under the title}} of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions on September 23, 1999.

5|$|Thorkildsen's {{relationship}} with the Norwegian hurdler Christina Vukicevic generated some unwanted publicity on his part. When Thorkildsen and Vukicevic won the King's Cup {{for men and women}} respectively at the 2006 Norwegian championships, Thorkildsen left the stadium to avoid photographers, whom he had shown the finger the previous day. In March 2011 Vukicevic and Thorkildsen announced in the Norwegian media <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer were a couple.|$|E
5|$|To {{reestablish}} their {{supply lines}} and retake {{the towns of}} Bardaï, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also {{through the use of}} napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.|$|E

5|$|Luther {{also had}} {{experience}} with the indulgences connected to All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences {{and the way they}} cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the Ninety-five Theses. He composed a Treatise on Indulgences, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.|$|E
5|$|The online {{functions}} {{planned for}} Nine {{were intended to}} be incorporated from release, but in August 2002, Atlus announced that they would divide the game in two parts: one stand-alone offline version, and one online version. The reason given for this was that the development team {{did not have enough}} time to integrate all online functions they wanted to include in the game, and that Atlus did not want to delay the game's release. Atlus planned to release the online version in 2002, but put development on hold due to the high costs of developing an online game, and postponed the release until 2003. In August 2003, they announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer had any plans to publish the online version for Xbox, due to problems relating to network-based development and the profitability of online games. With the cancellation of the Xbox Live version, development continued on a version of Nine for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PCs). This version formed the base for what would become , a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for PCs developed by Cave and released in Japan and Western regions across 2007 and 2009.|$|E

25|$|A study {{investigating}} {{sensory integration}} {{within a single}} modality (vision) found that it cannot be established until age 12 and above. This particular study assessed the integration of disparity and texture cues to resolve surface slant. Though younger age groups showed a somewhat better performance when combining disparity and texture cues compared to using only disparity or texture cues, this difference was not statistically significant. In adults, the sensory integration can be mandatory, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer {{have access to the}} individual sensory sources.|$|E
25|$|In Seascape, Nancy and Charlie, an American {{couple on}} the verge of the major life change of retirement, are having {{problems}} in their relationship. They are discussing these matters on the beach when another couple appears, two human-sized lizards named Leslie and Sarah who speak and act like people. The lizards have evolved to such a degree <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer feel at home in the sea and are compelled to seek life on the land. What the lizards experience with Nancy and Charlie nearly drives them back to the sea, but with an offer of help from the human couple, they decide to stay.|$|E
25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E
