40|$|This {{paper is}} about how {{entrepreneurial}} landscapes change over time through the survival, growth and innovative activities of high-tech firms. It explores how the Oxfordshire high-tech economy has evolved over time. It takes as its benchmark the 1980 s, when the first study of Oxfordshire's high-tech economy was undertaken (Lawton Smith 1990). The literature of the 1980 s, the period at which our analysis begins, was concerned with techno-economic changes (Freeman and Perez 1988) associated with the fifth Kondratieff wave, in which entrepreneurship was a key component. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>emphasized</b> the reduced importance of scale economies, emergence of new industries with new organizational forms associated niches for small firms, and limited consolidation (Radosevic 2007). The paper will report on a follow-up to the first Oxfordshire study. It revisits the 182 companies identified as 'advanced technology' i. e. firms that undertake R&D {{in one or more}} of science, computer science and engineering. It will present a breakdown on survival and growth, by sector, by origin of firm e. g. university spin-offs, and by patent and licensing data as indicators of innovation and technological advance. It will thereby provide evidence on the size distribution of surviving firms (and where possible on ones that have ceased trading), markets that firms operate in (niche or mainstream) and the extent of consolidation through merger and acquisition. The study will therefore provide an understanding of processes of change, and where particular locations fit into broader systems of entrepreneurship and innovation...|$|E

We found that recognition was best for French, irrespective of speaking style, and second best for Spanish. Brazilian Portuguese was recognized at above pure chance, unlike European Portuguese.

A {{better understanding of the}} mechanisms driving primary production has potentially important implications for the understanding of the biological carbon pump, as it has for prediction of the system in climate change scenarios. However the scientific discussion regarding this topic has generally failed to integrate the different drivers into a coherent picture, often rendering the proposed mechanisms exclusive to each other. We feel that the suggested mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. Thus, moving beyond the 'single mechanism' point of view, here we present an integrated conceptual model of the physical and biological controls on phytoplankton dynamics in the North Atlantic. Further we believe that the acclimation of physiological rates can {{play an important role in}} mediating phytoplankton dynamics.

40|$|Regenerative failure {{remains a}} {{significant}} barrier for functional recovery after {{central nervous system}} injury. As such, understanding the physiological processes that regulate axon regeneration is a central focus of regenerative medicine. Studying the gene transcription responses to axon injury of regeneration competent neurons, {{such as those of}} the peripheral nervous system, has provided insight into the genes associated with regeneration. Though several individual regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) have been identified from these studies, the response to injury likely regulates the expression of functionally coordinated and complementary gene groups. For instance, successful regeneration would require the induction of genes that drive the intrinsic growth capacity of neurons, while simultaneously downregulating the genes that convey environmental inhibitory cues. Thus, <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the transcriptional regulation of gene programs that contribute to the overall goal of axonal regeneration.

Four empirical findings that helped to prompt this change in theory are analyzed: (a) Intermodal coordination—newborns operate with multimodal information, recognizing equivalences in information across sensory-modalities; (b) Imitation—newborns imitate the lip and tongue movements they see others perform; (c) Memory—young infants form long-lasting representations of perceived events and use these memories to generate motor productions after lengthy delays in novel contexts; (d) Theory of mind—by 18 months of age toddlers have adopted a theory of mind, reading below surface behavior to the goals and intentions in people’s actions.

40|$|Judgments {{of value}} {{are based on}} an {{appreciation}} of the relations among an object’s features (Mandler 1982). They are complex assessments of fit—namely, the fit between the configuration of a product’s features and the configuration of features specified by the schemas used for its interpretation (Mandler 1982). 1 Arguably, individual variations in the use of available schemas can generate differences in individual perceptions of value, but in the aggregate the perceived value of a product depends on its fit with collectively held schemas such as product categories. It {{is important to note that}} the assessment of fit, and the perception of value arising from it, is based on comparing the entire configuration of product features with the configuration of features specified by the schemas. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> of perceptions of value departs from extant models in strategy and marketing that treat customer perceptions of value as based on feature-by-feature product comparisons (Adner 2002; Engel and Blackwell 1982; Griffith 1999).

Participants were 1, 339 injection drug users recruited into the AIDS Link to Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study in Baltimore, Maryland, through community outreach efforts. The study was initiated in 1988, and follow-up continued through 2000, with semiannual visits. Patterns of self-reported drug injection (yes/no) were defined for each participant, based on the number of drug-use transitions. The effect of baseline factors was assessed using multinomial logistic regression models. Over the 12 -year study period, four patterns were noted: 29 % of participants remained persistent drug injectors, 20 % ceased injection, 14 % relapsed once, and 37 % had multiple transitions. Persistent injectors had the shortest follow-up and the highest mortality. For persons who changed their behavior, 3. 4 years elapsed before their first cessation attempt, on average. Factors differentiating the groups included history of incarceration, young age, participation in drug treatment programs, recent overdose, and commercial sex. The observed long-term injection patterns are consistent with the view of drug addiction as a chronic disease. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the need for prolonged efforts to sustain cessation and to prevent adverse health and social outcomes among injection drug users. behavior; HIV; longitudinal studies; recurrence; substance abuse, intravenou...|$|R
40|$|The {{generally}} accepted view that mutualisms represent reciprocal exploitations implies {{a greater or}} lesser degree of inherent tension between the partners. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the importance of identifying conflicts of interest between the partners, and then attempting to quantify the effects of factors that influence costs and benefits to each. The natural history of the speciose fig-fig wasp pollination mutualisms permits such measurements. However, previous attempts to document the presumed tensions, which are expected to result in a negative relationship between the production of viable seeds and pollinator wasp offspring, have met with mixed results, casting doubt on the existence of the conflict. Here, we present hierarchical analyses of 929 fruits sampled from 30 crops representing nine species of monoecious New World figs. These analyses control for the confounding influences of variation in (1) pollination intensity (numbers of foundress pollinators); (2) flower number per fruit; and (3) the proportion of those flowers that develop, on seed and wasp production, both among and within crops. We thereby show that a negative relationship between the production of viable seeds and wasps is, in fact, ubiquitous, thus documenting this underlying tension inherent in the mutualism. We suggest that complex interactions of variables that influence costs and benefits are likely to be a general property of most mutualistic systems. <br...|$|R

40|$|New {{structural}} {{data from the}} Red Sea Hills, northeast Sudan, add constraints to accretionary tectonic processes that acted in the Arabian-Nubian shield during the late Proterozoic. Geometric constraints provided by field data are used together with Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to interpret the regional distribution and structural relations of spectrally and lithologically distinctive rock assemblages. In contrast to interpretations reported elsewhere, these studies indicate that the Hamisana zone, a prominent structural feature in the northern Red Sea Hills, post-dated terrane accretion. It is characterized by east-west crustal shortening and by steep folds and thrust faults. Calc-alkaline magmatism was contemporaneous with and outlasted main phase deformation, thus deformation occurred in an intra-arc setting. Thrust faults were reactivated after east-west contraction, compromising their usefulness in delineating 2 ̆ 7 sutures 2 ̆ 7 or as piercing points across older faults. Pan-African accretionary processes may have been analogous to Phanerozoic ophiolite and island arc accretion in the western North American Cordillera, where penetrative deformation occurred in response to periodic intra-plate shortening events rather than an ultimate collision of unrelated crustal fragments. Such an analogy implies a mechanism for crustal thickening by structural as well as igneous processes during evolution of an accretionary belt in a long-lived convergent margin setting, consistent with the long-standing observation that Pan-African magmatism became more evolved with time. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that an interplay of deformation and magmatism resulted in protracted accretion and crustal thickening, in contrast to models where crustal shortening results directly from collision of a volcanic arc, microcontinent, or other buoyant features...|$|R
