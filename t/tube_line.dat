5|$|On 26 November 1897, {{details of}} a bill {{proposed}} for the 1898 parliamentary session were published by the New Cross and Waterloo Railway (NC), an independent company promoted by James Heath MP, which planned two separate sections of <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> that would connect directly to the BS, extending the line south-east from Waterloo and east from around Marylebone Road.|$|E
5|$|Also {{announced}} in November 1896 was {{a bill to}} be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in cut and cover tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B, the DR's deep <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> would be operated with electric trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} C {{extension}} {{had been completed}} in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called {{for the improvement of}} services at the GNR's Finsbury Park station where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to parliament, and, in 1925, the government called a public inquiry to review options. Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to Southgate. Opposition from the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GNR following the 1923 grouping of railway companies) was again considerable and based on claims that the new Underground line would take passengers from the mainline services. Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. Parliamentary approval was granted in 1930 to extend the Piccadilly tube north beyond Southgate to a terminus at Cockfosters. The approval also included complementary extensions of the Piccadilly tube from its western terminus at Hammersmith to supplement District Railway services to Hounslow and South Harrow. The development was again financed with government backed loans, this time through the 1929 Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act. To ensure the most efficient integration between the new <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> and the UERL's bus and tram operations, the stations were located further apart than in central areas and where road transport services could be arranged to deliver and collect the most passengers. At Manor House, the station was designed with subway exits directly on to pedestrian islands in the road served by the local trams.|$|E
25|$|By 2010, <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> {{was behind}} {{schedule}} on the Jubilee line upgrade and after conflict arose over costs of future {{work in that}} year's PPP review, TfL bought <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> for £310m ($458m).|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} London Underground lines (Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly) remained under a PPP {{arrangement with}} <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> until May 2010 {{when it was}} announced that Transport for London would buy out the <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> consortium.|$|R

25|$|Coloured {{turquoise}} on the Tube map, {{it is by}} far {{the shortest}} line on the Underground network at , with an end-to-end journey lasting just four minutes. In absolute terms, it is the least-used <b>Tube</b> <b>line,</b> carrying just over 15million passengers annually. However, in terms of the average number of journeys per mile it is the second-most intensively-used line behind the Victoria line.|$|E
25|$|The LPTB was nationalised in 1948, and the {{reconstruction}} of the mainline railways was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground. In 1953 an unpainted aluminium train entered service on the District line, and this became the standard for new trains. In the early 1960s the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham, and steam locomotives no longer hauled passenger trains. The Victoria line, a new <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> across central London, opened in 1968–71 with trains driven automatically. In 1976 the isolated Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the mainline railway at Finsbury Park. In 1979 another new route, the Jubilee line, took over part of the Bakerloo line; it was extended through the Docklands to Stratford in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Although {{two other}} London Underground lines operate fully underground, the Northern line {{is unusual in}} that it is a deep-level <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> that serves the outer suburbs of South London yet there is only one station above ground (Morden tube station) while the rest of this part of the line is deep below ground. The short section to Morden depot is also above ground. This is partly because its {{southern}} extension into the outer suburbs was not done by taking over an existing surface line as was generally the case with routes like the Central, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines. Apart from the core central underground tunnels, part of the section between Hendon and Colindale is also underground. As bicycles are not allowed in tunnel sections (even if no station is in that section) as they would hinder evacuation, they are limited to High Barnet – East Finchley, the Mill Hill East branch, Edgware – Colindale and Hendon Central – Golders Green. There are also time-based restrictions for the sections where bicycles are allowed.|$|E

500|$|The {{extension}} crossed farmland, {{meaning it}} could be constructed on the surface more easily and cheaply than a deep <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> below the surface. A viaduct was constructed across the Brent valley and a short section of tunnel was required at The Hyde, Hendon.

Parliamentary approval was obtained in 1897 but no work was done. In 1898, the DR took over the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B) which had a route planned from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The route was modified to join the DR deep-level route at South Kensington.|$|E

5000|$|GTJV was a {{joint venture}} between VolkerRail and Trackwork. The Joint Venture (JV) was awarded a £150 million {{contract}} from <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> in 2003 to provide track renewal for 155 km of line. This was the largest contract awarded by <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> and a further £55 million was provided for plant, materials, and Tube Lines' management support. <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> were committed to investing a billion pounds into London Underground and this was the first contract. GTJV beat its main rival Jarvis in order to win this contract. Jarvis themselves were a shareholder in <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> Company. A spokeswoman from <b>Tube</b> <b>Lines</b> said there was no pressure to award the contract to one of its own shareholders. [...] "The bid process is independent and transparent. GrantRail-Trackwork was chosen because it was the best tender." [...] GTJV will be responsible for replacing or refurbishing 35 km of track on the Jubilee line and 60 km of track on the Northern and Piccadilly Lines. The replacement of around 50% of the track will make the lines more reliable, faster, and smoother. The project lasted for seven and a half years and ended in 2010.|$|R

500|$|The C soon started {{construction}} of its southern extension which opened to a terminus at Morden on 13 September 1926, with a depot {{south of the}} station and within [...] of the W route, although no connection was made between the two lines. Without {{the extension of the}} District line to Sutton, the additional tracks between Wimbledon and Putney were not required and the work was not carried out. The additional tracks between Parsons Green and Fulham Broadway were constructed, but have only been used as sidings. Once the <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> was opened, the Underground company established a network of bus routes to the south, using Morden station as their hub. These routes {{had a significant impact on}} the SR's operations in the area, with the SR estimating in 1928 that it had lost approximately four million passengers per year. The UERL, though, was able to demonstrate that its passenger numbers on its buses to Sutton station were actually more than double those for Morden.|$|E
500|$|During the {{progress}} of their 1896 bills through parliament, the DR and the B established a relationship through a successful joint campaign of opposition to a competing proposal from the City & West End Railway. This was for a tube railway running from Hammersmith to Cannon Street, which would have duplicated parts of the DR's and the B's approved routes. In late 1898, this common interest led [...] to {{the purchase of the}} B by the DR. In November 1898 a bill for the B was announced, which sought permission for short extensions at each end of its route: at its eastern end, from Piccadilly Circus to Cranbourn Street and, at the western end, connections between the B's tunnels and those of the DR's deep <b>tube</b> <b>line.</b> Parliament rejected the eastern extension, but permitted the connection between the two lines and approved a capital injection from the DR into the B The bill received royal assent on 9 August 1899 as the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway (Extensions) Act, 1899.|$|E
2500|$|For most of {{its length}} it is a deep-level <b>tube</b> <b>line.</b> The portion between [...] and [...] opened in 1890 and is the oldest section of deep-level <b>tube</b> <b>line</b> on the Underground network.

It is unique in having two different routes through central London. Despite its name, it does not serve the northern-most stations on the network, though it does serve the southern-most station, Morden, as well as 16 of the system's 29 stations south of the River Thames. There are 50 stations in total on the line, of which 36 have platforms below ground.|$|E

[...] The first underground railways in London, the Metropolitan Railway (MR) and the District Railway (DR), used specially built steam locomotives to haul their trains through shallow tunnels which had many ventilation openings to allow steam and smoke to clear from the tunnels. It was impractical to use steam locomotives in the small unvented tubular tunnels of the deep-level lines, and the only options were rope haulage (as on the Glasgow Underground) or electric locomotives.|$|E
