500|$|As {{early as}} 2004, agents working for Afghan {{intelligence}} determined that Bin Laden {{was living in}} a major settled area in Pakistan proper, rather than the semi-autonomous tribal areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Amrullah Saleh told The Guardian. Leading Saleh and Afghan intelligence <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion</b> were [...] "thousands of interrogation reports" [...] and the assumption that Bin Laden [...] "a millionaire with multiple wives and no background of toughness would not be living in a tent". [...] "I was pretty sure he was in the settled areas of Pakistan because in 2005 it was still very easy to infiltrate the tribal areas, and we had massive numbers of informants there. They could find any Arab but not Bin Laden." ...|$|E
500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately leaped <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion</b> when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his baby sister Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1962 book, Night Drop: The American Airborne Invasion of Normandy, Army {{historian}} S.L.A. Marshall {{concluded that}} the mixed performance overall of the airborne troops in Normandy resulted from poor performance by the troop carrier pilots. In coming <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion</b> he did not interview any aircrew nor qualify his opinion to that extent, nor did he acknowledge that British airborne operations {{on the same night}} succeeded despite also being widely scattered. [...] Marshall’s original data came from after-action interviews with paratroopers after their return to England in July 1944, which was also the basis of all U.S. Army histories on the campaign written after the war, and which he later incorporated in his own commercial book.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{distribution}} {{deal with}} Unicorn—which {{was associated with}} MCA Records—resulted in an initial pressing of 25,000 copies. MCA Records president Al Bergamo listened to the album prior to release and claimed that it was [...] "anti-parent", although he never cited a specific lyric that led him <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion.</b> As a result, MCA refused to distribute the already-pressed-and-packaged album which bore an MCA Distributing Corp. logo on the lower {{right corner of the}} back cover. Black Flag members had to personally visit the pressing plant and apply a sticker over the MCA logo which read, [...] "As a parent... I found it an anti-parent record"—thus essentially throwing Bergamo's words back in his face.|$|E

This may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do, but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, justify the jury in coming <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The book {{starts in}} the preterite, [...] "Oeroeg was my friend", and in reverse chronological order tells how the narrator came <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion.</b> The narrator grows up {{the child of a}} white Dutch family on Java, with Oeroeg, a native young man; as high-school {{students}} they live together in a boarding house. One crucial event is the death of Oeroeg's father, who died while saving the narrator from drowning. During World War II the narrator joins the Dutch army, and when he returns to Java finds that the world has changed: Indonesian nationalists have declared independence, and no longer accept the colonial overlord. In addition, the narrator's father is murdered, and he suspects his old friend, who has joined the Indonesian nationalist movement, of avenging his own father's death. At the end of the novel, the narrator has lost his friend, his identity, and his home country.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{questions}} raised {{as to the}} accuracy of the information and the evidence used in the trial. Dr. Elaine Samuels, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, had originally concluded that hairs recovered from the body were consistent with that of the victim; after Dr. Samuels had come <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion,</b> the hair evidence was examined by Diane Hanson, a hair analyst from a crime lab in Madison, Wisconsin. Hanson stated that two of the hairs were consistent with samples taken from Laurie Bembenek's hairbrush. Dr. Samuels refuted that claim, stating in a 1983 letter, quoted in the Toronto Star in 1991, that [...] "I recovered no blonde or red hairs of any length or texture ... ll of the hairs I recovered from the body were brown and were grossly identical to the hair of the victim ... do not like to suggest that evidence was altered in any way, but I can find no logical explanation for what amounted to the mysterious appearance of blonde hair in an envelope that contained no such hair {{at the time it was}} sealed by me." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Ellison's 2006 campaign, Republican blogger Michael Brodkorb {{unearthed}} posts about Ellison's Minnesota Daily {{articles and}} {{his involvement with}} the Nation of Islam. In response, Ellison {{wrote a letter to}} the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota & the Dakotas saying he had never been a member, and that his connections with the Nation of Islam were limited to an 18-month period during which he helped organize the Minnesota contingent at the 1995 Million Man March. In 2016, CNN referred instead to Ellison's [...] "decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam". In Ellison's letter, he denounced the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, writing, [...] "I wrongly dismissed concerns that they [...] were anti-Semitic. They were and are anti-Semitic and I should have come <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>conclusion</b> earlier than I did." [...] He explained his previous views, saying that he [...] "did not adequately scrutinize the positions and statements of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed." [...] He also stated, [...] "any kind of discrimination and hate are wrong. This has always been my position". During the 2006 campaign, many prominent Jewish DFL activists supported Ellison, including fundraisers Samuel and Sylvia Kaplan, and State Representative Phyllis Kahn, who said it was [...] "inconceivable that he could have ever been an anti-Semite." ...|$|E
