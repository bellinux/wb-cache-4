5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
5|$|It {{was then}} that II./JG 1 arrived. Fw. Edger Ardner of 5./JG 1 was engaged by two Spitfires and shot down, bailing out and taken prisoner. No. 317 Squadron then joined <b>the</b> <b>mêlée</b> upon arrival. Warrant Officer Stanisław Piesik shot down another Fw 190.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. <b>The</b> <b>melee</b> combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E

5|$|The Auburn Tigers upset {{expectations}} and tied the Commodores 7–7. Ammie Sikes scored first for Vanderbilt. Auburn scored after a Sikes fumble. The ball was kicked some fifteen yards down field clear of <b>the</b> <b>melee,</b> {{picked up by}} Kirk Newell, and run 55 yards to the end zone.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered <b>the</b> <b>melee,</b> but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Boucaud scored {{his first}} goal for York with a 12-yard {{shot into the}} bottom corner in a 5–1 victory away to Kettering on 23 August 2011. He was handed a three-match {{suspension}} after being red carded during a 0–0 draw away to Barrow on 19 November 2011 after being adjudged by the referee to have raised his arms during <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> following the sending off of teammate Jason Walker during stoppage time.

5|$|Re di Portogallo saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She engaged several Austrian wooden vessels in <b>the</b> <b>melee,</b> {{including}} ship of the line , which rammed Re di Portogallo but inflicted no significant damage. The ship's career after the war was very limited; in 1871, she was converted into a training ship. By 1875, her wooden hull {{was found to have}} deteriorated badly, and so she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{believed}} their ships {{to have less}} effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In <b>the</b> <b>melée</b> which followed both sides were frustrated {{by the lack of}} damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming—nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.|$|E
5|$|Then, in a {{calculated}} attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked {{from the main}} road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe riot in the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with iron bars and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted to break up <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> with dogs and tear gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport {{the day after the}} game.|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the purses {{for both}} fighters were {{withheld}} until {{video of the}} fight could be reviewed. Don King argued that Mayweather should have been disqualified because his uncle {{was the first person}} to enter the ring. At an April 13 hearing, the Nevada State Athletic Commission fined Roger Mayweather $200,000 and revoked his boxing license for one year. At a hearing on May 8, the Commission disciplined the other offenders in <b>the</b> <b>melee.</b> It fined Yoel Judah $100,000 and revoked his license for one year, fined Mayweather cornerman Leonard Ellerbe $50,000 and suspended his license for four months, and fined Zab Judah $350,000 and revoked his license for one year.|$|E
5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the line behind Sans Pareil and threw herself into <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E

5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined <b>the</b> <b>melee,</b> and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grand Slam commences, and {{it turns}} out that Leiter has indeed found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in <b>the</b> <b>melee.</b> Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been {{captured}} by Goldfinger, who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.|$|E
5|$|That day, the Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62 {{percent of}} the French/Imperial artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. With some 3,500 {{horsemen}} and 20 cannons, plus a portion of Prince Henry's regiment of infantry, the Prussian army had defeated the combined armies of two European powers, France and the Holy Roman Empire. The tactics at Rossbach became a landmark {{in the history of}} military art. The same night, on the field, the King awarded Seydlitz the Order of the Black Eagle, and promoted him to lieutenant general. Seydlitz had been wounded during <b>the</b> <b>melée</b> and he remained out of action for four months, nursed by a lady in Leipzig.|$|E

50|$|A curfew {{was again}} clamped on the worst-hit Ganeshguri in the afternoon, {{after the initial}} curfew was relaxed the {{previous}} evening, as an angry mob braved tight security {{in the presence of}} the city SS and went on a rampage. The police then resorted to firing blanks, injuring at least five people in <b>the</b> ensuing <b>melee.</b> <b>The</b> leader of the opposition and former Deputy Prime Minister Advani visited the spot just minutes before the disturbance.|$|R
5|$|The brawl {{started after}} the hour mark; Winterburn made a lunging tackle on Irwin, who was {{challenging}} Limpar for the ball. McClair and Irwin retaliated against Winterburn and Limpar, whom Ince pushed onto the advertising hoardings. All 11 United players and 10 Arsenal players on the pitch partook in <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> (goalkeeper David Seaman was the only player to remain uninvolved), though most were attempting to calm the situation. The fracas lasted less than 20 seconds; once it died down, Hackett booked Limpar and Winterburn for their involvement, while the United players escaped punishment. Tony Adams, praised by The Guardian correspondent Stephen Bierley {{for his role in}} defusing matters, avoided a caution for a professional foul on McClair later on.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} at Eckmühl {{was followed}} by another at Regensburg (also called the Battle of Ratisbon) on 23 April, where Klenau, {{at the head of}} six squadrons of Merveldt's Uhlanen (lancers), was crushed and scattered by Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's heavy cavalry. Klenau and Major General Peter Vécsey stormed back at Nansouty's force with the Klenau chevauxlegers. Although their onslaught threw back the leading French squadrons, the French heavy cavalry returned, joined by Hussars and Chasseurs. In <b>the</b> <b>mêlee,</b> it was difficult to distinguish French from Austrian, but eventually the French horse overwhelmed the Austrian flank and pushed them to the gates of Regensburg.|$|E
5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter. With Donegal alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship and steered for <b>the</b> <b>melee</b> surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and attached a towline to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E
