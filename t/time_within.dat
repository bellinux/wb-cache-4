5|$|A Night to Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book {{but was a}} huge success, thanks {{in no small part}} to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955.

5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected that the security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how.

5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a lap <b>time</b> <b>within</b> 107% of {{the fastest}} time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element, Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E

5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of the North Koreans at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short <b>time.</b> <b>Within</b> a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the North Koreans could not keep up the strength of their attacks.

5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to talk about the Bastille or their <b>time</b> <b>within</b> it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E

The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 17.

5|$|During 655, Æthelhere {{joined with}} Penda in {{an assault on}} Northumbria. Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere's motive for {{changing}} sides was to deflect Penda's attention from East Anglia {{and the destruction of}} his kingdom that would have ensued. Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty duces regii (or royal commanders) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons. He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai, in the district of Loidis, which was probably at that <b>time</b> <b>within</b> the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged. Oswiu offered him a great ransom of treasure which, according to Bede, was refused (or according to the Historia Brittonum, was accepted and distributed)— in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians. Oswiu had a much smaller force, but in the event the Welsh armies of King Cadfæl of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda's ally Œthelwald of Deira stood aside to await the outcome.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of <b>time</b> <b>within</b> the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} portion of Brighton, NY31 meets I-590 {{by way of}} an {{interchange}} and intersects NY65.

Just inside the village limits, NY31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the West Shore Subdivision at-grade. In the village center, NY31 intersects NY96. East of NY96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the Perinton town line at exit26.

5|$|Lambeosaurus lambei and L. magnicristatus, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{were members of}} a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms. The anatomically similar L. lambei, L. magnicristatus, and Corythosaurus were separated by <b>time</b> <b>within</b> the formation, based on stratigraphy. Corythosaurus fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, L. lambei fossils {{are present in the}} upper third, and L. magnicristatus remains are rare and present only at the very top, where the marine influence was greater.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana uses an action-based battle system {{similar to}} other entries in the Mana series: {{navigation}} and actions occur in real <b>time</b> <b>within</b> battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it. After each battle, treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars. During battle, the character can attack, switching forms to deliver different attacks, and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed. During battle, assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. After each skill is used in battle, a cooldown meter is activated. The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty. Three types of weapons are available in-game: swords, spears and bows. Each weapon, when equipped, grants a different skill and elemental attribute. The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element. Enemies can also be weak to attacks using certain weapons. In addition to single-player battles, raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit <b>time</b> <b>within</b> the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E
