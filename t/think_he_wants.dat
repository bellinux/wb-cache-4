500|$|Azaria played Gargamel in the computer-animated/live-action {{adaptation}} of The Smurfs (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, {{as well as}} shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair {{over the course of}} the production. Azaria considered Gargamel's voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an [...] "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" [...] voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell's from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and [...] "just this straight villain"; he opted to make Gargamel [...] "more sarcastic" [...] than in the cartoon, but [...] "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs". He interpreted him as [...] "very lonely", adding that [...] "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants in really badly. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to be embraced as a Smurf". Azaria worked with the writers to [...] "infuse" [...] the script with some of his ideas about the character, [...] "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [...] Azreal [...] " [...] which Azaria conceived.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Criss as Blaine, a gay {{member of}} a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a [...] "cute, charismatic, gay high school junior" [...] who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once {{for the role of}} Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, [...] "At this point, Kurt's [...] has been such a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [...] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [...] the same things that he had to deal with, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to impart that knowledge." [...] Murphy described Blaine as a character with [...] "great self-loathing" [...] and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriend—a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinn—but based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Battlefield", {{from the}} This Is My Battlefield 2004 Panzer AG album samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in {{reference}} to Miguel's zombie bite: [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to walk around after he's dead? You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{to be one of}} these things?" [...] The line [...] "Sit down or so help me god I'll have you shot" [...] appears once {{near the end of the}} song.|$|E

2500|$|Trainer Willie Mullins was gearing Faugheen {{towards a}} future chasing career during his novice season [...] "I would imagine he's a chaser. He wants fences to maybe make him drop the bridle and travel" [...] and having his first career {{win in a}} PTP race which uses similar fences to those used for chase races, the {{transition}} {{was expected to be}} beneficial by Mullins who provided an explanation after his win in the Grade 1 Cheltenham Novices' Hurdle where he made a few jumping errors: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> fences. He has a disregard for hurdles, he just wants to go. Fences might make him respect things more".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{controversy}} concerning biblical {{accuracy and}} {{content in the}} writing of the script arose over statements from Ridley Scott that he would be looking to natural causes for the miracles, including drainage from a tsunami for the parting of the Red Sea. [...] According to Scott, the parting of the Red Sea was inspired by a tsunami believed to have been triggered by an underwater earthquake off the Italian coast around 3000 BC. This, combined with statements from Christian Bale about Moses, whom he portrayed ("I think the man was likely schizophrenic {{and was one of the}} most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life"), raised criticism. Those who voiced their concern included author Brian Godawa saying, [...] "It's accurate to portray Moses as an imperfect hero, so Christians won't take issue with that, but to be so extreme as to call him one of the most barbaric people in history, that sounds like he's going out of his way to distance himself from the very people you’d <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to appeal to." [...] Another was the CEO of Faith-Driven Consumer, Chris Stone, saying about Bale's comments [...] "There's nothing in the biblical history that supports that. It's an indication that there will be a tremendous disconnect between Bale’s interpretation and the expectations of the market" [...] and suggesting that Christians will not go to cinemas to see the film.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 449 BC, Pericles {{proposed}} the Congress Decree, {{which led to a}} meeting ("Congress") of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta's stance, but Pericles' intentions remain unclear. Some historians <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities; others <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to assert Athenian pre-eminence. According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the Delian League and for the collection of [...] "phoros" [...] (taxes).|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! The rascal is {{come over}} to my side. What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to say?

The scoundrel!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to {{quarrel with}} any one;--but above all {{he must not}} quarrel with me. Lord Fawn has quarrelled with him, and that's a misfortune,--just for the present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Caleb, {{looking up}} gravely, [...] "there is {{something}} wrong--a stranger, {{who is very}} ill, I <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> a doctor, and I came to tell you of that. His name is Raffles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beatem, Beatem, {{come over}} to my room. This man is {{absolutely}} the biggest thing in America. For sheer calmness and nerve I never heard of anything to approach him. What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to do?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What do I make of it? Can't you see, Sam? Tom {{was trying}} to <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> to get {{something}} that was hidden away in his memory--his own name, and mine and yours, and Nellie's, {{and the name of}} Brill.

6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it? Well, perhaps he's had his fortune told, or you can ask him. Anyway, although I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to, <b>he</b> dared not turn her back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, {{has been}} telling that at some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen {{crouching}} behind a tree.

6000|$|... "Personally," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I {{believe that it}} is just the call of England to a man who lived very near the soil--her heart. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> the smell of spring flowers, the stillness of an English autumn, the winds of February in the woods he was brought up in. It is a form of heart-sickness, you know. I have felt it myself so often. It is {{scarcely}} possible that after all these years he is still nursing that bitter hatred of us both." ...|$|E
60|$|January 12.--Mathews {{last night}} {{gave us a}} very perfect {{imitation}} of old Cumberland, who carried the poetic jealousy and irritability further than any man I ever saw. He was a great flatterer too, the old rogue. Will Erskine used to admire him. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> originality. A very high-bred man in point of manners in society.|$|R

According to Smith {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, [...] "Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to try and break through into the mainstream, and I had some experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David." ...|$|R
