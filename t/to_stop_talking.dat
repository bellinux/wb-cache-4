5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after his}} return, {{he joined the}} {{government}} geology service. He became disillusioned with a government job and quit to write plays and live a bohemian life. His father's failed ambitious plan that he would become the Director General of the Geology Department led him <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of St. Peter's led to federal {{approval for a}} post office at the mission in 1885. After arriving in Montana, Mother Amadeus asked Bishop Brondel to give her control over the Ursulines, but he declined to do so. Amadeus repeatedly asked Mother Stanislaus, head of the Toledo chapterhouse (and who exercised authority over the Ursulines at St. Peter's), for more sisters {{to help with the}} work in Montana. Her requests were denied. She appealed to Richard Gilmour, Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio. When Mother Stanislaus complained, Mother Amadeus denied she was making an end-run around the chapterhouse, claiming instead that she was acting under instruction from Bishop Brondel. In February 1886, Bishop Gilmour ordered the Ursulines in Toledo <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about how much they wished to teach in Montana, and ordered the St. Peter's Ursulines separated from the Toledo chapter.|$|E

500|$|During {{a college}} lecture where Dr. Maggie Walsh is {{discussing}} {{the difference between}} language and communication, Buffy has a dream in which Riley kisses her. They are interrupted by a young girl holding a distinctive box, singing a cryptic rhyme about [...] "The Gentlemen". Riley and Buffy speak after class and they almost kiss, but are unable <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking.</b> They leave when it becomes awkward. Buffy calls Giles to tell him of her dream and {{the details of the}} little girl's rhyme.|$|E
500|$|Angelou and {{her brother}} lived with their {{grandmother}} and her son, Uncle Willie, until Angelou was thirteen. [...] They briefly visited their mother in St. Louis, but {{at the age of}} eight Angelou was raped, and in retaliation the rapist was killed by members of her family. [...] She felt so guilty for his death that she chose <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> to everyone but Bailey for several years. [...] They were sent back to Stamps, but when Bailey turned 14, they returned to their mother's care in San Francisco for his protection. [...] At first, Angelou was resistant and angry towards her mother for abandoning her and Bailey, choosing to call her [...] "Lady", and it took her several years to warm to her.|$|E
500|$|... "Hush" [...] explores issues {{relating}} to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed {{as a means of}} avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode's plot or to the show's overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how [...] "inevitably coherent" [...] this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking.</b> Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy [...] "Talk, all talk. Blah blah Gaia. Blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was hoping we would get into something real, but..." [...] These pseudo conversations are what Buffy essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as [...] "locutionary acts": language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.|$|E

60|$|The boat landed General Craufurd at {{the same}} landing-place at which Tom and Peter had disembarked half an hour before. Lieutenant Armstrong had spoken {{a few words to}} the officer who was superintending the landing of stores and horses, and he, being far too busy <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> briefly said that the boys could go up to join their {{regiment}} with a convoy of stores which would start that night.|$|R

500|$|Cameron {{agreed to}} meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Upon meeting him, however, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger who would {{talk about how the}} villain should be played. Cameron began {{sketching}} his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that [...] "he'd make a hell of a Terminator". Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, [...] "Oh some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks." [...] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. He also wrote that [...] "it took [...] awhile to figure out that Jim [...] was the real deal." [...] In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons {{to be able to use}} them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. James Cameron said that [...] "Somehow, even his [...] accent worked... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Souter, {{writing for}} the plurality, focused on the actual {{effectiveness}} of Miranda warnings given after an earlier unwarned confession. [...] Just giving the warnings is not necessarily good enough. [...] Instead, a court must ask, [...] "Could the warnings effectively advise the suspect {{that he had a}} real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture? [...] Could they reasonably convey that he could choose <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> even if he had talked earlier?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the trial, Hunt asked Anthony whether she had {{anything}} to say. She responded with [...] "the most famous speech {{in the history of the}} agitation for woman suffrage", according to Ann D. Gordon, a historian of the women's movement. Repeatedly ignoring the judge's order <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> and sit down, she protested what she called [...] "this high-handed outrage upon my citizen's rights ... you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government. My natural rights, my civil rights, my political rights, my judicial rights, are all alike ignored." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Mandela <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to street}} {{children}} in Cape Town, and {{was inspired to}} found organisation. He remarked: [...] "We were driving back to the Presidency in Cape Town one cold winter's evening, when I saw a group of street children and <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them.""The children asked me why I love them. This astounded me, and I asked them why they asked this, {{and they said that}} because every time I get money from overseas, I share it with them." ...|$|R

2500|$|Hunter R. Rawlings III, President of the {{prominent}} Association of American Universities research group of universities to which UVA is an elected member, came to Charlottesville {{to make a}} speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: [...] "there's no possibility, as far as I can see, that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university". He encouraged university leaders <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.|$|E

With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. I decided it was time <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Freeman {{criticized the}} celebration of Black History Month , saying, [...] "I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history." [...] He says {{the only way to}} end racism is <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about it, and he notes that there is no [...] "white history month." [...] Freeman once said in an {{interview}} with 60 Minutess Mike Wallace, [...] "I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man." [...] Freeman supported the defeated proposal to change the Mississippi state flag, which contains the Confederate battle flag. Freeman sparked controversy in 2011 when, on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, he accused the Tea Party movement of racism.|$|E

2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, tell him <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> {{about me and}} take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 1943, realizing the war was lost, Papen began {{attending}} secret meetings with the agents of the OSS in Istanbul. The meetings were held in Istanbul as Papen was afraid to meet in Ankara because the SD officer Ludwig Carl Moyzisch had orders from Heinrich Himmler to monitor Papen, which the ambassador knew about. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer described Papen as [...] "… a loner, an outsider, a man of tremendous personal ambition and great vanity". Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for American support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany, as Papen wanted a right-wing regime that would avoid the [...] "excesses" [...] of the Nazis. Moyzisch had been monitoring Papen, and was aware of Papen meeting the OSS, but Himmler was seeking a separate peace with the Western Allies to allow Germany to focus on defeating the Soviet Union, and ordered Moyzisch to allow the meetings to go ahead. On 5 October 1943, Papen met with the American OSS agent and journalist Theodore Morde of Reader's Digest, to tell him that he wanted American support to overthrow Hitler and make himself the new dictator of Germany, saying the terms of peace would be that Germany would remain the dominant power in Europe and suggested under his leadership that Germany and the United States would become allies against the Soviet Union. President Franklin Roosevelt rejected this offer when he heard of it, saying he was very doubtful that Papen had the sort of power that he claimed to have to overthrow Hitler, and told the OSS <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> to Papen. At the same time, Papen hedged his bets, telling Hitler that he had information from his American contacts to the effect that if the Republicans won the 1944 election, then the United States would make peace with Germany in order to focus on defeating Japan, thereby allowing Germany to defeat Britain and the Soviet Union, and therefore German foreign policy should aim at ensuring President Roosevelt lost the 1944 election. Papen claimed to Hitler that he was talking to the OSS with the intention of making contact with the Republicans to ensure Roosevelt's defeat in the 1944 election.|$|E
