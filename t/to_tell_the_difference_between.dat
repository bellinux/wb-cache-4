5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One {{solution}} to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, it can be difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E

25|$|Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, {{checking}} things (e.g., {{locks on}} doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning {{on and off}} switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance. Compulsions are different from tics (such as touching, tapping, rubbing or blinking) and stereotyped movements (such as head banging, body rocking or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions. It can sometimes be difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> compulsions and complex tics. About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.|$|E
25|$|Music-specific neural {{networks}} {{exist in the}} brain {{for a variety of}} music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct {{neural networks}} also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that {{there are at least two}} distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.|$|E
500|$|Small, {{relatively}} weak landspouts may be visible {{only as a}} small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend {{all the way to}} the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than , the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a [...] "stovepipe" [...] tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as [...] "wedge tornadoes" [...] or [...] "wedges". The [...] "stovepipe" [...] classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance.

500|$|All {{but two of}} {{the drum}} tracks are {{composed}} of samples performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig. Because Ó Cíosóig was suffering from physical and personal problems during the album's recording, samples of various drum patterns {{that he was able to}} perform in his condition were recorded. According to Shields, [...] "t's exactly what Colm would have done, it just took longer to do." [...] Ó Cíosóig recovered enough to play live on two of the album's songs, [...] "Only Shallow" [...] and [...] "Touched", the latter of which was composed and performed entirely by the drummer. Shields believes that listeners are unable <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> Ó Cíosóig's live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously [...] "sampled" [...] sound, like the dance-oriented [...] "Soon". The album makes extensive use of samples, with Shields stating, [...] "Most of the samples are feedback.

500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." [...] The Observers Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1952 Imperials were {{practically}} {{identical to the}} 1951 models, and {{the most effective way}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> them is through reference to serial numbers. The convertible bodystyle was dropped in 1952. Unlike the case with Chryslers, the Imperial's taillights were not changed. Power steering was standard. The [...] "new" [...] Imperial Crown was also unchanged for 1952. Only 338 of these cars were made in the 1951–1952 model run, and serial numbers indicate that 205 were registered as 1952 automobiles.
