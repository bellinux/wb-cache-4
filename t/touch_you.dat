2500|$|A 1964 Soviet sex manual instructed: [...] "With all {{the tricks}} at their disposal, homosexuals seek out {{and win the}} {{confidence}} of youngsters. Then they proceed to act. Do not under any circumstances allow them to <b>touch</b> <b>you.</b> Such people should be immediately reported to the administrative organs {{so that they can}} be removed from society." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1940s, a {{man known}} as [...] "Big Spear Liu" [...] came to Shanghai's [...] "big world," [...] the city's major {{performance}} and entertainment centre. Liu asked the doorkeeper, [...] "Are there any good hands around here?", {{looking for a}} skilled opponent to challenge. The doorkeeper told [...] "Big Spear Liu" [...] of Tian Zhaolin (student of Yang Jianhou). [...] With that Liu set off to find him. He found Tian Zhaolin and immediately demanded to spar by each striking the other three times, to which Tian Zhaolin responded {{that it may not}} be necessary. He said, [...] "Just let me <b>touch</b> <b>you.</b> If you can tolerate my <b>touch,</b> <b>you</b> win." [...] Liu, sensing a fool and an effortless victory, immediately agreed. The two men approached and Tian Zhaolin reached out his hand to touch Liu's chest. Within a few moments, Liu's facial muscles started to contort. Soon he grimaced and his face showed signs of intense pain. Spear Liu pulled away and, after recovering, commented, [...] "I have travelled throughout five provinces and various cities but until today I have never seen such a profound skill." [...] Energy, including that of taijiquan, may be thought of as transmission by wave. [...] Earlier generation adepts in taijiquan had an expression—"hitting the cow {{on this side of the}} Mountain." [...] This phrase referred to hitting an opponent's front side with the pain and effect being felt on the back side. [...] In years past, people who sparred with Yang Shaohou often described him as also having an energy like electricity. That is, it caused very painful sensations in the muscle and even on the skin surface. Tian Zhaolin, coming from that background, also knew this method.|$|E

In May, she starred in a Todrick Hall video, [...] "Beauty and the Beat Boots". and {{appeared}} in the Season 2 finale of the Condé Nast Entertainment webseries #HeyUSA, with host Mamrie Hart. In June and July, both as herself and as Miranda, Ballinger starred in a six-episode beauty series parody, called How to Makeup, on the I Love Makeup YouTube channel operated by Collective Digital Studio. In this show, [...] "Colleen has fantastically found a way for guys to become interested in a makeup show that isn’t called 'Naked Ladies Wear Makeup While Kissing Each Other and Boobies and Stuff' ... there’s a plot to this makeup show". In July 2015, Re/code featured Ballinger to exemplify [...] "an emerging economy" [...] of internet content providers. She is featured on the track [...] "Clouds" [...] in Flula Borg's 2015 EP, I Want to <b>Touch</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Halloween Horror Nights IV was {{the first}} year to {{introduce}} a [...] "scare zone", a name given to specific outdoor areas that feature costumed characters that fit the theme {{with the intent of}} scaring people who walk through the areas. To get to certain areas of the park, it is necessary to travel through these scare zones. In 2012, Orlando re-envisioned the scare zones as [...] "street experiences," [...] claiming that scare actors were no longer restricted to specific [...] "zones." [...] Instead, {{there were a number of}} [...] "hordes" [...] which would change their location in the park every 90 minutes. [...] By 2014, the traditional scare zones returned with The Purge: Anarchy (inspired by [...] ), Face Off: In the Flesh, Bayou of Blood, and MASKerade: Unstitched. However, Hollywood Horror Nights in California still has specific scare zones, that range in themes. While actors cannot <b>touch</b> <b>you,</b> many of them can surround you at one time. Many actors in these areas have props like bats, chainsaws and fake guns and can act like they are going to attack you with their [...] "weapons". Many times actors will place the chainsaws against the cement to produce sparks to scare audiences. Actors are also allowed to chase visitors in and out of the scare zone.|$|E
2500|$|Aqua {{released}} {{their third}} single [...] "Barbie Girl" [...] in May 1997. The song, at first glance, {{appears to be}} about the popular children's doll Barbie. However, at second glance, the song contains several sexual overtones, such as [...] "You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere", [...] "You can <b>touch,</b> <b>you</b> can play", and [...] "Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky-panky". This caused some controversy upon its release in Denmark, but despite the controversy and perhaps partly due to it, it still sold well and easily made number one in the charts. The song was so popular that it was played regularly on radio stations which did not air dance music. Universal Music decided to ignore complaints about the double meanings in [...] "Barbie Girl", and successfully released the single around the world in September and October 1997. The release was highly successful, making number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks, in Australia for three weeks, and even managing to make the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, something rarely achieved at the time by European pop acts. The song and group became a household name overnight, but to most of the world were instantly written off as a one-hit wonder. The double meanings in [...] "Barbie Girl" [...] caused the expected controversy, with many complaints aimed at Universal for releasing the track.|$|E
