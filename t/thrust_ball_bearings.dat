40|$|A {{parachute}} {{swivel mechanism}} (PSM) for planetary entry missions {{such as a}} Mars probe (MARSNET) or return of cometary material samples (ROSETTA mission) has been developed. The purpose of the PSM is to decouple the spin of the probe from the parachute, with low friction torque, during both the deployment and descent phases. Critical requirements are high shock loads, low friction, low temperatures, and several years of storage in the deep space environment (during the cruise phase of the probe, prior to operation). The design uses a main <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> {{to cope with the}} load requirement and a smaller <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> for guiding of the shaft.

The balls of 2. 4 mm in radius are used and the radii of the curvature of the dimples of 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm are used in this research.

The friction torque and operating temperatures in a thrust ball bearing were measured during the tests.

A rolling bearing friction torque model was used and the coefficient of friction in full film lubrication was determined for each grease, depending on the operating conditions. The experimental results obtained showed that grease formulation had a very significant influence on friction torque and operating temperature. The friction torque depends on the viscosity of the grease base oil, on its nature (mineral, ester, PAO, etc.), on the coefficient of friction in full film conditions, but also on the interaction between grease thickener and base oil, which affected contact replenishment and contact starvation, and thus influenced the friction torque...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface originated flaking and subsurface originated flaking. It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface originated flaking due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface originated flaking about microstructural change. In this study, surface originated flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. <b>Thrust</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> and radial <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent originated flaking was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface originated flaking was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface originated flaking compared with subsurface originated flaking when the specimens were flaking. This suggests that surface originated flaking occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface originated flaking shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface originated flaking than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface originated flaking and subsurface originated flaking...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of {{rotating}} machinery it is often necessary to bolt components together with a known preload since the same controls the system dynamics considerably. Since a major percentage bolt tightening torque is resisted by frictional forces especially {{towards the end of}} tightening, and since the coefficient of friction in threads and under the bolt head to a large degree is indeterminate, the best method of ensuring desired clamping load is by measurement of bolt elongation, or by a load cell. However in large number of cases the incorporation of load cell is not practical and bolt elongation is insufficient to allow accurate measurement. ln such cases it becomes necessary to produce the desired end load by applying a specified torque to the bolt leading to the determination of nut factor. for each of the cases Here an attempt has been made to obtain the quantitative values of nut factors for bolted joints as a function of bolt diameter and tightening torque applied on bolted joints. A simple test rig 1 was designed and fabricated for the purpose in which the experiments were conducted. The instrumentation basically includes the monitoring of the bolt tightening torque through the torque wrench, and a load cell measures the clamping force developed in the joint. These experiments were conducted with <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> and also without <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> bearing; resulting in possible analysis of the friction generated between nut and bolt threads and also between nut-washer surfaces. The results include generation of nut factors and coefficient of friction values developed for different torques and different bolt diameters, by using a mathematical relation which relates the bolt geometry, clamping force and the tightening torque applied. Also an effort has been made to develop a curve fit equation for nut factor values from experimental data leading to quantitative estimation of nut factors as a function of bolt diameter and tightening torque. ...|$|R

Condition monitoring (CM), an inherent component of CBM, is the process of collecting real-time sensory information from a functioning device in order to reason about the health of the device and predict its future performance. To effectively use CM information, it is useful to characterize a component degradation signal, which is a characteristic pattern in the sensor information that evolves with respect to component 2 ̆ 7 s operating time and condition. ^ Our approach considers monitoring a single component, a <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing,</b> which is an inherent component in every type of rotational mechanical assembly. The goal of this research is to develop decision support models that use real-time condition monitoring information and degradation signals to improve maintenance and replacement decisions. We develop Neural Network models that utilize vibration-based sensory information to estimate failure times of partially degraded thrust bearings at various points in their service life. Empirical Bayes and Maximum Likelihood Estimation approaches are then used to compute bearing residual life distributions, which are continuously updated with every data acquisition. We also develop a random coefficients model that combines degradation characteristics of the bearing 2 ̆ 7 s population along with real-time vibration information from a specific bearing with the objective of computing remaining life distributions. Bayesian updating is then used to revise residual life distributions with each new sensory acquisition from a partially degraded bearing. ^ The remaining life distributions computed using the neural network models and the Bayesian degradation models are used in conjunction with a simple age replacement model developed in Renewal Theory to compute optimal replacement times that correspond to the minimum long-run average replacement cost per unit time. Results from the replacement model change according to the updated remaining life distributions with each data acquisition process. ^ We believe the major contribution of this research will be in decision making under large scale condition monitoring to support maintenance, replacement, and inventory policies when hundreds of components are being monitored simultaneously. ...|$|R

The following topics have been considered: design for disabled customers, maximum ease of use and low cost technology. This job therefore has coped the main problems related to designing a new car. Some innovative solutions have been proposed and an overall design procedure has been experienced. This paper in particular describes the results of a research activity connected with the study of the general lay-out of such a wheel set. Some different configurations were explored, each showing its strong and weak points. It is to point out that, while the traditional arrangements connected with gasoline or diesel engines were hugely studied, with the electric traction all the wheel sets must be reshaped. In fact too many car designers tend to use the same lay-out used before, wasting much of the potential advantages offered by electric motors. During this study some radically new designs were explored, for example not using any live axle for transmission or trying to use <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> for steering axles. In the following a gallery of proposed and studied solutions will be exposed, showing the most characteristic points. We developed the study and design phases starting from some specifications: the group must be composed by electric motor (geared or not), brake, wheel hub, front or rear traction, in case of front traction the group must have steering pivots (attachments for steering rods). This apparatus has been designed to be used in a light car (which is under development in our faculty). However the proposed design may fit even standard city cars.
