500|$|The {{official}} English {{translation of}} Final Fantasy V began {{shortly after the}} release of the Japanese version. The game was to be titled [...] "Final Fantasy III" [...] in North America, but the project fell through. Square then announced that due to its differing tone and much higher difficulty {{from the rest of the}} series, they would be releasing it in North America as a standalone game with a yet-to-be-determined title, rather than part of the Final Fantasy series. This plan was quickly aborted. Translator Ted Woolsey explained in a 1994 interview, [...] " [...] just not accessible enough to the average gamer". Rumors circulated that a second attempt at localization would be made and that the game would be titled Final Fantasy Extreme, but this attempt was also canceled. A third attempt was made to port the game to Microsoft Windows-based personal computers for North American release by developer <b>Top</b> <b>Dog</b> Software, but this was canceled. Another attempt to port the game to Windows for North America was [...] "handled by Eidos Interactive" [...] circa 1998 (but it is unclear whether this is the same version <b>Top</b> <b>Dog</b> Software was working on or an actual fourth attempt). The continual canceling of the localization angered fans and led to Final Fantasy V becoming one of the first games to receive a complete fan translation.|$|E

But that exultation was premature, for those Black Kendah {{were by no means}} all dead. Presently I saw that scores of them had appeared among the camels, which they were engaged in stabbing, or trying to stab, in the stomach with their spears. Also I had forgotten the horsemen. As our charge slackened owing to the complication in front, these arrived on our flanks like two thunderbolts. We faced about and did our best to meet the onslaught, of which the net result was that both our left and right lines were pierced through about fifty yards behind the baggage camels. Luckily for us the very impetuosity of the Black Kendah rush deprived it of most of the fruits of victory, since the two squadrons, being unable to check their horses, ended by charging into each other and becoming mixed in inextricable confusion. Then, I do not know who gave the order, we wheeled our camels in and fell upon them, a struggling, stationary mass, with the result that many of them were speared, or overthrown and trampled.|$|E
