25|$|The {{original}} {{imaging model}} of PDF was, like PostScript's, opaque: each object {{drawn on the}} page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency <b>to</b> <b>PDF</b> was done <b>by</b> means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written <b>to</b> the <b>PDF</b> 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use {{a small amount of}} transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} the probability density function (PDF) of turbulent boundary layer fluctuating pressures measured on the outer sidewall of a supersonic transport aircraft and <b>to</b> approximate these <b>PDFs</b> <b>by</b> analytical models. Experimental flight results show that the fluctuating pressure PDFs differ from the Gaussian distribution even for standard smooth surface conditions. The PDF tails are wider and longer than those of the Gaussian model. For pressure fluctuations in front of forward-facing step discontinuities, deviations from the Gaussian model are more significant and the PDFs become asymmetrical. There is a certain spatial pattern of the skewness and kurtosis behavior depending on the distance upstream from the step. All characteristics related to non-Gaussian behavior are highly dependent upon the distance from the step and the step height, less dependent on aircraft speed, and not dependent on the fuselage location. A Hermite polynomial transform model and a piecewise-Gaussian model fit the flight data well both for the smooth and stepped conditions. The piecewise-Gaussian approximation can be additionally regarded for convenience in usage after the model is constructed...|$|R

40|$|The LHC {{has already}} {{provided}} many relevant measurements for {{the determination of}} parton distribution functions (PDFs). Measurements of the W and Z lepton distributions are of interest for flavor separation and in particular for {{the determination of the}} relatively poorly constrained strange quark distribution. In this contribution we shall discuss the computational developments that allow for the efficient inclusion of LHC data into the NNPDF framework consistently at NLO for all observables, and we study the constraints of the LHC W and Z data on the strangeness content of the proton. There {{have been a number of}} experimental measurements of direct relevance <b>to</b> <b>PDF</b> de-termination performed <b>by</b> LHC collaborations. Measurements of inclusive jet and dijet cross sections 1, 2, 3 and electroweak vector boson production 4, 5, 6 provide information on PDFs in pre-viously unexplored kinematical regions. While the importance of including LHC data in future determinations is clear, of particular interest is the potential impact of these data sets upon collider only fits, where existing determinations tend to be poorly constrained. This necessi-tates the inclusion into PDF determinations low energy data with potential contamination from nuclear corrections or higher twist effects...|$|R
