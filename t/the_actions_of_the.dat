40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model of neural {{networks}} consisting of populations of perceptive neurons, inter-neurons, and motor neurons according to <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> stochastic phase resetting dynamics. According to this model, <b>the</b> dynamical characteristics <b>of</b> neural networks are studied in three coupling cases, namely, series and parallel coupling, series coupling, and unilateral coupling. The results show that <b>the</b> indentified structure <b>of</b> neural networks enables <b>the</b> basic characteristics <b>of</b> neural information processing to be described in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> optional motor and the reflected motor. <b>The</b> excitation <b>of</b> local neural networks is caused by <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optional motor.

5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646.

The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
