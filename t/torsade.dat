Assessing an individual’s propensity to <b>Torsades</b> de Pointes {{when exposed to}} a QT-prolonging drug is challenging because baseline QT prolongation has limited predictive value. Five-minute digital 12 -lead electrocardiograms were acquired at baseline and after a sotalol challenge in 16 patients who {{had a history of}} <b>Torsades</b> de Pointes {{in the context of a}} QT-prolonging drug and 17 patients who did not have such history. Computerized measurements of QTc, T peak to T end intervals (TpTe), TpTe/QTc, and QT variability were implemented, and novel quantifiers of ventricular repolarization heterogeneity from the early (ERD) and late (LRD) part of the T wave were investigated. Compared with electrocardiograms of patients without a history of <b>Torsades</b> de Pointes, the baseline electrocardiograms of patients with a history of <b>Torsades</b> de Pointes had a longer QTc and an increased repolarization heterogeneity of the early part of the T wave (ERD 30 %: 44 ± 13 vs 35 ± 8 ms, P =. 02).

5000|$|The ECG tracing in <b>torsades</b> {{demonstrates}} a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a characteristic {{illusion of a}} twisting of the QRS complex around the isoelectric baseline (peaks, which are at first pointing up, appear to be pointing down for subsequent [...] "beats" [...] when looking at ECG traces of the [...] "heartbeat"). It is hemodynamically unstable and causes a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure, leading to dizziness and fainting. Depending on their cause, most individual episodes of <b>torsades</b> de pointes revert to normal sinus rhythm within a few seconds; however, episodes may also persist and possibly degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, leading to sudden death {{in the absence of}} prompt medical intervention. <b>Torsades</b> de pointes is associated with long QT syndrome, a condition whereby prolonged QT intervals are visible on an ECG. Long QT intervals predispose the patient to an , wherein the R-wave, representing ventricular depolarization, occurs during the relative refractory period at the end of repolarization (represented by {{the latter half of the}} T-wave). An R-on-T can initiate <b>torsades.</b> Sometimes, pathologic T-U waves may be seen in the ECG before the initiation of <b>torsades.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Torsades de pointes or <b>torsade</b> depointes (TdP {{or simply}} torsade(s)) ( [...] , {{translated}} as [...] "twisting of the points"), {{is a specific}} type of abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac death. It is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that exhibits distinct characteristics on the electrocardiogram (ECG). It was described by Dessertenne in 1966. Prolongation of the QT interval can increase a person's risk of developing this abnormal heart rhythm.|$|E
50|$|Rhythm {{discrimination}} {{will see}} how regular a ventricular tachycardia is. Generally, ventricular tachycardia is regular.

50|$|AZD 1305 also acts on voltage gated sodium {{channels}} (Nav1.5) by attenuating {{the peak}} (INapeak) and late sodium current (INalate), though the latter current is more potently inhibited. Attenuation of INalate by AZD1305 is concentration-dependant and decreases {{the slope of}} depolarization and delays repolarization. INalate blockade by AZD1305 depressed the threshold of sodium channel excitation and prolongs APD. Blockade of IKr may lead to excessive prolongation of APD and repolarization instability, which may promote arrhythmic conditions in the heart, including EAD and <b>Torsade</b> de Pointes(TdP). Under IKr blockade a pronounced INalate {{can contribute to the}} development of arrhythmias by increasing repolarization variability. AZD1305 blockade of the INalate modulates IKr-blockade induced APD instability, repolarization vulnerability, and variability in beat-to-beat APD.|$|E
50|$|In rare cases, the QT {{prolongation}} {{caused by}} sotalol {{can lead to}} the development of life-threatening <b>torsade</b> de pointes (TdP) ventricular tachycardia. Across several trials, 0.6% of oral sotalol patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation) developed TdP. For patients who had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure. The incidence of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80 mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160 mg, 1.6% at 320 mg, 4.4% at 480 mg, 3.7% at 640 mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640 mg.
