5|$|After the war, 53,000 Belgian {{citizens}} (0.6 {{percent of}} the population) were found guilty of collaboration, providing the only estimate of the number involved during the period. Around 15,000 Belgians served in two separate divisions of the Waffen-SS, divided along linguistic lines. In particular, many Belgians were persuaded <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> occupiers {{as a result of}} long-running hostility to Communism, particularly after the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.|$|E

5|$|A New Zealander, Aaron Saxton's {{parents were}} Scientologists. Saxton's father {{committed}} suicide {{when he was}} 14, and this {{had a significant impact}} on him. At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organisation. After joining Scientology staff, Saxton moved <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> organisation in Sydney, Australia. Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|After {{a dispute}} over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son Ziggy is charged {{with the murder of}} one of the Greek's underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of a}} road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> turnpike commission to study {{ways to reduce the}} traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they can}} {{reconcile}} she dies in a viral outbreak {{initiated by the}} group, {{who are trying to}} bring {{about the end of the}} world, and Black returns to the FBI to pursue them. With his new partner, Emma Hollis, he finds himself struggling against the group's influence. Black is framed for the death of a fellow agent, prompting his resignation from the FBI and flight with Jordan to Washington D.C., and Hollis abandons him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group. Several years later, Black works with FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to foil a last-ditch effort by the group to orchestrate the end of the world; vindicated, he reunites with Jordan after the case.|$|E
