5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> had attempted to abort the landing and take off again. The co-pilot Ahluwalia had warned his commander three times to go around instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the runway threshold.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed, along with different deicing equipment and techniques.

5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} burns. On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position, possibly indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, McEntire {{confirmed}} on her {{website that}} ABC had ordered a pilot for her second television series, Malibu Country. McEntire {{would play a}} divorced mother of two who moves to Malibu, California to restart her music career. The pilot was filmed in April 2012 and began production on its first season in August. It was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> for Malibu Country would premiere November 2, 2012. The show was broadcast Friday nights at 8:30/7:30c on ABC. On May 11, 2012, McEntire tweeted that the show had been picked up. She also was the host in the 2011 NASCAR Award Show in Las Vegas.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.|$|E
5|$|About 14:00 on 9 April, two Staffeln of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 {{fighters from}} II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 were {{observed}} heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed to overshoot and climbed to meet them, {{but the other}} was unable to, and had to complete its landing. Podnarednik (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment scrambled to meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, a furious dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> survived. Podnarednik Stikić survived {{the loss of his}} IK-2, but was badly wounded. The Germans, low on fuel, broke off and headed north.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1951, Sydney {{was part}} of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of Australia's Federation. Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the exercise, a Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by Sydneys radio aerials could trigger a Fury's firing circuits. Sydney was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|Crash {{investigators}} determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> of Flight 725 didn't use the checklists {{prior to}} departure. During climbout, <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> became {{confused about what}} heading to take during a standard instrument departure. Spatial disorientation {{was believed to be}} one factor in the crash of Flight 725.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{investigation}} found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> descended below <b>the</b> minimum prescribed altitude. This {{was due to}} incorrect information on the outdated flight plan and/or due to a misreading of the weather radar which led <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> to believe they were closer to Dubai than they actually were.|$|R
5000|$|... 149° Gruppo flew many {{missions}} {{over the}} Adriatic, and to Ethiopia, despite <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> were convinced <b>that</b> given <b>the</b> strong, contrary winds, the slow SM.82s {{would be unable}} to return to Libya.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
5|$|Tube Alloys {{made its}} {{greatest}} advances in gaseous diffusion technology, and Chadwick had originally hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> plant at least {{would be built}} in Britain. Gaseous diffusion technology was devised by Simon and three expatriates, Nicholas Kurti from Hungary, Heinrich Kuhn from Germany, and Henry Arms from the United States, at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment, two two-stage models and two ten-stage models, was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers {{at a cost of}} £150,000 for the four units. Two single-stage machines were later added. Delays in delivery meant that experiments with the single-stage machine did not commence until June 1943, and with the two-stage machine until August 1943. The two ten-stage machines were delivered in August and November 1943, but by this time the research programme they had been built for had been overtaken by events.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> had throttled back {{a moment before}} impact and that his engines had been running normally up to that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flew too low whilst trying to descend out of icing conditions. A navigational error may also {{have contributed to the}} accident.|$|E
