25|$|The first prototype, {{powered by}} a 230hp (172kW) RAF 3 V12 engine driving a {{four-bladed}} propeller was completed at Farnborough late in 1917, being sent to Hamble near Southampton for final assembly and initial flight testing on 25 December. The C.E.1 made its maiden flight, piloted by its designer, on 17 January 1918. After modifications to its controls it {{was sent to the}} Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain for service trials in April, being quickly followed by the second prototype, which was {{powered by a}} 260hp (190kW) Sunbeam Maori engine. Trials showed that the C.E.1 was inferior to the larger and moree powerful twin-engine Felixstowe flying boats, and no production followed, the two prototypes being used for hydrodynamic experiments to validate test data obtained from model tests in a <b>test</b> <b>tank</b> at the National Physical Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ALT test flight program, on March 13, 1978, Enterprise was flown once again, but this time halfway across the country to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama for the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Testing (MGVT). The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the Dynamic Test Stand building, and there mated to the Vertical Mate Ground Vibration <b>Test</b> <b>tank</b> (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked {{the first time in the}} program's history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together. During the course of the program, Enterprise and the rest of the launch stack would be exposed to a punishing series of vibration tests simulating as closely as possible those expected during various phases of launch, some tests with and others without the SRBs in place.|$|E

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the beneficial roles of Nannochloropsis oculata in larval rearing of marine finfish Masanori OKAUCHI* Abstract From points of both water quality management by algal nutrient absorption and a good live food of rotifer, the role of Nannochloropsis oculata supplied to larval rearing water was examined by a larval rearing experiment in this study. Larvae of Japanese red sea bream, Pagrus major, were reared being fed rotifers and subsequently an artificial diet during the thirty-day experimental period. In the four <b>test</b> <b>tanks</b> (100 -L capacity) each with 1, 000 Japanese red sea bream larvae {{in addition to the}} rotifers, N. oculata was maintained at a density of 5 - 10 × 105 cells/mL while in the four control tanks, no N. oculata supplemented, but all the other experimental conditions were the same as the <b>test</b> <b>tanks.</b> At the end of the experiment, the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (NH 4 -N, NO 2 -N, and NO 3 -N) and inorganic phosphate (PO 4 -P) in the control tanks were 1. 5 - 2. 0 times higher than those in the <b>test</b> <b>tanks.</b> While, the number of rotifers with eggs in the <b>test</b> <b>tanks</b> was remarkably higher in comparison with that in the control tanks. Moreover, rotifers in the <b>test</b> <b>tanks</b> contained much more eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and n- 3 highly unsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 HUFA), so that their nutrient value is concluded as higher than that in the control tanks. From the results of this experiment, supplemen-tation with N. oculata into the rearing water is concluded to produce beneficial effects on maintaining water quality and also enhancing the nutrient quality of the rotifers...|$|R

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor <b>test</b> <b>tank</b> at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multitasking electrical impedance tomography (EIT) {{system designed to}} improve the flexibility and durability of an existing EIT system. The ability of the present EIT system to detect, locate, and reshape objects was evaluated by four different experiments.
