5|$|Major {{pieces were}} created at Crawfords Casting foundry in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the foundry would {{fabricate}} {{the elements of}} <b>the</b> <b>sculptures,</b> Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training foundry staff and supervising their activity. Some of the pieces assembled to create <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual pieces would take up to two months to complete.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 sculptures {{depicting}} {{scenes from}} Chicago's history {{were added to}} the outward-facing walls of the four bridgehouses. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> on the northern bridgehouses were commissioned by William Wrigley, Jr., and are by James Earle Fraser: The Discoverers depicts Louis Joliet, Jacques Marquette, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti; The Pioneers depicts John Kinzie leading a group through the wilderness. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> on the southern bridgehouses were commissioned by the B. F. Ferguson Monument Fund, and are by Henry Hering: Defense depicts Ensign George Ronan in a scene from the 1812 Battle of Fort Dearborn; Regeneration depicts workers rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.|$|E
5000|$|On May 25, 1954, Abbott Pattison {{initially}} placed <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> at Reed Hall in the University of Georgia. However, after <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was vandalized by disgruntled students, <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> {{was secretly}} {{moved to a}} warehouse. It remained there before horticulture professor L.C. Curtis moved it to his farm near Watkinsville, Georgia in 1959 where it stands today. In an interview with The New York Times in 1979, Curtis claimed that he wanted <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> from Lamar Dodd, {{the chairman of the}} art department at the time, because [...] "I collect conversation pieces. I'm {{a little bit of an}} eccentric." [...] Although <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was possessed by Curtis' descendant, Jack Curtis, before his death, <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> is still owned by the university. In 2011, <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was vandalized once again. Afterwards, a secret group restored the horse. As of 2017, the farm where <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> is kept is managed by Josh Griffin.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> {{was led by}} the artist who raised the $20,000 needed to create <b>the</b> <b>sculpture,</b> which he began in August 1974. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> was accepted {{as a gift to}} the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority on August 5, 1975 from Jerry Sanders. Sanders created <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> from donated materials, which was finally painted by Indiana Waterproofing and Protective Coating Company. The base for <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was poured by Irwin Materials Company and the uplighting completed by the Commonwealth Electric Company.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{and thus}} {{atypical}} of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> {{in the park}} is the bronze statue of the artist Heinrich Zille, which was created in 196465 by Heinrich Drake for an exhibition in the Treptower Park and afterwards moved to Köllnischer Park. It is listed as a landmark by the City of Berlin.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> on {{the west}} front at Wells include {{standing}} figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures {{and many of the}} architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} budget, the {{restoration}} had been primarily focused on cleaning <b>the</b> <b>sculptures,</b> and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration. Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported {{into the rest of}} the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> was {{inspected}} in 1992 {{as part of}} <b>the</b> Save Outdoor <b>Sculpture!</b> (SOS!) {{program and}} an on-line record http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!309310~!0#focus {{was created in the}} Smithsonian Institution Research Information System (SIRIS). The black-and-white image, taken around the time of that inspection, shows <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> no longer having the even, dark patina that <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> had when it was unveiled in 1932. Likewise, Greiff's 2005 publication shows <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> with a similar appearance.|$|R

5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, lacquer and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E
5|$|During the Song period Buddhism {{saw a small}} revival {{since its}} {{persecution}} during the Tang dynasty. This {{could be seen in}} the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province. Similar in design to <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> at Dazu, the Song temple at Mingshan in Anyue, Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures, including the Buddha and deities clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months, the city {{regularly}} hosts WaterFire, an environmental art installation {{that consists of}} about 100 bonfires which blaze just above {{the surface of the}} three rivers that pass through the middle of downtown Providence.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> is {{a collage}} of brass wind {{instruments}} welded together and arranged in a square column. Instruments consist of saxophones, sousaphones, trombones, trumpets, and tubas. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> sits in a fountain basin, which has non-chlorinated running water and illumination for <b>the</b> <b>sculpture.</b> <b>The</b> fountain basin is a large trapezoidal shape and <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> is set in its most central point.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> has two posts {{that rise}} at non-parallel angles. The posts appear to rise {{straightly}} until they individually curl and twist before {{meeting at the}} highest point of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> is lit constantly, and with varying colors and light patterns at different periods of <b>the</b> year. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> is geometric but {{does not seem to}} form any strictly right angles. From each angle surrounding <b>the</b> <b>sculpture,</b> <b>the</b> shape at the top appears to be from a different sculpture. Interestingly enough due to the location, the one perspective that is often inaccessible is that right under <b>the</b> <b>sculpture,</b> as it is located on a rotary island in a busy traffic intersection.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the church's history after its construction. The {{building}} survived until the 11th century, after which it fell into decay, while several architectural elements were removed and reused in Constantinople and other cities. After being built over in the Ottoman period, {{the site of the}} church was rediscovered during excavations in the 1960s. The area, directly opposite the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality City Hall, is now a preserved archaeological site open to visitors, although <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> have been removed to the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream Indian {{cultural}} elements {{coexist with}} traditional {{practices of the}} ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> at the archaeological sites Unakoti, Pilak and Devtamura provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and tribal religions. The Great Chinmoy in Agartala was the former royal abode of the Tripuri king.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the human}} race become extinct, then the various {{features}} assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.|$|E

5|$|The Gateway Foundation already owned {{two of the}} {{two dozen}} pieces prior to Citygarden's creation, and it {{purchased}} the remaining number between 2006 and 2009. The organization has not revealed the cost of acquiring <b>the</b> <b>sculptures,</b> an amount {{not included in the}} $30 million; however, it is estimated that the collection is worth around $12 million, if not more. The garden has received criticism from those who think that 24 sculptures is too many in such a small space.|$|E
5|$|The {{fair amount}} of {{isolated}} fragments and sculptures testify to the many lost works and those that reached us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit. None of these are mentioned in archival documents, apart from <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> that accompanied the Caprioli Adoration. On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been completely lost.|$|E
5|$|The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar in eleven hymns and Thirumangai Azhwar in {{thirteen}} hymns. The temple {{is classified}} as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Some of the ancient Sanskrit books consider the temple as a uthamakshetram, meaning the place that gives the best to its devotees. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> on the pillars of the temple reveal the earliest practice of Krishna worship in Tamil Nadu.|$|E

5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E
