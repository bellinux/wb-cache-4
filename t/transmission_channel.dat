30|$|In this manuscript, the {{proposed}} models are improved by considering that <b>transmission</b> <b>channels</b> are dynamic channels {{that can be}} modeled as non-stationary variables. It is worth mentioning that for antennas mounted on moving vehicles or drones, the <b>transmission</b> <b>channels</b> can be approximated by almost static or slowly evolutionary dynamic channels over certain periods. The transition among these periods can be very fast. In addition, during two adjacent periods, <b>transmission</b> <b>channels</b> can have completely different statistical properties and/or PDFs. This scenario illustrates a typical scenario of a mobile phone used in a moving car which is moving among big buildings in a modern city. It can represent as well the scenario of a drone flying at low altitude in a mountainous area.|$|R
