25|$|The guitar was {{extensively}} {{modified by}} Gallagher. The tuning pegs are odd (5 Sperzel pegs and one Gotoh), {{and all of}} these {{have been found to be}} replacements. Second, it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times. Third, the pickguard was changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Irwin {{completed}} Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar. It {{was similar}} to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a <b>tone</b> <b>control,</b> while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the MIDI effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording Without a Net. Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to 11½ pounds. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a rose, covers a plate just below the bridge. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000.|$|E
50|$|Vereker {{believed}} that a properly designed amplifier would not need <b>tone</b> <b>controls,</b> since these filters were often palliatives for poor design. He contended that <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> represented a cost of manufacture yet were detrimental to sound quality. Therefore, starting with the NAC 12, Naim amplifiers have never featured the <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> that were popular elsewhere in the industry.|$|R

500|$|The {{amplifier}} {{has what}} the manufacturer calls a [...] "dual-mode power supply", where the output stage is only loosely regulated, {{so it is}} free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low-impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry. The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit, fed from a secondary winding on the transformer, dedicated to the pre-amplifier and <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> stages. It is thus claimed that intermodulation distortion and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur.|$|E
500|$|A first-person meal {{simulator}} {{was designed}} for Thirty Flights of Loving. The sequence included the main characters [...] "enjoy street noddles." [...] However, the idea was scrapped and replaced with the motorcycle ride featured in the final version. The gunfight scene portrayed in the game {{was supposed to have}} a [...] "musical rhythm," [...] inspired by the film Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. The last level of the game is modeled from the French National Museum of Natural History. Chung explained that when developing levels, he first spends time researching and [...] "learning how things work." [...] He elaborated that researching is important in [...] "how it gives specificity and grounding" [...] to a game. Thirty Flights of Loving is the seventh [...] "Citizen Abel" [...] game developed by Chung. The first two games were coded in 1999, while the following three were written between 2000 and 2004. The sixth game in the series, Gravity Bone (2008), became the first to be published. On the <b>Tone</b> <b>Control</b> podcast, he spoke about how every game he has produced, including Thirty Flights of Loving, takes place in the same shared universe.|$|E
2500|$|Tube enthusiasts {{believe that}} tube amps produce a [...] "warmer" [...] sound {{and a more}} natural [...] "overdrive" [...] sound. Typically, tube amps use one or more dual triodes in the {{preamplifier}} section to provide sufficient voltage gain to offset <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> losses and drive the power amplifier section. While tube technology is, in many ways, outdated, tube amps remain popular since many guitarists prefer their sound.|$|E

5000|$|The Marshall Major (Model 1967 [...] ) was {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} made by Marshall. It {{was introduced in}} 1967 as the [...] "Marshall 200" [...] (in reference to the wattage of the amplifier). It had a plexi panel and two inputs in one channel, but {{in contrast with the}} 100 watt heads made by Marshall, the first series had split <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> similar to the Sound City amps. For the second series, in late 1968, Marshall reverted to ordinary passive <b>tone</b> <b>controls,</b> and was called [...] "Marshall Major". Some authors claim the first version had active <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> but this is incorrect, the schematics for all versions are available online.|$|R

2500|$|Gibson used {{hundreds}} {{of photographs of}} the late blues guitarist's instrument to produce the limited-edition Bloomfield signature. The company produced one hundred Bloomfield models with custom-aged finishes and two hundred more with the company's VOS finishing in 2009. They reproduced the tailpiece crack on the aged version, plus the mismatched volume and <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> knobs and the [...] "Les Paul"-engraved truss rod cover on both versions, while including a toggle switch cover. The headstock was characterized by the kidney-shaped Grover tuning keys installed on the guitar before Bloomfield traded for it.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{during his}} stint in Cream, Clapton's first Les Paul Standard was stolen. He {{continued}} to play Les Pauls exclusively with Cream (one bought from Andy Summers was almost identical to the stolen guitar) until 1967, when he acquired his most famous guitar in this period, a 1964 Gibson SG, dubbed [...] "the Fool". Clapton used both the Les Paul and the SG to create his self-described [...] "woman tone". [...] He explained in a 1967 interview, [...] "I am playing more smoothly now. I’m developing what I call my 'woman tone.' It's a sweet sound, something like the solo on 'I Feel Free'." [...] Writer Michael Dregni describes it as [...] "thick yet piercing, overdriven yet smooth, distorted yet creamy". [...] The tone is achieved {{by a combination of}} <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> settings on the guitars and Clapton's Marshall JTM45 amplifier. [...] Vintage Guitar magazine identifies [...] "the opening riff and solo of 'Sunshine of Your Love' are arguably the best illustrations of full-blown woman tone". [...] Clapton's [...] "Fool" [...] acquired its name from its distinctive psychedelic paint job, created by the visual art collective also known as the Fool (just before Cream's first US appearance in 1967, Clapton's SG, Bruce's Fender VI, and Baker's drum head were all repainted in psychedelic designs).|$|E
50|$|In 1952 {{the pickup}} {{selection}} circuit was modified by Fender to incorporate a real <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> Between 1953 and 1967 the neck could be selected {{alone with a}} pre-set bassy sound and no <b>tone</b> <b>control,</b> in the middle switch the neck could be selected alone with the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> and finally the bridge could be selected with the <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> Although this provided the player with a proper <b>tone</b> <b>control,</b> this assembly did away with any sort of pickup combination. Eventually from late 1967 Fender again modified the circuit for the final time to give the Telecaster a more traditional twin pickup switching system: neck pickup alone with <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> in the first position, both pickups together with the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> in the middle position and in the third position the bridge pickup alone with the <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

30|$|Pickup {{signals are}} fed to the {{amplifier}} section, {{which also includes}} <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> and a volume potentiometer. The amplifier schematic is publicly available [36], {{and it has been}} used to gather a basic understanding of its functioning. Some of the components, such as the <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> and the transistors, have been isolated to conduct simulations and obtain an estimate of the frequency response by means of an electric circuit simulator.|$|R
50|$|Most Cabronitas {{have two}} pickups {{but do not}} have a <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> This is another first for the Telecaster. A <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> can be added {{aftermarket}} by using a stacked potentiometer, but many argue that dropping the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> gives the instrument a bit more sparkle and highs in the tone, as a <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> filters some of the higher frequencies even when set to the highest level.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> was {{achieved}} via analog electronics, and most <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuits produced today still use the analog process.

50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> is {{a single}} knob that when turned in one direction enhances treble frequencies and the other direction enhances bass frequencies.

50|$|In the 1920s, the {{earliest}} combo amplifiers {{did not have}} any <b>tone</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>controls</b> on early guitar amplifiers were very simple and provided a great deal of treble boost, but the limited controls, the loudspeakers used, and the low power of the amplifiers (typically 15 watts or less prior to the mid-1950s) gave poor high treble and bass output. This made these early amplifier/speaker systems a poor way for upright bass players to amplify the sound of their instruments.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>control</b> is {{also used}} to adjust an audio signal during recording. For instance, if the {{acoustics}} of the recording site cause it to absorb some frequencies more than others, <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> can be used to amplify or [...] "boost" [...] the frequencies the room dampens.|$|E
5000|$|In {{their most}} basic form, <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> {{circuits}} attenuate the {{high or low}} frequencies of the signal. This is called treble or bass [...] "cut". The simplest <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuits are passive circuits which utilize only resistors and capacitors or inductors. They rely on the property of capacitive reactance or inductive reactance to inhibit or enhance an AC signal, in a frequency-dependent manner. Active tone controls may also amplify or [...] "boost" [...] certain frequencies. More elaborate <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuits can boost or attenuate the middle range of frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 2004, all Custom Shop Clapton Stratocasters (Team Built and Master Built) used {{a standard}} <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> {{instead of a}} TBX tone circuit.

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of {{original}} SVT amps. The first are the [...] "blue line" [...] SVTs. These are called {{that because of the}} engraved blue text and lines that surround the <b>tone</b> <b>controls.</b> Early 1969-70 [...] "blue lines" [...] used 6146B beam power vacuum tubes. The 6146B proved to be unstable in the high-voltage amp, and was switched to the more robust and reliable 6550 tube around mid-1970. The second version of a vintage SVT is what is called the [...] "black line" [...] SVT. The lines and text are black instead of blue, and like the later run [...] "blue lines" [...] use 6550 power vacuum tubes instead of 6146Bs. Later 1970s models have the same features as the [...] "black line" [...] SVTs except the lines around the <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> have rounded corners and curve into the <b>tone</b> <b>controls.</b> They also came with 3-prong power cables, and no polarity switch.|$|R
