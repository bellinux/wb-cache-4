40|$|A resilient, flexible, pressure-activated, {{high-temperature}} seal {{is adapted}} to be interposed {{between high and low}} pressure regions to provide sealing between opposing surfaces of adjacent relatively movable structures. The seal comprises at least one C-shaped sheet element. The C-shaped element design enables the seal to be pressure-activated to provide a radially outward biasing force, responsive to a seal-activating pressure differential acting across the seal thereby increasing resiliency. A centrally-located, resilient core structure provides load bearing and insulating properties. In an exemplary embodiment where at least two seal elements are used, each layer has a cutout slot pattern and the remaining strip material pattern. The slots provide flexibility to the seal, enabling the seal to be manually contoured <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>around</b> corners and curves. The strip material of each layer covers the slots in each adjacent layer to minimize leakage through the slots. Attached barrier strips can block interface leakage between the seal and the opposing surfaces...|$|E

On each unit the harvester operator used joysticks to position and engage a rapid displacement actuator (RDA) on main scaffolds to effect fruit removal. Catching conveyors were designed to intercept falling fruit without damage and elevate the fruit to a collecting conveyor. Cushioned catcher pans on each unit were used <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>around</b> the trunk and connect the two units. Fruit removal was 95 % or better, and 86 to 95 % of all the fruit on the trees were recovered. Tests on eight cultivars of apples yielded 59 to 84 % Extra Fancy packout. Cuts and punctures were the biggest factor preventing the harvester from harvesting {{a higher level of}} fresh–market quality fruit. Stempulls with this harvesting technique ranged from 20 to 57 %, depending on cultivar, and may create a decay problem.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A two–unit {{mechanical}} harvester {{was developed to}} harvest fresh–market quality sweet cherries (Prunus avium L.). Units were essentially mirror images. On each unit the harvester operator used joysticks to position and engage a rapid displacement actuator (RDA) on main scaffolds to effect fruit removal. Catching conveyors were designed to intercept falling fruit without damage and elevate the fruit to a collecting conveyor. Cushioned catcher pans on each unit were used <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>around</b> the trunk and connect the two units. Main scaffolds were inclined to reduce damage as cherries fell to the catching surface. Ethrel (2 –chloroethyl phosphonic acid) was used to reduce the fruit retention force of mature cherries to enable removal without stems or damage. The experimental harvester demonstrated potential for harvesting stemless sweet cherries with fresh–market fruit quality comparable to commercial hand–picked cherries. The catching/collecting system was effective with low damage inflicted to the cherries. About 90 % of the cherries were remove from the tree and of those removed, 88 % were collected and containerized. These levels are expected to increase with proper tree training and appropriate sized catching surfaces. Harvest rate down–the–row ranged from 85 to 158 trees/h with harvester capacity up to 1590 kg/h (3500 lb/h) ...|$|E
40|$|Non-metallic, flexible, thin, {{microchannel}} {{heat exchangers}} made from heat-sealable polyimide films {{have recently been}} developed for refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. In order for these heat exchangers to function properly and independently, robust and reliable connectors are needed. The connectors must be easy to manufacture and assemble, hold high pressures without leaking, resist a pullout force, and {{have the ability to}} connect to standard tubing and piping and different heat exchangers together in series and parallel. Three uniquely different functional prototype connector designs have been developed, manufactured, and tested. The first includes a machined metal connector internally embedded within the heat exchanger that is capable of holding pressures up to 0. 83 MPa and 65. 5 N of pullout force before failure. The second connector design includes a two-piece polymer assembly containing an o-ring used <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>around</b> the inlet and outlet holes of the heat exchanger. The design incorporates a 10 -degree wedge that creates the sealing force when fully assembled with the heat exchanger and has been pressure tested to 1. 83 MPa without leaking and 73. 6 N of pullout force applied before failure. A variation of the design allows multiple heat exchangers to connect in series and in parallel. Finally, the third design contains no additional parts and connects two heat exchangers together by thermally bonding the inlet of one heat exchanger to the outlet of another. The thermally bonded connection was able to hold pressures greater than 2. 07 MPa. Finally, fatigue testing of the heat exchangers is conducted using an Instron machine to develop a stress amplitude versus number of cycles to failure diagram for the zero pressure case.

40|$|The blowout {{preventer}} system is acting the secondary safety barrier in a hydrocarbon well, where the drilling mud column {{is defined as}} the primary safety barrier. However, in pratical industry, there is a new demand for improved methods of assessing the reliability and availability of {{blowout preventer}} systems. The objective of this master thesis is to propose the relatively new method for reliability and availability assessment based on Bayesian Network, focusing on the comparsion between the various blowout preventers stack and the influence of the external information in the case study. The thesis starting with introduction of safety critical system including the basic terminology for reliability and availability assessment. The relevant standards regarding oil and gas industry are also introduced. The brief review about the blowout preventer is presented next. The basic structure of blowout preventer and the three main subsystems are identified and introduced. The classification of possible failure and desired functions of main components are reported. Finally, the brief research review about the previous reliability assessment method of subsea blowout preventer is presented, pointing out some potential weakness of the traditional methods, which indicating the Bayesian Network is the one possible solution when new requirement of reliability and availability is demanded. Then the introduction of Bayesian Network is mainly investigated for those who are not very familiar with this method. The possible allocation of Bayesian Network in reliability assessment and the comparsion between Bayesian Network model and the traditional method are mainly discussed. Then in the end of this chapter, there are two examples to show how the traditional method used in the assessment of blowout preventer can be transferred into Bayesian Network model without losing any details, in addtion, the advanced modeling powers regarding introduction of probabilistic gates, multiple states for variables and updating information when scanerio is known are revealed in both examples. Finally the case study about reliability and availability assessment of different blowout preventers is created. There are mainly three different type of blowout preventer stacks withing different degrees of performing the desired functions under the most demanding situations. The Bayesian Network model is able to perform such assessment effectively and one addtional information is taken into account since the contribution of the wellbore pressure has significant implications on the blowout preventer's ability <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>around</b> or seal off the wellbore. Finally, the conclusion and discussion are provided. The main conclusion are summarized as three key findings. First, Bayesian Network is proven to carry out the reliability and availability assessment when there is the new requirement in pratical situations, especially for updating the information when the test data is available during the operation. Second, Bayesian Network based reliability and availability assessment is possible for applying in the large scale model since it can handle probabilistic gates and multiple states of components, where the traditional method such as Fault Tree Analysis {{may not be able to}} deal with such challenges. Third, according to the analysis results of the case study, the blowout preventer equipped with the Deepwater Horizon type of stack is considered as the most reliable one in the most demanding situation, if the correct repair strategy is applied. In addition, this kind of blowout preventer is relatively very stable under the high wellbore pressure condition even though withing lower redundancy of the pipe ram subsystem, due to inclusion of casing shear ram which improves the shearing ability significantly...|$|E

40|$|This {{suggests}} that the primary role for cIAP- 1 and cIAP- 2 is to block caspase 8 activation. It also verifies a previous proposal that cIAPs act downstream of NF-B during its cell survival pathway (25, 26). NF-B signaling is insufficient to block the onset of apoptosis {{in the presence of}} Smac or compound 3. The ability of compound 3 to potentiate apoptosis in TNF-treated cells, despite NF-B activa-tion, suggests a strategy for treating inflam-matory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNF functions in RA by inducing secretion of matrix-degrading proteases and multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemo-kines and increased expression of class I major histocompatibility molecules by syno-vial fibroblasts (leading to cartilage and bone erosion) and synovial neoangiogenesis (27). Moreover, it stimulates adhesion molecules on the surface of vascular endothelial cells to recruit circulating leukocytes to the endothe-lium and activates multinucleated osteoclasts <b>to</b> form a <b>seal</b> <b>around</b> bone, where they cause erosion by acidic secretions and protease ac-tivity (28).
