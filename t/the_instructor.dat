40|$|Speaking English is an {{important}} skill in language learning. The learners communicate through oral expression to gain much information effectively and efficiently. The teacher {{should be aware of}} the learners’ speaking ability because it significantly influences the other learners’ success in language learning. The ability to speak a foreign language becomes the most highly prized language skill. Many language learners regard speaking skill as the measure of knowing a language. 	This research was meant to investigate the teaching of English speaking skill at “First Course”: a boarding course in Bangkalan. This research is a descriptive case study of First Course. The subject of this research is two <b>instructors</b> who teach <b>the</b> book two level at First Course. The major research question of this study is: how is the process of the teaching of English speaking skill at First Course which is broken down into two sub research questions: 1) How is the preparation of the teaching of English speaking skill at First Course? 2) How is the implementation of the preparation on the teaching of English speaking skill at First Course? 	The data of this research was the information that researcher collected from the result of interview with two instructors and classroom observation. The researcher collected the data by using interview guide, observation sheet, and fieldnote. The information was in the form of the interview transcript and classroom observation (field note). The analysis of the research data resulted in several findings: 	Firstly, the result of interview concerning the preparation of the teaching of English speaking skill: (1) <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> did not use lesson plan in written form. Yet, <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> kept <b>the</b> unwritten plan in their mind. (2) Material and media prepared by <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> were soft copy, hard copy and coursebook (English 900 by Collier Macmillan). Then, the media used for teaching speaking were pictures, cards, dictionary, microphone, and internet. (3) The teaching techniques used to deliver the materials in teaching speaking were storytelling, question and answer, discussion, describing, debating, and interviewing. (4) The form of assessment and evaluation provided by instructors was an oral test through storytelling, question and answer and interview. (5) The form of assignment provided by <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> was an oral assignment at the end of the class. Secondly, the result of observations concerning the implementation of the preparation on the teaching of English speaking skill: (1) <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> did not used lesson plan in written form. Yet, they kept the unwritten plan in their mind. To reflect that they made a preparation in their mind, they presented the teaching-learning activities consistently. Their teaching contains three major parts: firstly, pre-teaching. <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> started <b>the</b> lesson by praying together. Then, they greeted the students, gave some motivation, and reviewed the previous lesson. Afterwards, they introduced the new topic. Secondly, whilst-teaching. <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> invited <b>the</b> students to tell a story, made question and answer, and have an interview. Thirdly, post teaching. They gave an oral assignment to the students at the end of the lesson. Then, they closed the lesson by praying. (2) The material and media prepared by <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> was a coursebook (English 900 by Collier Macmillan). The media used for teaching was microphone. (3) The teaching techniques used to deliver the materials were storytelling, question and answer, and interview. (4) The form of assessment and evaluation provided by <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> was an oral test. <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> asked <b>the</b> students to tell a story, make question and answer, and have an interview. (5) The form of assignment provided by <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> was an oral assignment. <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> asked <b>the</b> students to tell a story, make question and answer, and have an interview on the following meeting. <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> not only taught English speaking to the students but also improved morality, trained and strengthened spirit, appreciated the spiritual/religious values, and taught attitude, politeness, discipline, diligence, honesty, responsibility, democratic, work hard, etc. <b>The</b> <b>instructors</b> had a role in build of students’ characters. The character education which was provided by <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> were memorized and followed by all the students.

5|$|Although {{considered}} an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his Royal Aero Club certificate (no.1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested {{transfer to the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was seconded to No.9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC on 23 October, and trained at Mousehold Heath aerodrome near Norwich. In {{the first week of}} December, he soloed in a Maurice Farman Longhorn after standing duty all night, and his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. <b>The</b> <b>instructor</b> relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at Central Flying School, Upavon, and was awarded his wings on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E

French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon.
