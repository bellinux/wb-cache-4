25|$|This {{school was}} opened in 1970 {{but it was}} not until the mid-to-late 1970s that it was {{enlarged}} to become the junior school. Until then, the two Histon and Impington schools had the same head teacher, who had to cycle from school <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression, John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer's Crossing, [...] from Hattiesburg, where he worked at a turpentine factory until he was laid off in 1938. John Brown then moved the family to Lux, Mississippi, {{to be a part of}} a sharecropper farm. During this time, Jesse Brown shared a bed with his brothers and attended a one-room school [...] away. His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework, and Jesse Brown walked <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse, William, and Julia Brown sang in the church choir. In his spare time, Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton.|$|E

2500|$|Bulah v. Gebhart {{was brought}} by Sarah Bulah, a {{resident}} of the rural town of Hockessin, Delaware. [...] Mrs. Bulah's daughter, Shirley, had been denied admission to the modern, whites-only Hockessin School No. 29, and instead was compelled to attend a one-room [...] "colored" [...] school, Hockessin School No. 107, which, though very near School No. 29, had vastly inferior facilities and construction. [...] Moreover, Shirley Bulah was required to walk <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> even though a school bus serving the nearby whites-only school passed by her house every day. [...] Mrs. Bulah had attempted to obtain transportation for Shirley on that bus, but she was told they would never transport an African-American student.|$|E
60|$|We {{are looking}} for some of you here next week {{to go to the}} fair. I wrote to Simpson to come down and see me but as I have had no answer from him nor from Orvil to a letter written some time before, I do not know whether he will come or not. I should like very much to have some of you come and see us this fall. Julia and the {{children}} are all very well. Fred and Buck go <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> They never think of asking to stay at home.|$|E
60|$|The male {{heads of}} the {{families}} were necessarily drawn into the quarrel, and the children on either side were forbidden {{to have anything to}} do with the unhallowed offspring of the other party. As they had to travel a good three miles along the same road <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> this was awkward, but such things have to be. Thus all communication between the households was sundered. Except the cats. Much as Mrs. Saunders might deplore it, rumour persistently pointed to the Crick he-cat as the presumable father of sundry kittens of which the Saunders she-cat was indisputably the mother. Mrs. Saunders drowned the kittens, but the disgrace remained.|$|E
50|$|Though {{he looks}} like a delinquent, {{surprisingly}} he comes <b>to</b> <b>school</b> on time <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Only once in chapter 11 was when he actually skipped school.|$|R
50|$|The {{tracks were}} owned by Burlington Northern Railway and were used mainly by Canadian National Railways to move cars between its yard and the Vancouver waterfront. About 400 {{children}} crossed the tracks <b>to</b> and from <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
25|$|The town's {{teachers}} were also {{placed in a}} difficult position. They were forced to swear loyalty to Faubus's bills. Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, the {{teachers were}} still expected <b>to</b> attend <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> and prepare {{for the possibility of}} their students' return. The teachers were completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.|$|R

50|$|Boys {{and girls}} dormitories were built so that {{children}} who lived ten miles away {{did not have to}} walk <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> This improvement also helped to ensure that the children attended school on a regular basis.|$|E
5000|$|His mother, Anne Elisabeth Honorine Aubert (1814-1897), was [...] "vivacious and romantic, but {{quick to}} take offence". It was from her that Cézanne got his {{conception}} and vision of life. He also had two younger sisters, Marie and Rose, {{with whom he}} went <b>to</b> a primary <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The winter weeks slipped by. It was {{an unusually}} mild winter, {{with so little}} snow that Anne and Diana could go <b>to</b> <b>school</b> nearly <b>every</b> <b>day</b> {{by way of the}} Birch Path. On Anne's {{birthday}} they were tripping lightly down it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss Stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on [...] "A Winter's Walk in the Woods," [...] and it behooved them to be observant.|$|R
25|$|The murders {{shocked the}} city. Worried parents formed escort groups to take {{children}} <b>to</b> and from <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> and <b>to</b> patrol streets {{at night and}} on weekends. The Washington Post called the murders of Kendrick and Bradley {{two of the four}} most shocking murders in the city during 1973.|$|R

5000|$|Increased {{attendance}} - Children {{look forward}} to coming <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> because of the mid-day meal. As the Akshaya Patra meal caters to the regional palate it further suits the taste buds {{of the children and}} draws them to attend school.|$|E

5000|$|The school {{attracted}} the attention {{of a wide range of}} intellectuals. The children came from parents with an academic or professional background who had, in many cases, already achieved eminence in their fields. They included two sons of G. E. Moore (Cambridge philosopher and ethicist), the daughter of Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian (neurophysiologist, nobel laureate), Philip Sargant Florence (post-graduate student and later Professor of Economics). Yvonne Kapp, who described Pyke as [...] "an intimate if entirely unpredictable friend" [...] took her children <b>to</b> the <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kuk Po {{boasts a}} rural school house. It {{was built in}} the 1928, {{inspired}} by the Guangzhou Military Academy School, and is firmly connected with Sung Miau On, who became the local Kuk Po school headmaster. Sung Miao On was not originally from Kuk Po, but had studied in Guangzhou at the Military Academy <b>School.</b> He came <b>to</b> Kuk Po and identified with the people there who were of the same clan as he was. The school was still in use until the early 1990s, with the last headmaster Mr. Ho and a couple of teachers, and a few children who travelled across the bay <b>to</b> attend <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R

[...] Kéfera Buchmann ...|$|R

50|$|Chandler instituted an {{integrated}} technology curriculum in 2005 requiring each Middle School student {{to bring a}} personal laptop <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> This allows for technology education {{to be part of}} the regular curriculum, instead of an independent component, better reflecting recent trends in higher education and professional technology usage.|$|E

One rainy afternoon while playing chess in Jeremy's room, Susan and Jeremy profess their love for each other and then make love for the first time.|$|R
50|$|High school {{freshman}} Airi Hoshina's only ambition {{in life is}} to someday live in a cozy {{home with}} a loving husband and find joy in the little things in life. She revolves all her activities and hobbies around this concept including getting <b>to</b> <b>school</b> on time <b>every</b> <b>day</b> because the <b>school</b> legend says that the longer one's non-tardy streak is, the better boyfriend one will find.|$|R
50|$|Oban has {{a primary}} school campus {{located in the}} south of the town along with Park Primary School at the north of the town, and a major high school, Oban High School.

The school funds the hostel so that the families of the students don't have to pay themselves.|$|R

His parents {{divorced}} when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi {{with his mother and}} maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: [...] "He would walk me <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>every</b> single <b>day.</b> He would talk to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me." [...] His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} in 1901 was 98. By 1951 there were 41 inhabitants. There {{are only two}} remaining residents of Cranoe who remember it in its former glory, one of whom {{used to live in}} Glooston, and used <b>to</b> walk <b>to</b> <b>school</b> in Cranoe <b>every</b> <b>day</b> before it was closed in favour of Hallaton C of E school. By rights Cranoe should be classed as a hamlet if it were rated on the number of houses and residents; however the survival of the parish church of St Michael means that it retains status as a village.|$|R
50|$|Ramona {{feels the}} best part of being in third grade is Sustained Silent Reading. Ramona loves getting time <b>to</b> read in <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> The worst part is that she isn't sure if her teacher, Mrs. Whaley, likes her. When Ramona cracks a hard boiled egg on her head at lunch—and finds out her mother forgot to boil it—she ends up in the secretary's office with a head full of raw egg, where she overhears Mrs. Whaley {{describe}} her as a show-off and a nuisance. Even Yard Ape can't make her feel better about that. Things get worse when she throws up in class and her mother has to leave work to take her home.|$|R
