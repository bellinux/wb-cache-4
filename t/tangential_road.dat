50|$|Alsheim lies {{right on}} Bundesstraße 9, {{on the main}} Worms-Mainz <b>tangential</b> <b>road.</b> Reachable {{within a few minutes}} are the Autobahnen A 63 through the Biebelnheim {{interchange}} and A 61 through the Worms/Mörrstadt or Gundersheim interchange.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s {{a number}} of housing estates were {{developed}} in Marzahn that called also for high-performance road links. The Landsberger Allee (Landsberg Avenue) and Frankfurter Allee (Frankfurt Avenue) were expanded to six lanes (four lanes on the outer sections) working as radial roads connecting to the Berlin city center while the Märkische Allee (Northmarch Avenue) was newly constructed as the <b>tangential</b> <b>road</b> running north-south along the new boroughs. This part was finished around 1975.|$|E
50|$|Forces {{occurring}} {{between the}} motorcycle {{and the road}} (such as those that result in accelerating, decelerating and turning) occur at the contact patch through friction and normal forces. There is {{a limited amount of}} force <b>tangential</b> to the <b>road</b> that the contact patch can transmit before the tire begins to lose traction, and therefore slide or skid.|$|R
50|$|Kenchanagudda {{is located}} 5 km west of Siruguppa. There are two routes to kenchanagudda. When coming from Ballari along NH-150A, take a left besides a petrol bunk, just before {{entering}} Siruguppa. The road, headed towards Kampli reaches the kenchanagudda village after 4 km. From the village, a small <b>road</b> <b>tangential</b> off {{the right of}} the main road leads to the vrindavana. To reach kenchanagudda from inside the Siruguppa town, follow the road leading to CNN school.|$|R
25|$|As {{the angle}} of bank θ {{approaches}} 90°, the tangent function approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/r. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for θ), and for sharper turns (smaller r) the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle θ does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force <b>tangential</b> to the <b>road</b> surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the coefficient of friction is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.|$|R
