5|$|Louise {{spent much}} of her time at Kent House, and she {{frequently}} visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral home, because the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and <b>two</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing <b>two</b> <b>dogs.</b> Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! <b>Two</b> <b>dogs,</b> an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E

5|$|Later on 2 May, {{the remains}} of Hitler, Braun, and <b>two</b> <b>dogs</b> (thought to be Blondi and her offspring, Wulf) were {{discovered}} in a shell crater by {{a unit of the}} Red Army intelligence agency SMERSH tasked with finding Hitler's body. Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead, and restricted the release of information to the public. The remains of Hitler and Braun were repeatedly buried and exhumed by SMERSH during the unit's relocation from Berlin to a new facility in Magdeburg. The bodies, along with the charred remains of propaganda minister Goebbels, his wife Magda, and their six children, were buried in an unmarked grave beneath a paved section of the front courtyard. The location was kept secret.|$|E
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His <b>two</b> <b>dogs,</b> Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E

5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's <b>two</b> <b>dogs</b> with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of hare {{coursing}} simply involved <b>two</b> <b>dogs</b> chasing a hare, the winner being the dog {{that caught the}} hare; this could be for sport, food or pest control. In order to indulge in the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E
5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare {{coursing}} {{was taking place}} in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially prohibited the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, {{hare coursing}} is still practised and popular. Hare coursing in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare coursing in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with <b>two</b> <b>dogs</b> and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the hare coursing is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E

5|$|In early 1938, both Jefferey and Cooper {{were sent}} back to Britain {{as part of the}} crew rotation. While docked in Hankou, Judy took a liking to another Pointer on board a French gunboat Francis Garnier. The two ship's {{companies}} held an impromptu wedding ceremony for the <b>two</b> <b>dogs.</b> The French Pointer, Paul, remained on the Gnat for three days before returning to his ship. Judy fell pregnant, and gave birth to thirteen puppies. Ten of them survived and were eventually given away to a variety of sources including the Francis Garnier and the American gunboat USS Guam. Judy was involved in an incident in October that year that resulted in the ending of her trips ashore in Hankou. Whilst being walked by two sailors from the Gnat, they were confronted by Japanese soldiers who pointed a loaded rifle at Judy. One of the soldiers was thrown into the Yangtze River by Leading Seaman Jack Law in response. During the following days, several Japanese officers came on board the Gnat and it was decided {{that it would be better}} for Judy to stay on the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania {{were called in}} to assist in {{restoring}} electricity. Damage across the island reached $8million, of which $3million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their <b>two</b> <b>dogs</b> in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August14.|$|E

In other art, as in the Laconian cup, Cerberus is usually three-headed. Occasionally, in Roman art, Cerberus is shown with a large central lion head, and <b>two</b> smaller <b>dog</b> heads on either side.|$|R
