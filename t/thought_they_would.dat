5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled {{to the point where}} the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary, and <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be departing if they were leaving town.|$|E

5|$|When {{the ride}} opened in 2000, Cedar Point chose High End Systems, {{headquartered}} in Austin, Texas, {{to light the}} ride. Rob Decker, Cedar Point’s Corporate Director of Planning & Design, said that they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have to mount multiple floodlights on the tower. However, {{they were able to}} install thirty EC-1 floodlights {{at the base of the}} lift hill structure which provided lighting throughout the ride's structure. Of the six main support towers, three had six EC-1s, and three towers had four EC-1s. The three tallest towers had another unit in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E

25|$|When Madison {{left office}} in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier, his tobacco {{plantation}} in Orange County, Virginia, {{not far from}} Jefferson's Monticello. Dolley, who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> finally {{have a chance to}} travel to Paris, was 49. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when elected. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to the continued price declines in tobacco and also due to his stepson's mismanagement.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 2000, Lu {{was elected}} vice president. She {{was awarded the}} World Peace Corps Mission's World Peace Prize in 2001.

25|$|On 22February1963, James {{suggested}} to Epstein that forming {{a company with}} Lennon, McCartney and Epstein would earn {{more money in the}} long run. Lennon and McCartney <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> own the whole company, but were given a 20 percent share each, Epstein 10 percent, and James and his partner, Charles Silver, 50 percent. Another company, Maclen Music—which published Lennon and McCartney's music in the US—was also controlled by Northern Songs. Both Northern Songs and Maclen Music were administered by Dick James Music. Northern Songs also published Harrison's early compositions, as well as Starr's.|$|E

25|$|If {{there were}} interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so {{the numbers of}} overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as {{described}} above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings {{was going to be}} shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 does have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.|$|E
25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high unsprung weight of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} used as it was <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be noisy {{in the confines of}} a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Holt Government {{amended the}} {{constitution}} to alter section 51 (xxvi) and remove section 127. This gave the federal government the power to legislate specifically for Indigenous Australians, and also allowed indigenous people to be enumerated in the census. The constitutional amendments required a referendum before they could be enacted, which passed with over 90% of the vote; it remains the largest referendum majority in Australian history. Holt personally considered the amendments unnecessary and mostly symbolic, but <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be well received {{by the international community}} (particularly Asia). According to Barrie Dexter, he was privately shocked by the referendum result, having been uncertain whether it would even pass.|$|E

25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 to tie. It is fair that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|E
