5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked <b>to</b> <b>sex</b> hormones.|$|E
5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related <b>to</b> <b>sex,</b> age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{variables}} that influence young women's ability <b>to</b> refuse <b>sex</b> {{with a man who}} has paid her school fees and a man who has power over her such as a teacher or employer. I use the 2002 Cameroon Adolescent Reproductive Health Survey, which contains information on a randomly selected sample of youth, aged 15 to 24 who reside in Yaoundé and Douala, Cameroon. Ability <b>to</b> refuse <b>sex</b> with one who paid school fees is positively associated with education, student status, and age, yet negatively associated with sexual experience, reporting most of friends have boyfriends, and tricked or unwanted first <b>sex.</b> Perceived ability <b>to</b> refuse <b>sex</b> with a teacher/employer is greater for Muslims and those reporting no religion, but less for those pressured by friends <b>to</b> have <b>sex.</b> Findings suggest that ability <b>to</b> refuse <b>sex</b> in general and ability <b>to</b> refuse <b>sex</b> under specific circumstances are distinct capabilities...|$|R

5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent <b>to</b> <b>sex</b> under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation <b>to</b> <b>Sex,</b> {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Paula Kamen, {{author of}} Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution, placed the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} Magic Wand as an influential factor in the sexual revolution which took place {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide <b>to</b> <b>Sex,</b> recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related <b>to</b> <b>sex.</b> In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, S.e.asiatica, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult <b>to</b> <b>sex</b> in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. Individuals can be reliably sexed as female from about 12days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier hue of their underparts.|$|E
50|$|Age {{of consent}} {{is also a}} key issue in sexual ethics. It is a {{controversial}} {{question of whether or}} not minors should be allowed <b>to</b> have <b>sex</b> for recreation or engage in sexual activities such as sexting. The debate includes whether or not minors can meaningfully consent <b>to</b> have <b>sex</b> with each other, and whether they can meaningfully consent <b>to</b> have <b>sex</b> with adults. In many places in the world, people are not legally allowed <b>to</b> have <b>sex</b> until they reach a set age. The age of consent averages around the age of 16. It is often debated whether or not people under the age of consent are capable of having consensual sexual relationships.|$|R

5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at Lilongwe's Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating <b>to</b> <b>sex,</b> including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>sex,</b> with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading <b>to</b> <b>sex</b> hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E

5|$|Within the Heathen {{community}} of the United States, gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward hypermasculinized behaviour, while a gendered division of labor—in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children—is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes <b>to</b> <b>sex</b> and gender—values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations—it {{has been argued that}} American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according <b>to</b> <b>sex,</b> but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E

5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} <b>to</b> <b>sex.</b> He {{received}} mixed messages {{on the subject}} from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and <b>to</b> <b>sex</b> markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation <b>to</b> <b>Sex,</b> followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|E
