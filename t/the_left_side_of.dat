5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body, and visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the visual field.|$|E
5|$|A {{hexagonal}} mortuary {{is located}} on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the façade. It was built by Father Bon between 1867 and 1868. Inside is a baroque retablo, similar to the altars inside the church. It is now used as an adoration chapel.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way.

5|$|Holmes was a {{hard working}} midfielder who possessed skill and could make neat passes, {{although}} he had been criticised for lacking in physical strength and tackling. He preferred to play as a central midfielder, although was able to play on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> midfield and was equally comfortable playing with either foot.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E

5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E

5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception {{in the initial stages}} until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. <b>The</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the wheel is normally reserved for options {{that will continue}} the conversation in depth, while options {{on the right side}} tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
