Sixty-eight people, veterinary surgeons or their unqualified assistants, with serological evidence of brucella antibodies measured by the anti-human globulin (Coombs) test and the complement-fixation test, some of whom had symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of brucellosis, were treated in two random groups. One group was given ampicillin, 1 g. four times a day for 28 days; the other took a placebo in identical capsules for the same period.

Plasma androstenedione concentrations showed a close correlation with plasma concentrations of 170 H-progesterone and testosterone. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the salivary androstenedione profiles and plasma testosterone concentrations in pubertal girls.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to summarize randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of acupuncture as published in Korean literature. Systematic searches were conducted on eight Korean medical databases. Manual searches were also conducted through eight major Korean medical journals. The methodological quality was assessed using a Jadad score. Studies evaluating needle acupuncture or auricular acupuncture (AA) with or without electrical stimulation were considered if they were sham or placebo-controlled or controlled against a comparative intervention. We also excluded acupuncture as an adjuvant to other treatments {{and other forms of}} acupuncture were excluded. Seven hundred and nine possibly relevant studies were identified and 10 RCTs were included. The methodological quality of the trials was generally poor. Manual acupuncture was compared to placebo acupuncture in four studies of patients with chronic low back pain, shoulder pain, premenstrual syndrome and allergic rhinitis. Three studies tested AA (two trials) and electroacupuncture (one trial) against no treatment, while three trials compared acupuncture with other active <b>therapeutic</b> <b>controls.</b> The methodological limitations of the included trials make their contribution to the current clinical evidence of acupuncture somewhat limited. The trial for premenstrual syndrome, shoulder pain and chronic low back pain added a limited contribution among those included RCTs.
