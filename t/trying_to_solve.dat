5|$|In a dark match {{before the}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, {{and that the}} belts would {{not be on the}} line at SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the mystery of the two Undertakers.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> {{the problem}} of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and {{the barrel of the}} M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake {{in order to reduce the}} recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|The story follows Rachel Beck, a {{young woman}} who wakes up in a shallow grave after being strangled. She does not {{remember}} the circumstances of the attack, but begins <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> her attempted murder {{with the help of her}} Aunt Johnny and close friend Jet. Their investigation soon gets put on hold when they learn of a plot to destroy their town through witchcraft and demonic spirits. The women ally with Zoe, a young girl who was possessed by a demon for nearly fifty years. Together, the women save the town and Rachel finds her killer.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing a}} Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{did not appear}} in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who {{introduced}} The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase’s Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting The Undertaker against The Undertaker. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen perform short segments <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad! and The Naked Gun films.|$|E
5|$|While Richard {{was still}} in Sicily, word reached {{the king of the}} {{disputes}} between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome. Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been. Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of one new good to a single-good market allows for opportunity costs {{to be determined}} only in relation to that other good. However, its weakness is that it ignores all other possible choices. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> this problem by adding even more goods to the market makes analysis unwieldy.

This first-order differential equation has a deceptively simple appearance, since ƒ can represent an arbitrary single-particle distribution function.

Another essential problem for SKM management are people defacing Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs) with graffiti.

25|$|Shortwave signals {{presented}} {{a problem for}} RDF because the skywave signal can be simultaneously received from several hops, making it appear as if the transmitter is at several different bearings. The solution had already been studied, although not in order to solve this specific problem. In 1917 Frank Adcock was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the problem of making large antennae suitable for use with the radiogoniometer at even the longest wavelengths. He developed a system using four very tall masts, connected together electrically to form two virtual loops. This eliminated the need to connect {{the tops of the}} antennae, which were otherwise difficult to connect together for very large antennae. However, it was later found that the underground connections between the antennae shielded them from skywaves, allowing only the direct-line groundwave to reach the goniometer.|$|E

25|$|Japp is a Scotland Yard Inspector {{and appears}} {{in many of}} the stories <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> cases that Poirot is working on. Japp is outgoing, loud and {{sometimes}} inconsiderate by nature and his relationship with the refined Belgian is one of the stranger aspects of Poirot’s world. He first met Poirot in Belgium in 1904, during the Abercrombie Forgery. Later that year they joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as Baron Altara. They also meet in England where Poirot often helps Japp and lets him take credit in return for special favours. These favours usually entail Poirot being supplied with other interesting cases. In Agatha Christie's Poirot, Japp was portrayed by Philip Jackson. In the film, Thirteen at Dinner (1985), adapted from Lord Edgware Dies, the role of Japp was taken by the actor David Suchet, who would later star as Poirot in the ITV adaptations.|$|E

Viswanath scored a hundred in 200 minutes with 15 fours. Robins' XI declared just before tea setting India 182 in around two hours.
