5|$|In April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the SWT units would be fitted with new traction equipment provided by Vossloh Kiepe. As part of the re-powering of the fleet, the air operated camshaft and electrical resistance grids will be removed, as well as the EE507 <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The new equipment consists of DC to AC inverters of the IGBT type. This is needed as the replacement <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> are AC rather than DC.|$|E
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was {{completed}} by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the diesel-electric locomotives that soon displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> connected to the axles in the train's front truck.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the <b>traction</b> <b>motors,</b> while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} improve the ventilation performance of permanent magnet synchronous <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> {{used in the}} rail transit，this paper，taking a 600 kW permanent magnet synchronous <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> as an example，and based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the basic theory of heat transfer，establishes the three dimensional physical model under its ventilation scheme {{for the analysis of}} temperature field. Applying the finite volume element method，each part of the permanent magnet synchronous <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> was numerical analyzed.

5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the {{generated}} electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and <b>traction</b> <b>motors,</b> fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{modeling}} method is presented for networked traction control systems by introducing Networked Control Systems (NCSs) into the asynchronous <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> driving system.

25|$|In older locomotives, it was {{necessary}} for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the load meter (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the <b>traction</b> <b>motors)</b> was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> from overloading from improper transition.|$|E
