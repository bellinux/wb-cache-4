Judah came out {{strongly}} in the first round, landing numerous shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor {{to take a look at}} <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> Due to the severity of <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> the fight was waved off. <b>The</b> <b>cut</b> was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E

5|$|Amid notable controversy, Sörenstam {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} PGA Tour's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who {{qualified}} for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, was particularly critical of her presence; he was quoted saying she had no business playing and he hoped she missed <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds, missing <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance.|$|E

5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{has been}} widely grown in Australian gardens {{on the east coast}} for many years, and is used to a limited extent in <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> flower industry. Compact dwarf cultivars such as Banksia 'Little Eric' have become more popular in recent years with the trend toward smaller gardens.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts {{there is a tendency}} for the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique will be ready for commercial use.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

In a friendly match against Tom Vardon at Sandwich on 27 May 1903, Strong made a hole-in-one (likely wind assisted) on a par 4 hole. He entered the 1903 Open Championship held at Prestwick Golf Club, South Ayrshire, Scotland, but failed to advance past the half-way cut. In the 1904 Open Championship, again held on his home course at Sandwich, Strong opened with a first round 93—in windy and cold conditions—but could only improve to 88 in round two when the weather improved. He ended up missing <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> by 13 strokes, which came at 168.|$|E

5|$|The Limehouse Cut {{would give}} {{direct access to}} the River Thames, {{avoiding}} the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, but some of the brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed into it, and it was soon decided that it was too narrow, and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates).

40|$|An {{expansion}} joint {{that allows a}} guideway of a magnetic levitation transportation system to expand and contract while minimizing transients occurring in the magnetic lift and drag forces acting on a magnetic levitation vehicle traveling over the joint includes an upper cut or recess extending downwardly from the upper surface of the guideway and a non-intersecting lower cut or recess that extends upwardly from the lower surface of the guideway. The sidewalls of <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> can be {{parallel to each other}} and the vertical axis of the guideway; the depth of <b>the</b> lower <b>cut</b> can be greater than the depth of the upper cut; and the overall combined lengths of <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> can be greater than the thickness of the guideway from the upper to lower surface so that <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> will overlap, but be spaced apart from each other. The distance between <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> can be determined {{on the basis of the}} force transients and the mechanical behavior of the guideway.

40|$|Abstract. We assume some {{standard}} {{choices for}} <b>the</b> branch <b>cuts</b> {{of a group}} of functions and consider the problem of then calculating <b>the</b> branch <b>cuts</b> of expressions involving those functions. Typical examples include the addition formulae for inverse trigonometric functions. Un-derstanding these cuts is essential for working with the single-valued counterparts, the common approach to encoding multi-valued functions in computer algebra systems. While the defining choices are usually sim-ple (typically portions of either the real or imaginary axes) <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> induced by <b>the</b> expression may be surprisingly complicated. We have made explicit and implemented techniques for calculating <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> in <b>the</b> computer algebra programme Maple. We discuss the issues raised, clas-sifying <b>the</b> different <b>cuts</b> produced. <b>The</b> techniques have been gathered in the BranchCuts package, along with tools for visualising <b>the</b> <b>cuts.</b> <b>The</b> package is included in Maple 17 as part of the FunctionAdvisor tool. ...|$|R
