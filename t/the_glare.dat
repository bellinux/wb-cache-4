5|$|Since Voyager 2s fly-by, the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths in which <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still {{far below the}} visibility threshold.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} crew {{took control}} of the site by erecting scaffolding on 6 December 2006, and demolition commenced on 12 December. Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face, leaving a gaping hole, and then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece. After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled, away from <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of publicity.|$|E
5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment's {{experiences}} with the aircraft revealed other problems. Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed his night vision and <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot. Crews complained bitterly {{that the lack of}} frontal armor made them vulnerable to defensive fire from German bombers. Flash hiders installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems, but the lack of armor could not be rectified immediately. Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS-82 and RS-132 rockets for ground-attack missions. Another common addition was a launcher for DAG-10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E

25|$|High beam (main beam, driving beam, full beam) {{headlamps}} {{provide a}} bright, center-weighted distribution of light with no particular control of light directed towards other road users' eyes.

25|$|Each {{cone cell}} of a bird’s retina {{contains}} an oil droplet which may contain carotenoid pigments. These droplets enhance colour vision and reduce glare. Aquatic kingfishers have {{high numbers of}} red pigments in their oil droplets; the reason red droplets predominate is not understood, but the droplets may help with <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> or the dispersion of light from particulate matter in the water.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{located between}} and {{parallel}} to Queen Street and Victoria Street, and bisected by Ophir Road, Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, Bugis Street, just a stone's throw away. It was the seedy haunt of transgender prostitutes who solicited sex from locals, away from <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of Western tourists. No photographs or media attention {{were focused on}} this street of ill-repute; only a no-frills approach to an economic exchange.|$|E

25|$|The only {{complaint}} {{from the}} Australian side about the umpiring was that Ray Lindwall thought Denis Compton {{should have been}} stumped in both innings of the Fourth Test before he reached either of his centuries. In the first innings <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> from the sun (it was 105°F/40°C) was so bright that the white paint of the crease could not be seen clearly, and the same may have applied in the second innings, but little fuss was made of this.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Italian {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat {{more than a}} month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time {{were not able to}} extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} some stars that seemingly orbit around an empty space. Astrometric binaries are relatively nearby stars {{which can be}} seen to wobble around a point in space, with no visible companion. The same mathematics used for ordinary binaries can be applied to infer the mass of the missing companion. The companion could be very dim, so that it is currently undetectable or masked by <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of its primary, or it could be an object that emits little or no electromagnetic radiation, for example a neutron star.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, south facing {{solar panels}} were {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the parking garage, but they caused so much glare for the nearby control tower for 45 minutes each morning that they were removed, and later replaced with 2,210 panels (460kW AC) that were reoriented to the east to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>glare.</b> The airport expects to save $100,000 each year on electricity by having the solar panels. The efficiency of east or west facing panels is reduced by about 10% so more panels were added so the total generation would be about the same, and the array is expected to generate about 585,000 kWh each year.|$|E
25|$|NSG commandos {{based in}} Mehram Nagar, Palam Airport, Delhi took 10 hours {{to reach the}} sites. They were ready at 01:00, but had to wait three hours (until 03:15) for an {{aircraft}} to arrive from Chandigarh when the policy was that a plane be at Palam permanently. The NSG commandos landed at Mumbai Airport at 05:15, but had to wait an hour for the Bombay police to arrange BEST buses for them. They reached the Taj Mahal Hotel and the Oberoi Trident Hotel at 07:00, but initially were not given detailed maps of the buildings. The operations in the Taj Mahal hotel and Nariman House were conducted under <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of the media, which may have assisted the terrorists by removing the element of surprise.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{served in}} the Second World War, {{initially}} on the air staff within the Directorate of Organisation at the Air Ministry, and was promoted to the temporary rank of wing commander on 1 March 1940 (made permanent in April 1942). He was appointed Officer Commanding No. 219 Squadron flying Bristol Beaufighters from RAF Tangmere in February 1941 and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 13 May 1941 for showing great skill in intercepting enemy aircraft at night, destroying a raiding aircraft on his first night patrol. He was awarded a bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross on 30 May 1941 for engaging attackers at night when the aerodrome was illuminated by <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> from {{a large number of}} incendiary bombs.|$|E

25|$|Glare-free {{high beam}} is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} high beam pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> that would result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E
25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes {{because it is so}} close to Neptune that it is lost in <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
