Text external features are also investigated. The Gattung can be indentified as an announcement of judgment presented as a warning.

40|$|In the {{development}} of ekphonetic notation, three phases are recognized: the pre-classical (9 th- 10 th c.), the classical (11 th- 12 th c.) and the degenerate system. By {{the end of the}} 12 th century, in some manuscripts the rules of application of the neume pairs had already changed, so that the system during the 13 th and the 14 th centuries is misinterpreted and after the 15 th century is completely forgotten. Within this framework, some Gospel lectionaries of the 11 th- 12 th centuries show a particular use of the neume synemba. In this study, different combinations with the neume synemba are analysed in connection with both the grammatical structure of the text and its meaning, and with the liturgical time in which <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> <b>were</b> read...|$|R

The second and third pericopes have also halakic exordiums closing with the words, מנין ממה שקרינו בענין..., in which, however, the question is put without any formula.

40|$|Mal 3 : 22 24 is one {{of those}} <b>pericopes</b> in which <b>the</b> Masoretic Text (MT) clearly diverges from the LXX.

40|$|The {{story of}} Blind Bartimaeus (Mk 10 : 46 - 52) {{displays}} some traits that are unusual in a synoptic healing miracle and it displays {{most of the}} features of a call story. The genesis of the narration may account for the combination of these two genres: the story about the calling of the blind beggar Bartimaeus has been expanded by that of the healing of the blind man, where Jesus focuses attention on his faith. Next, the crowd was introduced to highlight Bartimaeus’ faith. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>pericope</b> <b>was</b> adapted to fit into Mark’s Gospel. The main editorial contribution of the evangelist is his contextualizing of the scene {{at the end of the}} section 8 : 27 - 10 : 52, which deals with Jesus’ journey to Jerusalem, to suffering and death. In this episode Jesus calls Bartimaeus to follow him on his way. Mark added significance to the story by contrasting Bartimaeus with other characters, especially Peter, James and John, the foremost three disciples. This contrast may imply some criticism of leadership in the Markan community...|$|R
50|$|It is {{especially}} from a liturgical {{point of view}} that the study of Evangeliaria is interesting. The general method of Greek Evangeliaria is uniform: the first part contains the Gospels of the Sundays beginning with Easter; the second part gives the Gospels for the festivals of the saints beginning with 1 September. In the Churches of the West the distribution of <b>the</b> Gospel <b>pericopes</b> <b>was</b> more divergent because of the various rites.

2500|$|One {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> <b>pericope</b> (passage) <b>is</b> how it {{highlights}} {{the relationship between}} Jesus and his apostles. Merrill Tenney states that the incident is in essence centered on that aspect, rather than their peril or the miracle itself. Dwight Pentecost and John Danilson state that this miracle was deliberately designed by Jesus to instruct his apostles and increase their faith. David Cook and Craig Evans note that [...] "of little faith" [...] is a somewhat common expression in Matthew (e.g. [...] when calming the storm or [...] regarding bread and the Pharisees just before the Confession of Peter) and may mean [...] "of no faith".|$|R
