5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} {{combined}} remnants of Marco and Klaus extended into the Ohio Valley, with 3.67 inches (93 mm) recorded near Mountain City, Tennessee. Totals of 2–5 inches (50–125 mm) spread across northwest Virginia, western Maryland, eastern West Virginia, and the Susquehanna Valley of Pennsylvania. In New York, the rainfall combined with moisture from Hurricane Lili, which triggered flooding <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> {{a portion of}} a railway line and a highway.|$|E
5|$|The Playhouse theatre on Westgate was {{constructed}} in 1825, and sold in 1856 to be converted into an infants school and later a library and offices. In 1994, Sleaford Little Theatre bought and restored it and in 2000 it opened to the public. The Sleaford Picturedrome opened in 1920; the cinema closed in 2000 and the building became a snooker hall and then a nightclub <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> in 2008.|$|E

For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during the afternoon and pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal. The Israeli attack had been thoroughly routed.|$|E
5|$|Breyer {{served as}} a law clerk to Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg during the 1964 term (list), and served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission. He was a special {{assistant}} to the United States Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust from 1965 to 1967 and an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 1974 to 1975 and served as chief counsel of the committee from 1979 to 1980. He worked closely with the chairman of the committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to pass the Airline Deregulation Act <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> the Civil Aeronautics Board.|$|E
5|$|Davide Cassani won {{the fifteenth}} stage that {{featured}} a summit finish to Lumezzane, while the general classification remained largely unaltered.

The stage ultimately finished with a bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. The Giro's seventeenth stage concluded with a summit finish to Chianale. Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> with a field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears {{that they will}} not be paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult. Mills was close to a deal with German investment firm, Deutsche Immobilien Fonds A.G. prior to the difficulties. DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed on the office space portion of the project. Mills eventually sold the retail space rights to Chicago developer Joseph Freed & Associates, who had previously purchased the nearby Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building (located at 1 South State Street) <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> in early 2007.|$|E
5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> the episode.|$|E
5|$|Other attractions <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> {{at about}} the same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and the miniature railway. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E

5|$|Saidor {{was soon}} in {{use by the}} Fifth Air Force. Its base at Nadzab was {{surrounded}} by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, {{but there was no}} such problem at Saidor. During March, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia. A raid on Hollandia on 16 April 1944 encountered a weather front <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> Nadzab and the other fields in the Markham Valley. More than 30 aircraft made their way to Saidor. An F-5 Lightning and a B-25 Mitchell collided on the runway, and two aircraft cracked up on landing, but the other aircraft that made it to Saidor eventually returned to their bases.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking power, Lenin's regime {{issued a}} series of decrees. The first was a Decree on Land, which {{declared}} that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for agricultural collectivisation but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued the Decree on the Press <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed the measure would be temporary; the decree was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.|$|E
5|$|From September 2 to September 3, large waves, some {{as high as}} , {{impacted}} beaches throughout southern California, with Los Angeles and Orange Counties experiencing growing breakers, and Cabrillo Beach experiencing riptides for {{two days}} straight. Due to the Labor Day beach turnout, many reports of rescuing swimmers who were swept up by waves caused by the hurricane were received. On September 2, forty-seven swimmers in Zuma Beach had to be rescued despite warnings {{to stay out of}} deep water, and an additional 261 rescues were reported in Newport. More rescues were reported the next day, although no exact total from the second day is known. At the El Morro Beach Trailer Park near Laguna Beach, a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) were ripped from their supports by rough seas. Long Beach, in terms of damage, was particularly hit hard by Liza, with debris and sea foam from the heavy surf clogging storm drains. A group of tidal pools formed along an area of the beach, draining out from a parking lot on 72nd Street onto Ocean Boulevard, resulting in flooding <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> a section of the boulevard between 68th Place and 72nd Place to traffic. Various flower gardens were also reported to have been swamped by the flooding, but no damage to housing was reported. The weakened properties in West Newport Beach also sustained no additional damage.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie {{about the concept}} of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and in one of its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E
5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low {{in side view}} and triangular in top view, longer than it was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E
5|$|US30 heads {{southeast}} into Hammonton, Atlantic County, {{continuing through}} rural areas with increasing development. The road comes to its intersection with the southern terminus US206 {{and the northern}} terminus of Route54. A short distance later, the route has a concurrency with CR542 that begins adjacent to the former Atlanticare - Kessler Memorial Hospital <b>that</b> <b>closed</b> in 2009 and passes by Hammonton Lake. US30 turns south-southwest past the CR542 concurrency before heading south. The route crosses CR561 and turns southeast again, entering Mullica Township. Here, the White Horse Pike enters more forested areas with a few buildings, running a short distance to the northeast of the Atlantic City Line. Past the intersection with CR623 in the developed community of Elwood, US30 becomes a divided highway with grass median and jughandles. This configuration continues until Egg Harbor City, when the median ends. In Egg Harbor City, US30 passes a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting Route50 and CR563 {{in the center of}} town. At this point, CR563 forms a concurrency with US30 and the two routes continue through more of the town before crossing into Galloway Township at the intersection with CR674. The road passes through rural areas with some development, reaching the community of Cologne. In this area, there is a crossroads with CR614 before CR563 splits from US30 by turning south onto Tilton Road. Past Cologne, the road reaches a junction with CR575 in the developed community of Pomona.|$|E
