50|$|The <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> (Discoglossus sardus) is {{a species}} of frog in the Alytidae family (formerly Discoglossidae). It is found in Sardinia, Corsica and the Tuscan Archipelago.|$|E
50|$|The Corsican {{painted frog}} is found {{only on the}} island of Corsica. It mainly occurs in the central region at altitudes of 300 to 1900 m, {{especially}} in mountain torrents and both still and flowing water in woods and forests. It shares its range with the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> ((Discoglossus sardus)) but is a more montane species, adept at leaping from rock to rock.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> {{is found}} {{in most parts of}} the islands of Corsica and Sardinia but it is not present in the central highlands. It is also present on several small islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea such as Iles d'Hyères, Giglio, Montecristo, and the Monte Argentario {{peninsula}} in Tuscany. Its habitats include coastal plains, forest streams, maquis shrubland and upland coniferous forests. Slow streams and pools are used for breeding and this frog can tolerate brackish water.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrographic network}} {{includes}} numerous streams and springs. The river Golo rises from 1991 metres in the commune {{south of the}} Paglia Orba (2525 m) and 200 m {{to the south of}} the Capu Tafunatu (2335 m). Its course is interrupted by the Calacuccia Dam. It leaves the commune 200 metres upstream of the Mazzola bridge on the D218 road. The Viru, the main tributary of the commune, is fed by several streams such as that of Paglia Orba and Foggiale bordered in part by the GR 20. At the bottom of the creek beds, there are native species: the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frogs</b> (a bariulata) - toads living up to 1900 m and Corsican brook salamanders (a Tarantella). The Corsican brook salamander has no lungs. It breathes through the skin and mouth.|$|R

50|$|There are six {{species in}} this genus. The Hula <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> (Latonia nigriventer) was {{included}} in this genus until further genetic analysis placed the hula <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> in the genus Latonia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the Corsican painted frog (Discoglossus montalentii) but has a noticeably less rounded snout and a more rounded back. The fourth finger of its front foot is spatulate rather than tapering and its hind legs are shorter. It grows to about 6.5 cm long. The colour varies and is either plain brown, grey or reddish brown, or one of these colours with dark brown spots {{that do not have}} pale edges. The underside is pale.|$|E

The call is more musical than other painted frogs and consists of a repeated [...] "poop - poop - poop".|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the causative {{agent of}} the {{amphibian}} disease chytridiomycosis, {{is an important factor}} in the global decline of amphibians. Within Europe, animals that exhibit clinical signs of the disease have only been reported in Spain despite the pathogen’s wide, but patchy, distribution on the continent. Recently, another occurrence of chytridiomycosis was reported in Euproctus platycephalus, the Sardinian brook newt, on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, but without any evidence of fatal disease. We report further evidence of the emergence of Bd on Sardinia and the first evidence of lethal chytridiomycosis outside of Spain. Unusual mortalities of the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> (Discoglossus sardus) were found at three sites in the Limbara mountains of northern Sardinia. Molecular and histological screens of corpses, frogs, and tadpoles from these sites revealed infection with Bd. Infection and mortality occurred at locations that are unusual in terms of the published habitat requirements of the pathogen. Given the endemicity, the IUCN Red List status of the amphibian species on Sardinia, and the occurrence of infection and mortality caused by chytridiomycosis, there is serious reason for concern for the impact that disease emergence may have on the conservation of the amphibians of the island...|$|E
50|$|This frog is {{very closely}} related to the Iberian <b>painted</b> <b>frog,</b> but they differ in a couple of {{significant}} ways. The Spanish <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> will have shorter snouts and smaller forefeet than their Iberian counterparts.|$|R
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about the biology of the Spanish <b>painted</b> <b>frog,</b> but it is {{believed}} to be very {{similar to that of the}} Iberian <b>painted</b> <b>frog.</b> It is believed to be active year round. Eggs are usually laid in small, shallow bodies of water.|$|R

40|$|Norepinephrine-stimulated skin {{secretions}} of the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> Discoglossus sardus Tschudi, 1837 (Alytidae) did {{not contain}} any peptide with antimicrobial or hemolytic activity. However, peptidomic analysis of the secretions revealed {{the presence of an}} abundant peptide with structural similarity to frenatin 2, previously isolated from the Australian frog Litoria infrafrenata (Hylidae). The primary structure of the peptide, termed frenatin 2 D, was established as DLLGTLGNLPLPFI. NH 2 by automated Edman degradation and mass spectrometry with electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) -based fragmentation and confirmed by chemical synthesis. The structure of a second frenatin 2 -related peptide, termed frenatin 2. 1 D, that was present in much lower abundance was established as GTLGNLPAPFPG. Frenatin 2 D (20 μg/ml) significantly stimulated production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α (P< 0. 05) and IL- 1 β (P< 0. 01) by mouse peritoneal macrophages but the peptide did not potentiate the stimulation produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The peptide increased IL- 12 production in both unstimulated (P< 0. 01) and LPS-stimulated (P< 0. 05) cells but stimulatory effects on IL- 6 production were not significant. The biological role of frenatin 2 D is unknown but it is speculated that the peptide acts on skin macrophages to produce a cytokine-mediated stimulation of the adaptive immune system in response to invasion by microorganisms...|$|E

25|$|The {{critically}} endangered Hula <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> (Latonia nigriventer) {{is found}} in the Hula Valley and was endemic to the lake that used to fill the valley. The lake was drained in the 1950s to combat malaria and create more farmland, but the draining of the lake led to the destruction of its unique ecosystem.

40|$|There {{are only}} two species that are {{presently}} found living in the wild in the Maltese Islands: the <b>Painted</b> <b>Frog</b> (scientifically Discoglossus pictus) and Bedriaga’s Frog (scientifically Rana bedriagae also known as Pelophylax bedriagae). The <b>Painted</b> <b>Frog</b> is a true native and semi-fossilized bones of this species {{have been found in}} the superficial deposits at Ghar Dalam. However, Bedriaga’s Frog is a recent arrival that seems to have only managed to establish a breeding population in Gozo, sometime in the late 1990 s. The <b>Painted</b> <b>Frog</b> is the only native living amphibian in the Maltese Islands; however, a few years ago, amateur herpetologist Arnold Sciberras, discovered a thriving population of a different species of frogs in the freshwater pool at Ta’ Sarraflu in Gozo; the Bedriaga’s Frog. The presence of Bedriaga’s Frog at Ta’ Sarraflu is worrying as it has a negative impact on the ecology and biota of the surrounding area. N/...|$|R
