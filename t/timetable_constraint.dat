40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a complete and}} efficient solution to the stochastic allocation and scheduling for Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC). Given a conditional task graph characterizing a target application and a target architecture with alternative memory and computation resources, we compute an allocation and schedule minimizing the expected value of communication cost, being the communication resources {{one of the major}} bottlenecks in modern MPSoCs. Our approach is based on the Logic Based Benders decomposition where the stochastic allocation is solved through an Integer Programming solver, while the scheduling problem with conditional activities is faced with Constraint Programming. The two solvers interact through no-goods. The original contributions of the approach appear both in the allocation and in the scheduling part. For the first, we propose an exact analytic formulation of the stochastic objective function based on the task graph analysis, while for the scheduling part we extend the <b>timetable</b> <b>constraint</b> for conditional activities. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{levels of}} system integration in Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) emphasize {{the need for}} new design flows for efficient mapping of multi-task applications onto hardware platforms. Even though data-flow graphs are often used for pure data-streaming, many realistic applications can only be specified as conditional task graphs (CTG). The problem of allocating and scheduling conditional task graphs on processors in a distributed real-time system is NP-hard. The first contribution of this paper is a complete stochastic allocation and scheduling framework, where an MPSoC virtual platform is used to accurately derive input parameters, validate abstract models of system components and assess constraint satisfaction and objective function optimization. The optimizer implements an efficient and exact approach to allocation and scheduling based on problem decomposition. The original contributions of the approach appear both in the allocation and in the scheduling part of the optimizer. For the first, we propose an exact analytic formulation of the stochastic objective function based on the task graph analysis, while for the scheduling part we extend the <b>timetable</b> <b>constraint</b> for conditional activities. The second contribution of this paper is the introduction of a software library and API for the deployment of conditional task graph applications onto Multi-Processor System-on-Chips. With our library support, programmers can quickly develop multi-task applications which will run on a multi-core architecture and can easily apply the optimal solution found by our optimizer. The proposed programming support manages OS-level issues, such as task allocation and scheduling, as well as task-level issues, like inter-task communication and synchronization...|$|E

In addition to the hard constraints,there are often many soft constraints which are desirable to satisfy. In this study, the timetable scheduling for Faculty of Computer System & Software Engineering (FSKKP) of University College of Engineering & Technology Malaysia (KUKTEM) has been studied to develop new prototype software for generating timetable. Basically,FSKKP is still using human power in generating its timetable instead of using timetable scheduling software. Since the timetable is configured manually,it is time-consumed as well as it needs extra human resources to manage it. The university has its own system for generating timetable which involving all of the faculties, but it is still in maintenance for perfecting and enhancement since it still has weaknesses. In this project development,the prototype will be implemented with rule-based approach as the solution to overcome the <b>timetable</b> <b>constraints</b> and rules.

Industrial and governmental bodies have spoken repeatedly about the need for skill-building in the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, including Chemistry, that are seen as vital in underpinning the Knowledge Economy and aiding Ireland’s recovery from economic downturn. Uptake of Chemistry as a subject for the terminal examination at second level in Ireland, the Leaving Certificate, has seen a slight increase to over fourteen per cent. However, this turnaround could be difficult to maintain due to a number of factors, not least the fiscal situation and its effect on school budgets for more expensive practical subjects, as well as allocation of subjects to students within <b>timetabling</b> <b>constraints</b> and choice by students of the science and technology subjects. The latter is further influenced by attitudes to, experiences of and perceived usefulness of Chemistry, both by students and their guardians.

30|$|Research on the {{accident}} delay of the high-speed railway {{can be classified}} into two aspects: emergency rescheduling and delay propagation. Emergency rescheduling methods manage to minimize operation conflicts and train delay to optimize rescheduling strategies and predict influence according to accident characteristics. Meng and Zhou [13] developed an innovative integer programming model for train dispatching on an N-track network by means of simultaneously rerouting and rescheduling trains. Wang and Goverde [14] have determined a <b>timetable</b> <b>constraints</b> set with accessibility and non-conflict under delay accidents of single-track railway, upon which a train rescheduling model was established aiming to reduce global delay time and energy consumption. Carey and Kwieciński [15] conducted a stochastic simulation of trains on line section to establish an approximation model between scheduled headway and secondary delay for the coefficient modification and schedule optimization of current operation plan. Louwerse and Huisman [16] studied the rescheduling methods to seek a higher service level based on event-activity network using integer programming. Cadarso and Ángel [17] presented an approach to optimize timetable and rolling stock assignment with special consideration of passenger demand under large-scale disruptions in rapid transit network. Delay propagation models help to combine micro-propagation model with mathematical statistics to predict and estimate the service performance and transport efficiency, and max-plus algebra [18] and stochastic distribution [19] are often used {{in this kind of}} research. In the max-plus algebra, by viewing the operation plan under periodic timetable as a discrete event dynamic system, a recursion function considering buffer time and recovery time can be formulated to describe the train operating status and further reveal the time–space propagation mechanism. In the stochastic distribution model, activity graph theory is applied to describe primary delay and secondary delay and construct relevant cumulative distribution function by considering delay as a random variable.|$|R

Driving style can play a rewarding role for the energy saving in itself {{and it is an}} important reference for the evaluation of technologies and operational measures aiming at energy saving. Today energy meters on board the trains cover a lack of information about the real energy consumption of trains, therefore the authors are working on realistic and suitable methodological approaches for data handling towards clearly defined objectives. In fact such data seem difficult to be useful if not well managed. The research activity is aiming to provide with a simplified approach for energy consumption evaluation useful to determine the more suitable driving style to save energy and respect the timetable in a specific line with a specific train. The proposed methodology is based on a simplified set of data: characteristics of the line usually provided by the infrastructure manager to operators and from them to their drivers, as well as the rolling stock characteristics usually provided by the supplier as design documentation.

40|$|There is a {{perception}} that teaching space in universities is a rather scarce resource. However, some studies have revealed that in many institutions it is actually chronically under-used. Often, rooms are occupied only half the time, and even when in use they are often only half full. This is usually measured by the ‘utilization' which {{is defined as the}} percentage of available ‘seat-hours' that are employed. Within real institutions, studies have shown that this utilization can often take values as low as 20 - 40 %. One consequence of such a low level of utilization is that space managers are under pressure to make more efficient use of the available teaching space. However, better management is hampered because there {{does not appear to be}} a good understanding within space management (near-term planning) of why this happens. This is accompanied, within space planning (long-term planning) by a lack of expertise on how best to accommodate the expected low utilizations. This motivates our two main goals: (i) To understand the factors that drive down utilizations, (ii) To set up methods to provide better space planning. Here, we provide quantitative evidence that <b>constraints</b> arising from <b>timetabling</b> and location requirements easily have the potential to explain the low utilizations seen in reality. Furthermore, on considering the decision question ‘Can this given set of courses all be allocated in the available teaching space?' we find that the answer depends on the associated utilization in a way that exhibits threshold behaviour: There is a sharp division between regions in which the answer is ‘almost always yes' and those of ‘almost always no'. Through analysis and understanding of the space of potential solutions, our work suggests that better use of space within universities will come about through an understanding of the effects of <b>timetabling</b> <b>constraints</b> and when it is statistically likely that it will be possible for a set of courses to be allocated to a particular space. The results presented here provide a firm foundation for university managers to take decisions on how space should be managed and planned for more effectively.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of tools are {{available}} for generating timetable based on the constraints provided by user. The tools generally consider those constraints which are insensate and which are unavoidable. They emphasize mainly on the specifications of classrooms, teachers, subjects but {{are not able to}} fit in constraints related to the human factors like fondness, placate and weakness of the major target stake holders namely teachers and students. To make system which works like humans, it might be highly beneficial to frame rules stating the personal preferences of the main stakeholders and subsequently design the timetable incorporating these rules as well. This paper presents a survey done to find the preferences of teachers and later concludes with the rules mined using classification method. Later these rules can be utilized intelligently for an insightful timetable generation.

40|$|Employee Timetabling Problems (ETP) are {{all around}} us. One {{possible}} approach for solving ETPs is to use constraint processing techniques. Another approach is to model human knowledge which is commonly used for solving such problems into knowledge-based systems for timetabling. It is difficult to represent the complex <b>constraints</b> of <b>timetabling</b> explicitly in <b>constraint</b> networks. On the other hand, knowledgebased representations of constraints are implicit and cannot support most of the heuristics of constraint based processing {{that have been developed}} over the last decade. The present paper presents an approach to representing and processing employee timetabling problems by a combination of explicit representations of some constraints in the network and rule-based processing in which heuristics for generic constraints of ETPs are embedded. This mixed-mode approach has been implemented {{in the form of a}} software package for defining and solving real world ETPs. A general descri [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|The International Baccalaureate {{took its}} first cohort of {{students}} in 2011. For the first 2-year course a variety of SL and HL subjects have been offered along with TOK (Theory of Knowledge). Subjects World Literature and Mathematics are compulsory but are at SL and HL. One subject from Biology, Chemistry or Physics must be chosen at SL or HL. One subject from History, Geography or Economics must be chosen at SL or HL. One subject from French, Spanish, German (and hopefully in the future Mandarin and Latin) at ab initio [...] level, SL or HL. One more option is fulfilled by a science, humanities or foreign language option or the choice of Visual Arts at SL or HL. [...] In March 2013 prospective students were informed that the International Baccalaureate {{will no longer be}} offered due to lack of interest and applications from internal Year 11 students who wished to stay on the next year, and <b>timetable</b> and staffing <b>constraints.</b>|$|R
40|$|Examination {{timetabling}} involves assigning the exams into timeslots and rooms, {{fitting the}} student numbers into suitable exam locations, and ensuring adequate rest gaps between exams for all students. In this study, the examination timetabling problem from Kolej Poly-Tech Mara (KPTM) Kuantan, is being investigated. The KPTM dataset is a capacitated problem with unique constraints {{when compared to}} the benchmark examination datasets from the literature. Currently, KPTM Kuantan uses proprietary software to generate the timetable. However, it requires manual process to determine whether the <b>timetable</b> satisfies the <b>constraints.</b> Furthermore, having no mathematical model makes it difficult to determine the timetable quality. The research aim is to develop a formal mathematical model and test the proposed model by producing an examination timetable. The generated timetable is compared with the KPTM Kuantan proprietary software examination timetable. The experiment shows that our result outperforms the timetable produced by KPTM while adhering to the hard constraints which the proprietary software fails to achieve...|$|R
