5|$|The FBI {{intends to}} plant a fake {{advertisement}} to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code <b>the</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>Fairy</b> will know it is fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of <b>the</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>Fairy</b> to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by <b>the</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>Fairy</b> (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{travels to}} the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is {{contacted}} by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize it is from <b>the</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>Fairy,</b> expressing admiration for Lecktor—and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It {{is found to be}} an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.|$|E
5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy.</b> Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E

When Peter is watching television, he is watching the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show. [...] When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused.

2500|$|As the Doctor accidentally did {{not return}} for her until twelve years later, Amy grew up a {{different}} person than she would have. She had become [...] "cynical" [...] and [...] "distrustful" [...] as the Doctor {{did not return}} as he had promised and {{she was forced to}} believe he was just an imaginary friend, and had resorted to being [...] "tough". Moffat theorised that Amy would have taken her anger out on Rory and would have been [...] "mean" [...] about things such as Santa Claus and <b>the</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>Fairy.</b> The second episode, [...] "The Beast Below", was to introduce Amy into the role of the Doctor's companion and how much he needed one. Though Amy soon tries to seduce the Doctor, Moffat believed that it was consistent with the cynical character he had built up. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment". In [...] "Amy's Choice", meant to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship, Rory dies in an alternate universe that was a result of psychic pollen that had entered the TARDIS. This is when Amy truly realises her feelings for Rory. As a primary part of the series' story arc, Rory officially dies and is erased from history and Amy's memory. Though Rory later returns, he is an Auton duplicate who kills her, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy. The end of [...] "The Big Bang", in which Amy stands up at her wedding and declares the Doctor is real, was the Doctor's success at restoring Amy to the spirit of the girl he first met.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Santa Claus and, to {{a lesser}} extent, the Easter Bunny, there are few details of the tooth fairy's {{appearance}} that are consistent in various versions of the myth. A 1984 study conducted by Rosemary Wells revealed that most, 74 percent of those surveyed, believed <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> to be female, while 12 percent believed <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> to be neither male nor female and 8 percent believed <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> could be either male or female. When asked about her findings regarding the tooth fairy's appearance, Wells explained - [...] "You've got your basic Tinkerbell-type tooth fairy with the wings, wand, a little older and whatnot. Then you have some people who think of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> as a man, or a bunny rabbit or a mouse." [...] One review of published children's books and popular artwork found <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> to also be depicted as a child with wings, a pixie, a dragon, a blue mother-figure, a flying ballerina, two little old men, a dental hygienist, a potbellied flying man smoking a cigar, a bat, a bear and others. Unlike the well-established imagining of Santa Claus, differences in renderings of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> are not as upsetting to children.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy</b> is {{a fantasy}} figure of early childhood.

50|$|While {{most of the}} beings {{created in}} Hogfather {{disappeared}} at the end, it is possible he remained because of the belief that Violet (a <b>tooth</b> <b>fairy)</b> had in him, in which case he may have begun a relationship with her, and started {{a career as a}} locum for gods that want a holiday. Alternatively, since it is impossible to die in <b>the</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>Fairy's</b> Castle, it is possible he remains there as he is unable to vanish from lack of belief.|$|R
