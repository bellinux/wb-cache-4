5|$|The {{diversity}} of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural {{tradition and the}} individuality of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> support the argument that <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> represent individual rulers. <b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of {{the region as a}} depiction of both rulership and their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen carved stone monuments were {{originally}} found at El Chal, {{all of which}} are badly eroded. Various monuments are broken into fragments. Only five stelae and three altars bore sculpted designs. The stelae exhibit a variety of forms but all the altars are circular. None of the hieroglyphic texts found on <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> of El Chal have yet been deciphered. The sculptural style of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> {{is similar to that of}} 8th century monuments from Sacul, Ucanal and Naranjo.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> of Seibal {{include a}} number of stelae, carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. <b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> at Seibal are {{fashioned}} from a hard limestone, accounting for their generally excellent preservation. During excavations in the 1960s, 57 stelae were identified. Of these 22 were sculpted and 35 were plain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the churchyard}} are twelve {{structures}} {{that have been}} listed at Grade II. These are: <b>the</b> Todd <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Rowan <b>Monument,</b> a mounting block, <b>the</b> Glasson <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Speight <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Drewsher <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Suder <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Sisson <b>Monument,</b> another Todd Monument, a Nicholson Monument, another Nicholson <b>Monument,</b> and <b>the</b> Walker <b>Monument.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since 1935 <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> is {{frequently}} damaged. Already twice <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> has been <b>the</b> {{target of a}} bomb attack, in 1967 and in 1984. One remarkable fact is that van Heutsz Junior protested against <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> of his father in 1943 because in his opinion <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> was too weak. After the attack in 1984 and the theft of the portrait of van Heutsz the peace returned around <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> until 1997, when the government wanted to renovate <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> <b>The</b> protests came back on and the government decided to only sand blast <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{decorative}} <b>monuments</b> in <b>the</b> park include: <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> of Friendship between Carrara and Yerevan, <b>the</b> Rebirth <b>monument,</b> <b>the</b> Waiting <b>monument</b> and <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> {{dedicated to}} Revived Armenia.|$|R
5|$|There {{also are}} various altars and sculptures used as {{decoration}} in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff {{compared to the}} naturalistic grace {{of the art of}} some other Maya sites. Traces of red pigment have been found on some of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> and most of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Government of Pakistan {{nominated}} {{the fort}} {{for inclusion in}} UNESCO World Heritage Site based on the criteria i, ii, and iii together with the Shalimar. In the fifth meeting session held in Sydney in October 1981, the World Heritage Site committee added both <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> to the list.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Damon {{appeared}} in a 20-second advertisement for Nespresso, directed by Grant Heslov, with whom he worked on <b>The</b> <b>Monuments</b> Men. The deal earned Damon $3 million.|$|E
5000|$|Both the {{settlement}} and <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> are in Mersin municipality area. But <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> is secluded in the citrus gardens at about [...] The {{road from the}} city center to <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> is about 12 km. The settlement is situated slightly {{to the north of}} <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b>|$|R
50|$|Visits to <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> {{are allowed}} during {{daylight}} hours, although visitors must ask for {{permission from the}} Iraqi soldiers who guard <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> before approaching <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b>|$|R
40|$|From sleeve: Poe - tomb. This {{photograph}} {{shows the}} front and right side of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> that marks Edgar Allan Poe's grave. <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> sits near <b>the</b> corner of two low brick walls that surround the graveyard. There are detailed engravings {{along the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> underneath <b>the</b> rounded edges. The front of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> features a bas-relief of Poe's face and upper body. Edgar Allan Poe is engraved underneath the bas-relief, near the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> A metal fence and a large building are visible behind <b>the</b> <b>monument...</b>|$|R
5|$|On April 15, 1954, the Yankees {{dedicated}} {{a plaque}} to Barrow; the plaque first {{hung on the}} center field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the flagpole and <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Miller Huggins. The plaques were later moved to the stadium's Monument Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> in the Alchi complex {{and in the}} other two villages in the Alchi group is not precise, in spite of many {{inscriptions}} and texts displayed on the walls.|$|E
5|$|Alchi is {{also part}} of the three villages (all in lower Ladakh region) which {{constitute}} the ‘Alchi group of monuments’; the other two villages adjoining Alchi are the Mangyu and Sumda Chun. <b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> in these three villages are stated to be of “unique style and workmanship’, but the Alchi monastic complex is the best known.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{memorials}} include <b>the</b> Frederick Keep <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Heurich Mausoleum, <b>the</b> Hitt <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Hardon <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Kauffman <b>Monument</b> that {{is known}} as The Seven Ages of Memory, the Sherwood Mausoleum Door, and <b>the</b> Thompson-Harding <b>Monument.</b>|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{postcard}} {{of a stone}} {{monument in}} Japan. A stone platform is the base for <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> There is a cement wall around the stones of <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> Four wrought iron gates are built into the cement. The stone of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> has three squares with writing in them. Trees and hillsides surround <b>the</b> <b>monument...</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 2009, a {{small fire}} {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> caused {{officials}} to question the structural integrity of <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> As of this time, <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> remains open to the public.|$|R
5|$|As of 2006, 304 stone monuments {{have been}} found at Takalik Abaj, mostly carved from local {{andesite}} boulders. Of these monuments 124 are carved with the remainder being plain; they are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups. The worked monuments {{can be divided into}} four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures, which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of <b>the</b> <b>monuments,</b> potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).|$|E
5|$|At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all {{date to the}} Late Preclassic. Stylistically, <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> {{are very}} similar to those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these {{represent}} complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).|$|E
5|$|Damon {{starred in}} the science fiction film Elysium (2013), where he played former car-thief-turned-factory-worker Max DeCosta. He also {{appeared}} in the science fiction movie The Zero Theorem by Terry Gilliam in 2013. In 2014, he starred in George Clooney's <b>The</b> <b>Monuments</b> Men, and played the minor role of scientist Dr. Mann, in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. In 2014, Damon appeared as a celebrity correspondent for Years of Living Dangerously.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>monument</b> was not {{immediately}} removed from the building for several reasons—pending legal hearings, <b>the</b> <b>monument's</b> weight, worries that <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> could break through the floor if it was taken outside intact, {{and a desire to}} avoid confrontation with protesters massed outside <b>the</b> structure. <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> was not actually removed from the state judicial building until July 19, 2004.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>monument</b> {{is located}} on the Colorado Plateau west of U.S. Highway 160, {{approximately}} [...] southwest of Cortez, Colorado. [...] <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> is centered at [...] [...] In addition to the four states, two semi-autonomous American Indian tribal governments have boundaries at <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> <b>the</b> Navajo Nation and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Reservation, with the Ute Mountain tribal boundaries coinciding with Colorado's boundaries at <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b>|$|R
50|$|Memorial events {{dedicated}} to Victory Day are traditionally held near <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> Veterans march through downtown to <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> {{where they are}} congratulated and banquet tables are arranged {{for them in the}} alleys near <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dating <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> remains {{difficult}} because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation. Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period (1500–1000BC) with some to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC) period. The smallest weigh 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons, although it was abandoned and left uncompleted close {{to the source of}} its stone.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during the}} Ramesside period, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs {{including}} one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, suggesting their continued use for cultic purposes until that point. Concurrently with these activities, extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken {{during the reign of}} Ramses II under the direction of prince Khaemweset. The sun temple of Nyuserre was among <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> benefiting from these works.|$|E
5|$|Maya stelae were {{worked with}} stone chisels and {{probably}} with wooden mallets. Hammerstones were fashioned from flint and basalt and {{were used for}} shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon <b>the</b> <b>monuments.</b>|$|E
50|$|On May 20, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> was vandalized {{with yellow}} paint {{covering}} the statue and anti-Ukrainian messages written over it. <b>The</b> <b>monument's</b> sculptor stated {{that this was}} the second time <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> was attacked by vandals.|$|R
5000|$|Franklin Simmons {{began the}} design and {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> in 1885, {{three years after the}} poet's death, with a pedestal designed by Francis H. Fassett. <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> was unveiled on September 29, 1888. [...] <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> is considered to be one of Simmons' major commissions. <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> was added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1990.|$|R

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> at Takalik Abaj are not {{in their}} {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons. An example {{is a series of}} four monuments found in a plaza in front of a Classic period platform, with {{at least two of the}} four (Altar12 and Monument23) dating to the Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period. <b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake and its precincts offer {{a plethora}} of monuments of {{national}} importance, such as the Pushkar city, the Brahma temple at Pushkar and the ghats {{on the periphery of}} the lakes. The lake is the central divine theme for the popularity of all <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> seen in the town and the fairs held here.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has also}} {{been referred to as}} <b>the</b> Soldier's <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Civil War <b>Monument,</b> <b>the</b> Ilsley <b>Monument,</b> and <b>the</b> Spanish American <b>Monument.</b>|$|R
50|$|Author of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> is Vojin Bakić. The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> {{was completed in}} 1981.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} {{continuing}} education program, the first virtual visitors this year were 26 people on indoor stationary bicycles in Ohio. They cycled, virtually, to <b>the</b> <b>Monument,</b> around <b>the</b> <b>Monument,</b> and from <b>the</b> <b>Monument,</b> while studying its rich history.|$|R
