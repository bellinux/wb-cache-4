40|$|To better {{understand}} the cellular target(s) of cyclosporin action in psoriasis, we have studied the effects of systemic short-term (7 d), low-dose (3 - 7. 5 mg/kg) cyclosporin A administration on {{the expression of the}} cytokines interleukin (IL) - 8 and IL- 1 β in psoriatic lesions. RNA blot hybridization analysis of pretreatment keratome biopsies revealed that expression of both cytokine mRNAs was highly variable from patient to patient. Significant covariation of both cytokine mRNA levels was noted (r = 0. 86, p < 0. 0001). However, there was no significant correlation between expression of either cytokine and clinical severity, as measured by the retreatment Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). IL- 1 β protein levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were highly correlated with IL- 1 β mRNA levels, indicating that <b>the</b> differences in <b>transcript</b> levels <b>accurately</b> <b>reflect</b> differences in epidermal cytokine protein. Significant reductions in both cytokine transcripts and in IL- 1 β immunoreactive protein were noted in the high expression subgroup after 1 week of cyclosporin A therapy, prior to detectable clinical improvement. In contrast to its pronounced effects on epidermal cytokine expression in vivo and the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction in vitro, cyclosporine A did not inhibit the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 or IL- 8 mRNAs by cultured keratinocytes in response to IL- 1 β or the combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interferon (IFN) -β. These data suggest that epidermal keratinocytes respond to signals produced by activated T cells by coordinate expression of multiple cytokines, and that cyclosporin A acts primarily through blockade of T cells, rather than through keratinocyte activation...|$|R
40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild-type accessions Col and N 1438) were {{submitted}} to a prolonged, mild salt stress using two types of protocols. These protocols allowed salt-treated plants to absorb nutrients either through {{a part of their}} root system maintained in control medium (split-rooted plants) or during episodes on control medium alternating with salt application (salt alternation experiment). Full-salt treatments (salt applied continuously to whole root system) resulted in severe (but non-lethal) growth inhibition. This effect was partly alleviated in split-rooted plants on mixed salt–control medium and in plants submitted to salt–control medium alternation. The activity of the various isoforms of superoxide dismutases (SODs) did not appreciably change with the treatments. The abundance of the mRNAs of the seven SOD genes present in Arabidopsis genome was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The two protocols gave qualitatively identical results. The expression level was increased by full-salt treatments for some genes and diminished for other genes. However, the nature of these genes differed according to the accessions: the responses to salt of FSD 1 and MSD were opposite in Col and N 1438. In Col, salt treatments inhibited the expression of FSD 1 and strongly stimulated that of CSD 1 andMSD. InN 1438, the stimulation by salt concerned FSD 1 and CSD 1 and MSD expression being inhibited. In both accessions, the expression of CSD 2 and CSD 3 was lowered by salt. For all genes, the treatments that mitigated stress partially restored SOD expression to control level. Thus, the changes in SOD <b>transcript</b> abundance <b>accurately</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> severity of the salt stress...|$|R
