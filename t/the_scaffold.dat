25|$|A molding {{technique}} {{was created by}} Wang et al. for forming a nerve guidance conduit with a multi-channel inner matrix and an outer tube wall from chitosan. In their 2006 study, Wang et al. threaded acupuncture needles through a hollow chitosan tube, where they are {{held in place by}} fixing, on either end, patches created using CAD. A chitosan solution is then injected into the tube and solidified, after which the needles are removed, creating longitudinally oriented channels. A representative scaffold was then created for characterization with 21 channels using acupuncture needles of 400µm in diameter. Upon investigation under a microscope, the channels were found to be approximately circular with slight irregularities; all channels were aligned with the inner diameter of the outer tube wall. It was confirmed by micro-CT imaging that the channels went through the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>scaffold.</b> Under water absorption, the inner and outer diameters of <b>the</b> <b>scaffold</b> became larger, but the channel diameters did not vary significantly, which is necessary for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>scaffold</b> shape that guides neurite extension.

This novel combination enhanced the tensile strength of <b>the</b> <b>scaffolds</b> from 0. 70 N/g for uncrosslinked scaffolds to 2. 2 N/g for crosslinked ones; <b>the</b> crosslinked <b>scaffolds</b> also exhibited slower degradation rates.
