5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved the publication of <b>the</b> <b>Adoption</b> (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend <b>the</b> <b>Adoption</b> Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> process, among many other reforms to <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming <b>the</b> <b>Adoption</b> (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a symmetric model {{composed of two}} countries and a firm in each country. Firms produce the same good {{by means of a}} polluting technology that uses fossil energy. However, these firms can adopt a clean technology that uses a renewable energy and that has a lower unit cost. Surprisingly, opening markets to international competition increases the per-unit emission-tax and decreases the per-unit production subsidy. Interestingly, <b>the</b> socially-optimal <b>adoption</b> date under a common market better internalizes transboundary pollution than that under autarky, and than <b>the</b> optimal <b>adoption</b> date of regulated firms. However, <b>the</b> optimal <b>adoption</b> date of non-regulated firms completely don't internalize transboundary pollution. In autarky (resp. a common market), regulated firms adopt earlier (resp. later) than what is socially-optimal, whereas non-regulated firms adopt later than <b>the</b> socially-optimal <b>adoption</b> date and than <b>the</b> optimal <b>adoption</b> date of regulated firms. Therefore, in autarky (resp. a common market) regulators can induce firms to adopt at <b>the</b> socially-optimal <b>adoption</b> date by giving them postpone (resp. speed up) adoption subsidies. Opening markets to international trade, speeds up <b>the</b> socially-optimal <b>adoption</b> date and delays optimal adoption dates of regulated and non-regulated firms. ...|$|R
