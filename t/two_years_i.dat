25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|Her work at {{art school}} began to suffer, and {{teachers}} {{told her the}} relationship with Lennon was doing her no good. Lennon continued to be casually inconsiderate towards her, later saying, [...] "I was in sort of a blind rage for <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> was either drunk or fighting. It had been the same with other girl friends I'd had. There was something the matter with me." [...] Tony Bramwell—a friend of Lennon's since his youth—later said: [...] "Cynthia was beautiful, physically, and on the inside. Although she knew he [...] was apt to find love on the road, she was totally dedicated to his success... and extremely influential. He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up, to buttress, sort of, his weak side." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, Tarwater trained at Michigan with Phelps, Peter Vanderkaay, and Erik Vendt, coached by Bowman and Urbanchekf. Shortly before the trials, he went the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado to train at altitude. [...] "I'm better mentally than I've ever been," [...] Tarwater said of his preparation. [...] "Physically I'm stronger than four years ago." [...] He entered the Trials as the number two seed in the 200-meter butterfly and was widely expected to make the U.S. Olympic team as the second qualifier behind Phelps. [...] "For the last <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have completely put everything in my life aside {{to try to make}} [...] dream come true," [...] he told a reporter. He also entered the trials as the fourth seed in the 100-meter butterfly and qualified for the 100- and 200-meter freestyle.|$|E

500|$|Stevenage's league {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{a typically}} patchy start; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season. Following a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009, the team went on a 17-game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009, propelling the club into the top two. Unlike in previous seasons, the club were performing strongly away from home, and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town. A 4–1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top-spot {{for the first time in}} the season. However, two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight–point lead going into March 2010. The team responded well, winning eight games on the bounce; including an important 1–0 victory over Oxford United in late March, subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table. Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town, securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal, and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures. Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games, winning the league by 11 points, with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division. The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history, as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career. Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final; this time losing 2–1 after extra-time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium. At the end of the season, Westley signed a new two-year contract; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012. On signing the new deal, Westley said [...] "I am grateful for all the support that we have all been given in the past <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> am delighted to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League". In his first two seasons back at the club, from May 2008 to May 2010, Westley has been in charge for 114 games, winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61.40%.|$|E
2500|$|Critics also {{identified}} problems with Bellesiles's methods of citation. [...] Cramer noted that Bellesiles had misrepresented a passage by George Washington {{about the quality}} of three poorly prepared militia units as if his criticism applied to the militia in general. (Washington had noted that the three units were exceptions to the rule.) Cramer wrote, [...] "It took me twelve hours of hunting before I found a citation that was completely correct. In the intervening <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> have spent thousands of hours chasing down Bellesiles’s citations, and I have found many hundreds of shockingly gross falsifications." ...|$|E

Whilst on board the Beagle I was quite orthodox, & I {{remember}} being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. I suppose it was the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, {{to see that the}} Old Testament from its manifestly false history of the world, with the Tower of Babel, rainbow as a sign, etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2017 {{the mosque}} and others complained to Pride London about {{placards}} displayed in their march by the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain (CEMB), claiming they were Islamophobic. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell defended the CEMB and criticised the mosque's record on homophobia, writing [...] "In the last <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> and my colleagues [...] at the Peter Tatchell Foundation have 11 times contacted the mosque and LMC, requesting [...] {{them to have}} a dialogue with the LGBT community: to build bridges and [...] solidarity between LGBTs and Muslims to combat the prejudice, discrimination [...] and violence that both communities suffer. All our requests have been rebuffed. [...] In reply, the mosque stated it had met with LGBT groups, and also with Tatchell himself in 2012.|$|E

[...] He replied, [...] "My family has been living in the west for generations. I took the imperial edict to build the stupa in Tibet for <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> saw constant wars there, and wish Your Majesty could pacify there. I come for sentient beings."

The track, which epitomizes the lyrical content of 21, summarizes the now defunct relationship that the record is all about. Adele has openly discussed the genesis of it saying, [...] "Well, I wrote that song because I was exhausted from being such a bitch, with 'Rolling in the Deep' or 'Rumour Has It' ... I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> spent with him.
