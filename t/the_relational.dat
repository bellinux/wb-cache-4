Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies <b>the</b> <b>relational</b> character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of dealing with data {{inconsistencies}} while integrating data sets derived from multiple autonomous <b>relational</b> databases. <b>The</b> fundamental assumption in <b>the</b> classical <b>relational</b> model is that data is consistent and hence no support is provided for dealing with inconsistent data. Due to this limitation of <b>the</b> classical <b>relational</b> model, <b>the</b> semantics for detecting, representing, and manipulating inconsistent data have to be explicitly encoded in the applications by the application developer. In this paper, we propose <b>the</b> flexible <b>relational</b> model, which extends <b>the</b> classical <b>relational</b> model by providing support for inconsistent data. We present a flexible relation algebra, which provides semantics for database operations in the presence of potentially inconsistent data. Finally, we discuss issues raised for query optimization when the data may be inconsistent. ...|$|R

As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.|$|E

25|$|While in an organization, it is {{important}} to focus on traits and functionalities of leaders from within, it is also key to focus on <b>the</b> <b>relational</b> side of leadership. Being relational with leaders/followers allows for relationships to be built. While looking at the two different models (vertical dyad linkage theory and leader–member exchange theory), different perspectives from each side are gained. For an organization to be democratic, the LMX theory supports the claims of it. The influence of VDL model helped get LMX theory to where it is today. Usually the assumption is leaders can only build close relations with trusted assistants due to lack of time and resources. Leaders developing relations usually results in partnerships with certain followers, but leaders have the responsibility to make relations and offer partnerships to all of the followers (Hackman & Johnson, 2009, pg. 94). Making partnerships with all of the followers will increase the performance of the organization as a whole. Once this relation is built a relation trust is built and more information is able to be revealed to the organization leader.|$|E
