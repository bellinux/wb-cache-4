Prosecutors, however, said the tape was legal and was made in a face-to-face meeting with Anderson. Although Judge Alsup dismissed Anderson's tape claim and others, the 9th Circuit Court sent Anderson's appeal back to the judge, saying Alsup's ruling regarding the tape was not clear enough. In clarifying his order, Alsup said he agreed with prosecutors that there was ample evidence beyond the tape to question Anderson. Prosecutors also said <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> wanted answered were based on athletes' secret testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case and a search of Anderson's house that turned up drug records, some with Bonds' name on it. Other than the tape dispute, the 9th Circuit Court had rejected the merits of Anderson's appeal.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models and <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation. He wrote that since Bell et al.′s study, research into the [...] "social causes of homosexuality" [...] has become [...] "moribund." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{problems}} on both extremes {{of the gun}} transmission debate. Its proponents emphasize the older history of gunpowder evolution as attested by historical records and archaeological samples in China, its less obviously militarily focused name as [...] "fire medicine," [...] the Mongol role as a catalyst in disseminating gunpowder technology, and criticizes the scant or absent evidence of prior experimentation with gunpowder in Europe for non-military purposes {{before the arrival of}} the gun. However, there are still several blanks in the history of a gun transmission theory and <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> raise which its proponents have been unable to answer. The rapid spread of guns across Eurasia, only 50 years from China to Europe, with non-existent evidence of its route from one extreme of the continent to the other, remains a mystery. Other Chinese inventions such as the compass, paper, and printing took centuries to reach Europe, with events such as the Battle of Talas as perhaps a possible takeoff point for discussion. No such event exists on record for either gunpowder or the gun. There is simply no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that [...] "there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China." [...] A conclusion most military historians in the transmission camp have come to is that the rapid diffusion of gunpowder and the gun is probably best explained by its clear military applications.|$|E

Resolving, according to his own story, to go down for the night where Mother Simpson {{would give him a}} lodging for old acquaintance' sake, he had just got clear of the avenue, and into the old wood, as it was called, though it was now used as a pasture-ground rather than woodland, when he suddenly lighted on a drove of Scotch cattle, which were lying there to repose themselves after the day's journey. At this Andrew was in no way surprised, it being the well-known custom of his countrymen, who take care of those droves, to quarter themselves after night upon the best unenclosed grass-ground they can find, and depart before day-break to escape paying for their night's lodgings. But he was both surprised and startled, when a Highlander, springing up, accused him of disturbing the cattle, and refused him to pass forward till he had spoken to his master.

He had been out but little since the day on which he had been so savagely treated at Drumleesh--indeed he {{had not been able to}} go out till quite lately; and he now most thoroughly wished that he was bad enough to obtain a medical certificate, which would prevent the necessity of his attending in court.

Regard for his oath he had none; but there were some most disagreeable questions which, if asked him, he would be obliged to answer with the truth, for on those subjects he would be unable to lie without detection.

60|$|Not one {{of these}} {{questions}} differs at all in intellectual purport or in intellectual value from the question which I have quoted from the purple poster, or {{from any of the}} typical questions asked by half of the earnest economists of our times. All <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> ask are of this character; they are all tinged with this same initial absurdity. They do not ask if the means is suited to the end; they all ask (with profound and penetrating scepticism) if the end is suited to the means. They do not ask whether the tail suits the dog. They all ask whether a dog is (by the highest artistic canons) the most ornamental appendage that can be put {{at the end of a}} tail. In short, instead of asking whether our modern arrangements, our streets, trades, bargains, laws, and concrete institutions are suited to the primal and permanent idea of a healthy human life, they never admit that healthy human life into the discussion at all, except suddenly and accidentally at odd moments; and then they only ask whether that healthy human life is suited to our streets and trades. Perfection may be attainable or unattainable as an end. It may or may not be possible to talk of imperfection as a means to perfection. But surely it passes toleration to talk of perfection as a means to imperfection. The New Jerusalem may be a reality. It may be a dream.

After much consideration, he answered: [...] "You tell me yourself that the Beast, frightful as he is, loves you dearly, and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness; I think the Prince must mean you to understand that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to, in spite of his ugliness." ...|$|E
