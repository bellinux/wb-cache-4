50|$|Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Love is a 1936 melodrama film {{directed}} by Edward H. Griffith and starring Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart and Ray Milland. The adapted screenplay was by Melville Baker, with an uncredited Preston Sturges and Doris Anderson, based on Ursula Parrott's 1935 novel Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Live, which was serialized before publication as Say Goodbye Again. The film {{is also known}} as Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Live in the U.K.|$|R

There were a couple of <b>times</b> <b>we</b> got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry.

For our private needs, {{there were only three}} chamberpots. They had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing our clothes. We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us {{in a constant state of}} dysentery. We were all in a deplorable state.

50|$|Ursula Parrott was {{a popular}} novelist of the time, several of whose novels were turned into films, most {{prominently}} Ex-Wife which became the 1930 movie The Divorcee. The story which provided the source material for Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Love was first serialized as Say Goodbye Again in McCall's from December 1934 to April 1935, and was then published as a novel called Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Live, which was also the working title of the film. There was debate about what to call the movie, with studio executives concerned that a motion picture entitled Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Live might be misinterpreted as being about reincarnation, while director Edward H. Griffith wanted to avoid losing the publicity value of using the novel's title. Although the film was released as Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Love, the alternate title Next <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Live was used for its British release.|$|R

25|$|The {{notebook}} Kid receives {{already has}} writing throughout, {{but only on}} the right hand pages. The left hand pages are blank. Glimpses of the text in the notebook, however, are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself, as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren. It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems. The novel describes {{the process of creating}} the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several <b>times.</b> <b>We</b> never see the actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.|$|E
25|$|When {{a vacancy}} occurred, {{the bishop of}} the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of {{election}} was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to Rome. It was necessary that an abbot {{should be at least}} 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later <b>times</b> <b>we</b> have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached {{on the rights of the}} monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.|$|E

After a two-week break for international matches, Benfica's season resumed on 20 October with a League Cup match against Vitória de Setúbal. Camacho made many changes in the starting eleven, which nearly cost him the game. A 12th-minute Setúbal goal was not matched until the 94th minute, by Freddy Adu.|$|E

On 13 June 2014, Zinta filed a complaint to the Mumbai police against Ness Wadia alleging he had molested, threatened and abused her at an IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 30 May.
