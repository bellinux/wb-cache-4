5|$|The {{follicular}} {{phase is}} {{the first part of}} the ovarian cycle. During <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg. The latter part of <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.|$|E
5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} during <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> {{of the evolution}} of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.|$|E
50|$|Finally, as {{the current}} spreads even further, it becomes so thin that viscous forces between the intruding fluid and the ambient and {{boundaries}} govern the flow. In <b>this</b> <b>phases</b> no more mixing occurs and the propagation rate slows down even more.|$|R
50|$|Middenwaard {{was built}} in five phases. Construction began in 1974, while the last phase was {{completed}} in 2008. Because of <b>this</b> <b>phased</b> development, the shopping centre has an odd external and internal appearance. Meanwhile Middenwaard has been renovated and has an unambiguous appearance nowadays.|$|R

5|$|Delaroche's {{early works}} had {{been based on}} topics from the Bible's Old Testament, but {{gradually}} his interests switched to painting scenes from English and French history. He 'combined colouristic skill {{with an interest in}} detailed scenes from history'.Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, which was painted roughly eight years before Delaroche's death, exemplifies <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> in Delaroche's career.|$|E
5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they {{do not seem to}} have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, low-lying casemates {{were added to}} the western and southwestern {{curtains}} to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The building technique used in <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and technical expertise. Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected during <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E

The first round was judges by independent judges to choose the best talent and brought them to Jakarta to meet the 3 judges. <b>This</b> <b>phases</b> made 450 best talent going to Jakarta to the next round.|$|R
5|$|Probably due to {{increased}} convergence rates of the Nazca and South America plates for the past 28 million years, a phase of strong volcanic activity commenced in the Andes 25 million years ago. It is likely that <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> persisted without interruption until today.|$|E
5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth or}} proliferative phase, {{during which the}} body {{produces}} cells and protein to heal the puncture and the edges contract around the piercing, forming a tunnel of scar tissue called a fistula. <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> may last weeks, months, or longer than a year.|$|E

5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E
5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her {{to the work of}} David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E
5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation during <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August21.|$|E

50|$|In {{invertebrate}} smooth muscle, contraction is initiated {{with the}} binding of calcium directly to myosin and then rapidly cycling cross-bridges, generating force. Similar to {{the mechanism of}} vertebrate smooth muscle, there is a low calcium and low energy utilization catch <b>phase.</b> <b>This</b> sustained <b>phase</b> or catch phase {{has been attributed to}} a catch protein that has similarities to myosin light-chain kinase and the elastic protein-titin called twitchin. Clams and other bivalve mollusks use <b>this</b> catch <b>phase</b> of smooth muscle to keep their shell closed for prolonged periods with little energy usage.|$|R
25|$|Chronic aortic {{insufficiency}} If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left ventricular filling pressures will revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In <b>this</b> compensated <b>phase,</b> the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase.Some individuals enter <b>this</b> decompensated <b>phase</b> asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic valve replacement prior to <b>this</b> decompensation <b>phase.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. At the end of <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> orogenic <b>phase</b> {{began in}} the Late Pliocene and {{continued}} in the Pleistocene. The Pasadenian orogeny {{is the most important}} phase in forging the current shape of Iran. Some younger orogenic events might be the continuation of <b>this</b> orogenic <b>phase</b> (e.g., Alborz-Azerbaijan axis, Zagros, Central Iran). Sahand, Sabalan, Damavand, Bazman and Taftan were mainly formed during the volcanism of <b>this</b> orogenic <b>phase.</b> With an elevation of 5,610 metres, Mount Damavand is the highest peak in Iran. This volcano first erupted in the Pleistocene about 1.78 million years ago and after several known eruptions around 600,000 and 280,000 years ago, it finally erupted in the Holocene almost 7300 years ago.|$|R

5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. During <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as core team members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order they choose, and the introduction of the item rental system.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a convincing}} victory at Killiecrankie, his army took heavy losses and Dundee himself was killed. Without his {{leadership}} and divided by a quarrel between the leaders {{that led to}} a significant segment of the survivors leaving, the remaining Jacobite force was defeated in August at the Battle of Dunkeld, by a newly raised government regiment of Cameronians. The last remnants surrendered after the Battle of Cromdale in Strathspey on 1 May 1690, ending <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> of Jacobite resistance in Scotland.|$|E
