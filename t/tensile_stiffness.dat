On increasing the pre-stretch ratio within the range of this critical value, both <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> and tensile strength increase.

The laminates of Kevlar fiber reinforced polymer (KFRP), glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) and hybrid of Kevlar-glass fiber reinforced polymer (KGFRP) were fabricated using a vacuum bagging process. Three different ratios of Kevlar to glass fiber plies were prepared in this study which were 20 : 80, 50 : 50, and 80 : 20.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a numerical method to predict soil-geotextile inter-face friction parameters. A strain softening model {{was used to}} simulate the relationship between shear stress and horizontal displacement at the soil-geotextile interface. Pull-out tests were performed on two types of geotextile, with different <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffnesses,</b> embedded in a granular soil. For each geotextile, pull-out tests were performed at con-fining pressures of 20, 50, 100, and 200 kPa. It was found that, unless breakage of the geotextile occurs, the peak pull-out force occurs after a small displacement of the free end of the geotextile. At the peak pull-out force, the maximum shear stress occurs near the free end of the geotextile while the shear stress at the loaded end is at or near a residu-al value. The use of an average interface friction angle overestimates pull-out resist-ance. The numerical technique developed in this paper provides more accurate values for soil-geotextile interface friction parameters...|$|R

40|$|ACL injury {{prevention}} programs often involve strengthening the knee muscles. We posit that an unrecognized benefit of such training is the associated {{increase in the}} <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the hypertrophied muscle. We tested the hypothesis that an increased quadriceps <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> would reduce peak anteromedial bundle (AM‐) ACL relative strain in female knees. Twelve female cadaver knees were subjected to compound impulsive two‐times body weight loads in compression, flexion, and internal tibial torque beginning at 15 ° flexion. Knees were equipped with modifiable custom springs to represent the nonlinear rapid stretch behavior of a normal and increased stiffness female quadriceps (i. e., 33 % greater stiffness). Peak AM‐ACL relative strain was measured using an in situ transducer while muscle forces and tibiofemoral kinematics and kinetics were recorded. A 3 D ADAMS™ dynamic biomechanical knee model was used in silico to interpret the experimental results which were analyzed using a repeated‐measures Wilcoxon test. Female knees exhibited a 16 % reduction in peak AM‐ACL relative strain and 21 % reduction in change in flexion when quadriceps <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> was increased by 33 % (mean (SD) difference: 0. 97 % (0. 65 %), p [*]=[*] 0. 003).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of large-scale numerical modeling of cellular mattress-reinforced fly ash beds overlying soft clay using a finite-element program. The cellular mattress was a honeycomb structure consisting of interconnected multiple circular cells. The influence of the height, diameter, and <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the cell and the width of the entire mattress on the pressure-settlement response of footing, surface deformation during footing settlement, and mobilization of hoop tension in the cell walls are illustrated. Results from the numerical analyses indicate an improvement in footing capacity of approximately 1. 4 times greater over fly ash bed by inclusion of a single geotextile separator representing jute geotextile in between the fly ash bed and underlying clay. The cellular mattress-fly ash composite bed produced an approximately sevenfold increment in the footing capacity compared with the unreinforced fly ash bed both in presence of the jute separator. The mattress-reinforced beds produced better footing capacity with an increase in the height and width of the mattress and the <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the cell wall. It is satisfactory to acquire the optimization for the height and width of mattress and the <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the cell wall. For a particular mattress width and height, the footing capacity increased with a reduction in the cell diameter. The cell at the mattress center mobilized maximum hoop tension that was lesser in the cells successively toward the mattress periphery.

In the delaminated zone the sublaminates are modelled by two beam crosses stacked one over another and coupled at the delamination front.

The lengths of the extended beams and an enlargement factor for their <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> are the free parameters of the model, which may be adapted later on to 3 D-analysis. The beams are stretched at the grip-ends according to the deformations of the undamaged structure.

H 577 M ISE 2015 Chanxi, 152 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmBecause of {{the unique}} {{properties}} as smart material and the biocompatibility, near-equiatomic nickel titanium (NiTi) was widely applied in making biomedical devices. Further improvements in the tribological and mechanical properties of NiTi could bring benefit in improving biocompatibility and durability of these devices. Various surface modification techniques such as PVD, CVD, plasma spraying, etc., have been developed and applied on NiTi over years but all of these techniques have different limitations such as poor interfacial bonding at the surface and long production time. This project investigates the feasibility of applying laser gas nitriding technique to improve the <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness,</b> wear resistance and corrosion resistance of nickel titanium (NiTi). In the present work, a continuous wave fibre laser was applied to perform laser gas nitriding process under a pure nitrogen environment on the substrate of commercial NiTi plates. A Taguchi analysis was implemented in this project to optimize the process parameters for laser gas nitriding. Optimum parameters for nitriding in terms of output power, scanning speed, beam diameter and nitrogen flow rate were obtained. The optimum set of process parameter for laser gas nitriding was subsequently applied to fabricate titanium nitride (TiN) tracks on surface of NiTi with hardness more than 700 HV. With the optimized parameters, different thickness of TiN single track could be produced at {{the surface of the}} NiTi alloy using laser gas nitriding. Two schemes of combining single TiN tracks were investigated: a) parallel longitudinal tracks for studying the effect of laser gas nitriding on the <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> of NiTi; b) network grid for studying the effect of laser gas nitriding on wear and corrosion resistance of NiTi. The results from scheme (a) indicate that the amount of TiN surface coverage may not be a linear relationship with the increase of the <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the NiTi. Sample with 40 % TiN surface coverage has the highest <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness.</b> Using scheme (b), with a 47 % and 76 % grid surface coverage, the average wearing volume are 0. 00495 μm² and 0. 00859 μm² respectively less than that of the untreated NiTi. The corrosion resistance of the NiTi is enhanced as well. The icorr for untreated, 47 % and 76 % grid surface coverage was 0. 5 μA/cm² and 0. 34 μA/cm² respectively. It could be concluded that reinforcement tracks or grid of TiN by laser gas nitriding could be effective in improving the <b>tensile</b> <b>stiffness,</b> wear and corrosion properties of NiTi. These innovative surfacing schemes enable NiTi to be treated in an efficient and more economical way. Department of Industrial and Systems EngineeringM.
