5|$|The game {{begins in}} a New Republic outpost where Katarn is {{training}} Jade, when Imperial forces attack the base. The player takes control of Katarn {{to defend the}} base from the stormtroopers and get to <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center.</b> Once there, it is revealed that an evacuation cannot take place because of bombardment by large weapons from two nearby asteroids. Katarn leaves Jade behind as he travels to the asteroids to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, Sub-Commander T'Pol {{is called}} to <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> by Captain Archer. Archer tells her that he has located a nearby planet that the Xindi {{recently}} visited. Both then travel down to the surface with Lieutenant Reed and Ensign Sato. They discover a Xindi shuttle along with two dead crewmembers, one of whom has been incinerated. With little warning, Archer, Sato and Reed suddenly begin to transform physically into a new species, but T'Pol seems somehow resistant to the changes.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E

5000|$|Many Colortrak 2000, Lyceum, and Dimensia TVs came {{packaged}} with a {{very large}} remote control, <b>the</b> Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Center.</b> There are several different versions of <b>the</b> Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Center,</b> but a main feature was that it could control an array of selected RCA components, all with the one remote - a universal remote only for RCA products, so to speak. The Dimensia version of the remote was called the [...] "Dimensia-Intelligent Audio Video" [...] and had identical buttons to <b>the</b> Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|R
5|$|In November 1944, Company C {{provided}} {{security to}} {{the headquarters of the}} Seventh United States Army. The rest of the First Battalion was assigned other tasks, such as defending <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Center</b> of the Sixth United States Army Group. The Second and Third Battalions were assigned to defend communications. In 1948, seven members received the Bronze Star for their service in World War II. On 13 December 1944, the 65th Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Juan César Cordero Dávila, relieved the 2nd Battalion of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, a regiment which was made up of Japanese Americans under the command of Col. Virgil R. Miller, a native of San Germán, Puerto Rico and former member of the 65th Infantry Regiment.|$|E

25|$|Bennett Hatfield {{confirmed}} the miscommunication {{at a press}} conference shortly thereafter. Initial information indicated that the miscommunication occurred between the rescue team in the mine and <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> at the surface. According to Hatfield, several personnel at the center were able to simultaneously hear the communications directly from the rescue team. Because of the state regulatory officials on site, both company and state officials, including representatives from the governor's office, were present at <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center.</b> Hatfield estimated that 15–20 minutes elapsed before they learned that there was in fact a miscommunication.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Center</b> was a {{very large}} remote control {{introduced}} for RCA's high-end television sets; in 1983 for the Colortrak 2000 and the SJT400 CED player and in 1984 for the Dimensia Lyceum TV sets. The main feature of <b>the</b> Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Center</b> {{was that it was}} universal amongst many RCA components, including VCRs, CED players, tuners, amplifiers, CD players, etc., on top of controlling the monitor itself. <b>The</b> Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Center</b> took four AA batteries to power, which is understandable, considering its extensive and ahead-of-its time functionality.|$|R

25|$|The Virginia {{class is}} the first to utilize {{photonic}} sensors instead of a traditional periscope: the class is equipped with high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared laser rangefinder, and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Two redundant sets of these sensors are mounted on two AN/BVS-1 photonics masts located outside the pressure hull. Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through optical fiber data lines through signal processors to the control center. Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on liquid-crystal display interfaces in <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> of the Galeos, Dauragon {{explains}} {{that he plans to}} provide unlimited energy to those who will follow him and destroy those who will not. The trio attack and kill him, releasing Dominique from the computer. If Kaldea survived the previous fight, she tells them the Galeos is designed to split into two after leaving Earth. She leads them to the back half of the ship, and sacrifices herself to save Sion and Dominique. The front half of the ship rams and destroys the satellite, with the back half returning safely to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Pieces of {{wreckage}} {{were transported}} by boat to shore {{and then by}} truck to leased hangar space at the former Grumman Aircraft facility in Calverton, New York, for storage, examination, and reconstruction. This facility became <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> and headquarters for the investigation. NTSB and FBI personnel were present to observe all transfers to preserve the evidentiary value of the wreckage. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered by U.S. Navy divers 1 week after the accident; they were immediately shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for readout. The victims' remains were transported to the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's Office in Hauppauge, New York.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war there}} was {{military}} agreement that Bardufoss {{should be the}} main air station for Northern Norway, and Bodø would not station any aircraft. The air force saw the strategic advantage of a second air station in Northern Norway, although it was at first the civilian needs for an airport that were most interested in an upgrade of Bodø. By 1949, internal notes within the air force were discussing the possibilities of moving <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> {{for the air force}} in Northern Norway to Bodø. During 1948, following incidents such as the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948, the Berlin Blockade and increased Soviet pressure on Finland, the Norwegian government increased military spending and Norway became a founding member of NATO the following year.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} that the Akıncı AFB was <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> of the pro-coup military. At 22:00 hours local time on July 15, 2016, Akın Öztürk, a four-star General in the Turkish Air Force {{and a member of}} the Supreme Military Council, who served as the 30th Commander of the Turkish Air Force between 2013 and 2015, {{reportedly}} started the coup d'état in Ankara by ordering of F-16 jet fighters of the 141st squadron to take off. The operation was led by Air Pilot Staff Lieutenant colonel Hakan Karakuş, who is the son-in-law of Akın Öztürk. The personnel of the 141st squadron had been sent home in the afternoon with the remark that their duty terminated earlier on that day.|$|E

25|$|In {{large-scale}} galley-to-galley engagements, tactics remained {{essentially the}} same {{until the end of}} the 16th century. Cannons and small firearms were introduced around the 14th century, but did not have immediate effects on tactics; the same basic crescent formation in line abreast that was employed at the battle of Lepanto in 1571 was used by the Byzantine fleet almost a millennium earlier. Artillery on early gun galleys was not used as a long-range standoff weapon against other gun-armed ships. The maximum distance at which contemporary cannons were effective, c. 500m (1600ft), could be covered by a galley in about two minutes, much faster than the reload time of any heavy artillery. Gun crews would therefore hold their fire until the last possible moment, somewhat similar to infantry tactics in the pre-industrial era of short range firearms. The weak points of a galley remained the sides and especially the rear, <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center.</b> Unless one side managed to outmaneuver the other, battle would be met with ships crashing into each other head on. Once fighting began with ships locking on to one another bow to bow, the fighting would be fought over the front line ships. Unless a galley was completely overrun by an enemy boarding party, fresh troops could be fed into the fight from reserve vessels in the rear.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Space" [...] after reading about news of the [...] "face on Mars"—an instance of pareidolia wherein a mound in the Cydonia region of Mars was taken to resemble a human face.

The new Infiltration Surveillance Center (ISC) was located at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, nine miles (14km) west of Nakhon Phanom city {{on the banks of the}} Mekong River. The first commander of the unit was Air Force Brigadier General William P. McBride, whose superior was the deputy commander of the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force at Udon Thani, Thailand. From its creation the ISC (and the operations conducted from it) was known as Task Force Alpha.|$|E

There, he finds a note, written in the series' Standard Galactic Alphabet cypher, from the final boss of the Vorticons trilogy: his school rival Mortimer McMire, whose IQ is [...] "a single point higher" [...] than Keen's. The note tells Keen that the McMire killed in the previous game was an android replica, that the [...] "Gannalech" [...] is a mispronunciation of [...] "Grand Intellect", his title from the first trilogy, and that the Armageddon Machine was itself a distraction, as McMire plans on destroying the universe instead.

500|$|Two {{people on}} the {{aircraft}} made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six persons, and staff and passengers had been moved {{to the rear of}} the airplane. May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking. Between 09:16 and 09:26, passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the airplane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. She reported that the passengers, including the pilots, had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call. A minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. Theodore Olson contacted <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>center</b> at the Department of Justice, and tried unsuccessfully to contact Attorney General John Ashcroft. About five minutes later, Barbara Olson called again, told her husband that the [...] "pilot" [...] (possibly Hanjour on the cabin intercom) had announced the flight was hijacked, and asked, [...] "What do I tell the pilot to do?" [...] Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying low over a residential area. He told her of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Soon afterward, the call cut off again.|$|E
