40|$|Situational {{judgment}} {{tests are}} personnel selection instruments that present job applicants with work-related situations and possible {{responses to the}} situations. The response instructions are of two types: behavioral tendency and knowledge. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions ask respondents to identify how they would likely behave in the situation. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> knowledge instructions ask respondents {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of possible responses to the situation. Results showed that the response instructions influenced the constructs measured by the <b>tests.</b> <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> knowledge instructions had higher magnitude correlations with cognitive ability than <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions showed higher correlations than those with knowledge instructions for the personality constructs conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> knowledge instructions showed higher criterion-related validity than <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions.

40|$|Disk {{diffusion}} tests, inoculated {{directly from}} positive blood cultures, were evaluated for accuracy of reading zone diameters after 4 - and 6 -h and overnight incubation. In comparisons with results from standard disk diffusion tests, the 4 -h results were in agreement for 83 % of <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-positive organisms and 64 % of <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. When minor discrepancies were ignored, the 4 -h readings were in agreement for 98 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-positive organisms and 95 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. After 6 h of incubation, 91 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-positive organisms and 86 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms agreed with standard results. The agreement was 99 % for <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms when minor discrepancies were excluded. Very major discrepancies occurred in two tests (0. 1 %) with gram-positive organisms {{and were not}} observed in <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. The frequencies of major discrepancies were 3. 5 % after 4 h, 0. 6 % after 6 h, and 0. 7 % after overnight incubation. Ampicillin and cephalothin <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. accounted for 81 % of the major discrepancies in <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. Oxacillin tests {{accounted for more than}} half of the major discrepancies in <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> staphylococci. The results of this study, which did not include the newer antibiotics, indicate that direct susceptibility tests from blood cultures read after 6 h of incubation are more reliable than 4 -h results and produce less than 1 % major errors in comparisons <b>with</b> standard susceptibility <b>tests...</b>|$|R

5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft.

The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions.

5|$|Further {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} include precision measurements of the Shapiro effect or gravitational time delay for light, most recently in 2002 by the Cassini space probe. One set of tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of gyroscopes travelling through space. One of these effects, geodetic precession, has been <b>tested</b> <b>with</b> the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the Moon). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called frame-dragging. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.|$|E

40|$|Contact {{dermatitis}} is frequent skin pathology and eyelids {{are one of}} {{the more}} frequent locations of this pathology. The objective of the present work was to study the population distribution of periocular dermatitis, determine the allergens which most frequently indicate positive in patch tests and in provocative use tests, and analyse the clinical relevance of the positive <b>tests.</b> Patients <b>with</b> periocular dermatitis (N= 93) underwent a thorough physical examination and a patch <b>test</b> <b>with</b> standard series. According to clinical suspicions, 76 patients underwent a patch <b>test</b> <b>with</b> specific series. Finally a provocative use test was done for 36 patients with suspected products that the patients brought. The tests were classified according their relevance. The most frequently observed allergen in the patch <b>tests</b> (<b>with</b> standard and specific series) was nickel followed by mercury, and anti-glaucoma drops in the provocative use <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> patients products. Patients' sex, age, occupation, clinical status, presence of associated periocular symptoms, and presence of atopic or seborrheic dermatitis and/or rosacea did not relate with relevance. We conclude that a clinical diagnosis may not always be made <b>with</b> patch <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> standard and specific series due to lack of relevance. It is important to do provocative use <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> the products suspected as allergens in those cases where patch <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> standard and specific series indicated positive for more than one allergen...|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be <b>tested</b> <b>with</b> basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
