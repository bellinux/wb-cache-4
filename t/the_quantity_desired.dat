40|$|This {{paper will}} examine {{monetary}} policy appropriate {{for an open}} economy operating with a floating exchange rate. It will be shown {{that most of the}} conventional wisdom regarding each of the following issues is flawed: interest rate determination; ability of the central bank to “pump liquidity ” into an economy to fight deflation; central bank “monetization ” of budget deficits; central bank “sterilization”; the relation between the “twin deficits ” and their impacts on exchange rates. Briefly, the central bank sets the overnight interest rate target and then supplies or drains reserves to ensure banks have <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>desired</b> and/or required. The central bank can always “pump ” excess reserves into the system, but this will simply result in a zero-bid condition in the overnight market, causing overnight rates to fall to zero (or to the support rate if the central bank pays interest on reserves). The treasury spends by crediting bank accounts and taxes by debiting them—deficits simply mean that bank accounts have been net-credited, hence, reserves have increased. If this has created a position of excess reserves, the central bank or treasury must sell bonds or the overnight rate will fall. Hence, there is no operational meaning to be attached to the notion of central ban...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{bandwidth}} contracts over networks {{has recently been}} growing rapidly. Moreover, due to increased competition among providers, customized short-term bandwidth contracts are now preferred by users to static, long-term contracts of the past. To this end, auctions {{appear to be a}} proper trading mechanism. When purchasing bandwidth over a path of a network, it is only meaningful for a user to reserve the same quantity at all the constituent links. We have developed a simple, yet efficient auction for allocating bandwidth on a network basis to users who wish to utilize it for the same time period. This mechanism (referred to as MIDAS) consists of a set of simultaneous multi-unit Dutch (i. e. descending-price) auctions, one per link of the network. In order to win bandwidth over a certain path, it suffices for a user to simultaneously bid for <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>desired</b> at all relevant auctions. Thus, instant allocation of bandwidth is attained. An important feature of our approach is that prices at the various links are reduced at different rates, so that prices reflect the demand exhibited so far for each link. We have evaluated experimentally two price reduction policies, in terms of the social welfare associated with the resulting allocation, and argue (both theoretically and by means of experimental results) that it is indeed efficient to introduce such rules rather than reduce all prices at the same rate. We have also briefly addressed the issue of incentive compatible pricing...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three essays that analyze and {{study the effects of}} the present bias in the context of harvesting from a stock of renewable resources, showing this effect in the individual, collective and intergenerational frameworks. The first contribution shows and argues that the agent’s lifetime welfare is reduced by implementing a strategy dominated by the impulsivity inherent in the present bias. This result is showed assuming the existence of a dual system of discount in response to short- and long-term stimuli, where immediate rewards are processed by an impulsive system, while a reflective system is engaged in decisions about long-term rewards. The second essay shows that the behavior implemented by naïve agents, also if done with cooperative intent, can activate a dynamic of cascading defections from the cooperative strategy within the harvester group, where, the present biased preferences can trigger a strategy that directs the community to excessively increase the harvesting amounts despite the existence of cooperative intentions. The third contribution analyses the effects of the present bias in terms of reduction in the welfare of future generations, and shows that naïve behaviors conduct towards an amount of resources destined for the future generations, lesser than <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>desired</b> by the previous generation also in the presence of other-regarding preferences towards future generations. Furthermore, the third essay shows that if the social preferences of the individuals are not expressed exclusively by the spontaneous behavior of the agent, but are also expressed through a compliance with specific social norms charged with representing the individual's social preferences and designed to offer a commitment for the agent, a mitigation of the effect of present bias on the intergenerational equity can occur...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} examine policy {{appropriate}} {{for an open}} economy operating with a floating exchange rate—whether the economy in question is a large country that issues the currency used as the international reserve (the USA), or the economy is a smaller country that uses the international reserve currency (Mexico). What is important is that the country uses its own currency domestically (dollar or peso) {{and that it does}} not promise to convert its currency to international reserves (gold, another country’s currency) at a fixed exchange rate. Finally, it is recognized that exchange rates do not “freely ” float because “official ” intervention by governments is common, and many countries react when their currencies move outside a desired range. This is treated as discretionary policy (much as central banks also react to inflation) that does constrain domestic policy—however, as it is discretionary, the central bank can pursue alternative policy if it so chooses. We first examine how monetary policy operates in such a system, and then turn to implications for fiscal policy. It will be argued that a country that issues a sovereign currency in a floating rate regime can pursue full employment with price stability. Let us first summarize the argument. Briefly, the central bank sets the overnight interest rate target and then supplies or drains reserves to ensure banks have <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>desired</b> and/or required. The central bank can always “pump ” excess reserves into the system, but this will simply result in a zero-bid condition in the overnight market, causing overnight rates to fall to zero (or to the support rate if the central bank pays interest on reserves). There is something of an asymmetry: the central bank cannot leave banks short of reserves, as the overnight rate would rise conceivably without limit so we never observe central banks refusing to supply reserves; on the other hand, if the central bank leave...|$|E
40|$|The design {{requirements}} and initial design concept for the AXAF-I Science Instrument Module (SIM) were reviewed at Ball on September 29, 1993. The concept design SIM focus mechanism utilizes a planetary gearset, with redundant motors, {{to drive a}} large ring (called 'main housing bearing') via a spur gearset. This large drive ring actuates three tangent bar links (called 'push rods'), which in turn actuate three levers (called 'pin levers'). Each of the three pin levers rotates an 'eccentric pin,' which in turn moves {{the base of a}} bipod flexure in both the radial (normal to optical axis) and axial (focus along optical axis) directions. Three bipod flexures are employed, equally spaced at 120 degrees apart, the base of each being translated in the two directions as described above. A focus adjustment is made by rotating the drive ring, which drives the push rods and therefore the pin levers, which in turn rotate the eccentric pins, finally imparting the two motions to the base of each of the bipod flexures. The axial translation (focus adjustment) of the focused structure is the sum of the direct axial motion plus axial motion which comes from uniformly squeezing the three bipod bases radially inward. SAO documented the following concerns regarding the focus mechanism in memo WAP-FY 94 - 001, dated October 7, 1993 : (1) The focus adjustment depends, in large part, on the structural properties (stiffnesses and end fixities) of the bipod flexures, push rods, pin levers and eccentric pins. If these properties are not matched very well, then lateral translations as well as unwanted rotations of the focussed structure will accompany focus motion. In addition, the stackup of linkage tolerances and any nonuniform wear in the linkages will result in the same unwanted motions. Thermal gradients will also affect these motions. At the review Ball did not present supporting analyses to support their choice of this design concept. (2) The proposed 'primary' method of measuring focus is by counting motor steps. The 'backup' method is by a pot mounted on the drive ring. Neither method provides for a direct measurement of <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>desired</b> (focus position). This is of concern because of the long and indirect relationship between focus and the sensed quantity (drive ring rotation). There are three sinusoidal relationships and structural stiffness in the path, and the resulting calibration is likely to be highly nonlinear. These methods would require an accurate ground calibration. (3) Ground calibration (and verification) of focus vs. drive position must be done in 1 -g on the ground. This calibration will be complicated by both the structural characteristics of the bipods {{and the fact that the}} CG of the translating portion of the SIM is not on the optical axis (thereby causing unwated rotations and changing the focus position vs. motor step and pot readout relationships). The SIM translating weight could be offloaded, but the calibration then becomes sensitive to any errors in offloading (both magnitude and direction). There are concerns as to whether a calibration to the required accuracy can be accomplished on the ground. (4) The choice of a potentiometer as the focus position sensor is questionable in terms of reliability for a five year mission. The results of SAO's study of items 1, 2 and 3 described above are presented in this report...|$|E
