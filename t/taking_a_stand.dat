5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Germanophile mouthpieces, Seara stated {{its support for}} the Central Powers early on, before such financing could occur—even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported. In the months of strife which preceded the actual war, the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary {{about the effects of}} nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans. These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914, and urged Romanians to express their indignation. A month later, Seara was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against Romanian irredentism over Transylvania, as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici. Slavici's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile Mangra, the pro-Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence. However, the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student Măndăchescu. The latter, Seara reported, was wrongly accused of a bomb attack on the Diocese of Hajdúdorog, when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie Cătărău.|$|E

25|$|The Frankfurt School avoided <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> on {{the precise}} {{relationship}} between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers. Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of social evolution, while the materialist theory makes sense only {{as part of a}} quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory knowledge that is the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.|$|E
25|$|Until recent years, racial vilification of {{opposition}} players in VFL/AFL games was not uncommon. According to a 2001 study, Collingwoods old home ground of Victoria Park {{had a reputation}} as one of the worst venues for such vilification, though it has also been said that the problem was similar at all grounds. Collingwood has however been involved in several high-profile incidents of this type, such as those involving indigenous players Nicky Winmar in 1993 and Adam Goodes in 2013. Michael Longs accusation of racial vilification against Collingwood ruckman Damian Monkhorst in 1995 also led directly to the establishment of the AFL's racial vilification regulations. Collingwood club president Eddie McGuire has been credited for <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against racial vilification by club supporters and for harshly dealing with offenders.|$|E
25|$|Peace First, a {{non-profit}} organisation {{based in the}} United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum {{that can be used}} in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Hindman {{threw himself}} into the {{political}} and social scenes in his new home state. In June 1854, he formed a law partnership with John Palmer, a young Kentucky native who was known as a [...] "distinguished member" [...] of the Helena bar. Hindman became active in civic affairs and plans for Helena's economic development. At an Independence Day festival in 1854, he gave a speech about the importance of railroad development in Arkansas. Hindman catapulted himself into the fray by <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic Know-Nothings, whom he considered [...] "pestilent fanatics". Hindman and Palmer established a Democratic association designed to stamp out the Know-Nothing threat. During this time, Hindman became close friends with Patrick Cleburne, who would later parallel his course as a Confederate Major General. The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper, the Democratic Star, in December 1855.|$|E

500|$|During the Panic of 1857, Chemical Bank {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "Old Bullion" [...] by <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> {{that it would}} continue to redeem its bank notes in specie throughout the crisis. [...] The panic, which had hit banks and caused a number of failures, led banks {{across the country to}} suspend specie payments and turn to issuing paper promissory notes. [...] Chemical's decision was highly unpopular among its fellow banks and led to the bank's temporary suspension from the New York Clearing House, of which Chemical was a charter member. [...] While hundreds of banks closed, including 18 banks in New York in a single day, Chemical developed a reputation for stability. [...] This reputation proved extremely important in Chemical's growth during subsequent recessions during the 1860s. [...] Chemical frequently used the refrain [...] "Good as gold then, good as gold today" [...] in advertisements from the 1860s well into the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|By 1928, I. C. Filitti's {{writing was}} moving from sheer {{historical}} research, {{as he was}} <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> in political theory. As noted by Ioan Stanomir, Filitti's evolution in this direction marks a final cycle {{in the history of}} classical, [...] "Burkean", conservatism in Romania, which did not have a political aspect, but was complementary and contemporary with the views of his rival Nicolae Iorga. According to Stanomir, the objectivity professed by Filitti the historiographer was at odds with his ambition to rehabilitate Junimea and the Conservative cause, to prolong their relevancy into the 1930s. Some of his core ideas were updated versions of 19th-century Junimist concepts: the praise of moderation and organicity, the rejection of state capitalism and its [...] "pseudo-bourgeoisie", and in particular the critique of generous land reforms. Directly influenced by the agrarian skepticism of Carp and Maiorescu, Filitti argued that the division of large estates into non-lucrative plots had only enhanced endemic problems, such as poverty or an unskilled workforce, and had prevented an organic growth toward good governance. Filitti's diary chides the political establishment of Greater Romania for not obtaining sufficient guarantees of territorial integrity—particularly so against Russia's successor, the Soviet Union—and for deprofessionalizing the diplomatic corps.|$|E
500|$|In Australia, while Jardine's unfriendly {{approach}} and superior manner caused some friction {{with the press}} and spectators, the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload {{in preparation for the}} Test series. The first signs of trouble came in the match against a representative [...] "Australian XI" [...] at near full strength, in which the bowlers first used Bodyline tactics. Under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt (Jardine having rested from the match), the England attack bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed this was not pre-planned and he simply informed Jardine what had happened. The Bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players, including Jack Fingleton, were hit. The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were ethically wrong. However, at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated Bodyline but would not speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments {{at the start of the}} tour that cricket [...] "has become a synonym for all that is true and honest.

500|$|The Audiencia of Charcas {{took up the}} {{investigation}} of Reyes. [...] The Audencias, the judicial system of colonial Spain, had a wide degree of latitude and independence from the viceroy. [...] Charcas (now known as Sucre) was quite distant from the viceregal capital of Lima, amplifying the court's power even further. [...] In 1721, the audiencia sent judge José de Antequera y Castro to Asunción to dispense justice as he saw fit. [...] Antequera was a young rising star of the court, and even his fiercest critics wrote that he was likable, handsome, intelligent, and unusually well-educated for the time. [...] The Audiencia gave Antequera a sealed document to open if he found Reyes guilty. [...] The Audiencia and Antequera ordered Reyes to release the council members he had imprisoned and that he not interfere in {{the investigation}} in any way. [...] After interviewing the witnesses accusing Reyes of misdeeds, Antequera concluded that the evidence was so strong as to warrant the immediate arrest of Reyes in September 1721. [...] Antequera presented to the cabildo the sealed document he'd been given by the Audiencia. [...] The document gave Antequera the position of governor, which {{he took over the}} objections of Reyes' remaining supporters. [...] In April 1722, Antequera officially found Reyes guilty and dismissed him as governor, although Reyes immediately escaped Asunción on the same day the sentence was handed down. [...] Antequera proceeded to impound much of Reyes' property and also order the arrest of many of Reyes' friends and supporters, taking their property to be sold at public auction as well. [...] With all these actions, Antequera earned the support and adulation {{of the majority of the}} province, though he was hated by those who had done well under Reyes. [...] Antequera clinched his popularity by <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against the hated Jesuits; he endorsed settlers' demands that the mission Indians be distributed to the encomienda, that secular (paid by the Spanish government) priests be put in charge of the Jesuit missions, and that a customs house be established to enforce limits on Jesuit exports of yerba mate. [...] To historian James Saeger, Antequera comes across as mostly well-meaning; he sincerely believed imposing the civil authority upon the independent Jesuit missions would benefit the Empire.|$|E
