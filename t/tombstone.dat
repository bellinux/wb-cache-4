5|$|Holliday {{had saved}} Wyatt Earp's life {{at one time}} and had become a close friend. He {{had been living in}} Prescott, Arizona Territory and making a living as a gambler since late 1879. There, he first met future <b>Tombstone</b> sheriff Johnny Behan, a {{sometime}} gambler and saloon owner. In late September 1880, Holliday followed the Earps to <b>Tombstone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a famous}} {{graveyard}} in Balatonudvari where heart-shaped <b>tombstones</b> can be found. These <b>tombstones</b> {{are made of}} white marble.

Here you can find more than sixty <b>tombstones,</b> which are unique to Hungary. <b>Tombstones</b> like these can only be found in few places (for example in Balatonfüred's graveyard).|$|R

This myocardial infarction is associated with extensive myocardial damage, reduced left ventricle function, serious hospital complications and poor prognosis. <b>Tombstoning</b> ECG pattern is a notion beyond morphological difference and is associated with more serious clinical results. Despite the presence of a few reports on <b>tombstoning</b> ST elevation, there is no report which reviews STEMI demonstrating this electrocardiographic pattern.

5|$|James, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp {{arrived in}} <b>Tombstone</b> on December 1, 1879, when {{the small town}} was mostly {{composed}} of tents as living quarters, a few saloons and other buildings, and the mines. Virgil had been hired as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County, with his offices in <b>Tombstone,</b> only days before his arrival. In June 1881 he was also appointed as Tombstone's town marshal (or police chief).|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the <b>Tombstone</b> Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to <b>Tombstone.</b> They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the <b>Tombstone</b> Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, 1880, Wyatt was {{appointed}} deputy sheriff {{for the eastern}} part of Pima County, which included <b>Tombstone,</b> by Democratic County Sheriff Charlie Shibell. Wyatt passed on his Wells Fargo job as shotgun messenger to his brother Morgan. Wyatt did his job well, and from August through November, his name was mentioned nearly every week by The <b>Tombstone</b> Epitaph or the Nugget newspapers.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} Classical and Hellenistic figured <b>tombstones</b> from ancient Macedonia, mainly {{free-standing}} stelai and reliefs {{intended to be}} incorporated into larger architectural settings. Its aim {{is to provide a}} comprehensive study which looks at the <b>tombstones</b> both as part of the sculptural art and painting of Macedonia, as well as a strand of the sources available for the writing of ancient Macedonian social history. The geographical area and the chronological period under study are defined in the Introduction, where prior literature on the subject is also briefly overviewed. The material is then first looked at according to period, discussion focusing on chronological and stylistic groupings, {{as well as on the}} norms regarding selfrepresentation: pre-Classical <b>tombstones</b> eCho 2), <b>tombstones</b> of the 5 th C. BC eCho 3), <b>tombstones</b> of the 4 th C. BC eCho 4), <b>tombstones</b> of the 3 rd_l st C. Be eCho 5). The archaeological. context of the <b>tombstones</b> and the evidence provided by their inscriptions are discussed in Ch. 6.

5000|$|The {{history of}} the city dates back to 900 BC, the Urartu era. But the <b>tombstones</b> are from the medieval age. Although the <b>tombstones</b> are known as Seljukid era, {{according}} to the governorship of Ahlat the <b>tombstones</b> belong to {{the era of the}} Shah-Armens, Ayyubid dynasty era, the Mongol era and the Safavid era.

5|$|Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848– January 13, 1929) was an American Old West gambler, {{a deputy}} sheriff in Pima County, and deputy town marshal in <b>Tombstone,</b> Arizona Territory, {{who took part}} in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys. He is often mistakenly {{regarded}} as the central figure in the shootout in <b>Tombstone,</b> although his brother Virgil was <b>Tombstone</b> city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal that day, and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of <b>Tombstone,</b> {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of <b>Tombstone,</b> he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{decided to}} reject the offer of the young Kansan (who {{followed}} through with the plan and was later killed), and {{that he needed to}} leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to <b>Tombstone,</b> Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in <b>Tombstone</b> {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as <b>Tombstone</b> was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E

5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her <b>tombstone</b> was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara Coeli during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her <b>tombstone</b> today.|$|E

5|$|The second {{main event}} match had Bearer's Undertaker {{fighting}} DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker {{walked to the}} ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He reached inside the casket and pulled out an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a <b>Tombstone</b> piledriver. As he tried for another <b>Tombstone</b> piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more <b>Tombstone</b> piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away.|$|E
