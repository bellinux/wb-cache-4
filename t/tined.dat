[...] "Archibald, {{the third}} Earl of Douglas, was so unfortunate {{in all his}} enterprises, that he {{acquired}} the epithet of 'tine-man,' because he <b>tined,</b> or lost, his followers in every battle which he fought. He was vanquished, as every reader must remember, in the bloody battle of Homildon-hill, near Wooler, where he himself lost an eye, and was made prisoner by Hotspur. He was no less unfortunate when allied with Percy, being wounded and taken {{at the battle of}} Shrewsbury. He was so unsuccessful in an attempt to beseige Roxburgh Castle, that it was called the 'Foul Raid,' or disgraceful expedition. His ill fortune left him indeed at the battle of Beauge, in France; but it was only to return with double emphasis at the subsequent action of Vernoil, the last and most unlucky of his encounters, in which he fell, with the flower of the Scottish chivalry, then serving as auxiliaries in France, and about two thousand common soldiers, A.D. 1424" [...] (Scott).|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{experimentally}} study how the vibrational acceleration spreads along the branch shaken by PVC <b>tine,</b> steel <b>tine,</b> and nylon <b>tine</b> for citrus canopy shaking harvesting and to compare the difference. PVC <b>tine</b> and steel <b>tine</b> have potential to be used as shaking rod for citrus canopy shaking harvesting. Nylon <b>tine</b> is a commonly used shaking rod. A tractor-mounted canopy shaker was developed to do the trial. The shaking frequency was set at 2. 5 and 5 [*]Hz. Experimental results showed that the vibrational acceleration at the shaking spot is not the highest. Spreading from shaking spot to the stem, it increases evidently. When spreading from stems of the outside subbranch to stems of the nearest inside subbranch, its average decrease percentage is 42 %. The overall vibrational acceleration of shaking at 5 [*]Hz is 1. 85 times as high as shaking at 2. 5 [*]Hz. The overall vibrational acceleration exerted by straight PVC <b>tine</b> and steel <b>tine</b> is 1. 77 and 1. 97 times as high as that exerted by straight nylon <b>tine,</b> respectively. It is indicated that replacing nylon <b>tine</b> with steel <b>tine</b> or PVC <b>tine</b> helps remove the fruits inside the canopy.

40|$|Weeds in row crops {{compete for}} {{resources}} available to crop plants and thus will affect crop yield and quality. However, consumers show a growing interest in organic food or foods produced with fewer agricultural chemicals. Therefore, a need exists to develop alternative weed control methods. A <b>tine</b> mechanism for an autonomous weeding machine was developed, and the interaction of a single <b>tine</b> and a rotating <b>tine</b> mechanism with the soil was investigated. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a laboratory methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a <b>tine</b> and rotating <b>tine</b> mechanism in disturbing weed plants simulated by individual wood pieces. Two experiments were performed using the <b>tine</b> and <b>tine</b> mechanism under a controlled environment. Soil in a large rotating bin was processed and sieved to a maximum size of 5 mm. The soil was then conditioned with water to produce the desired moisture content. A single <b>tine</b> was used in the first experiment. The experimental factors for this test were the <b>tine</b> diameter, <b>tine</b> depth and the speed that the <b>tine</b> moved through the soil. For the second experiment, four <b>tines</b> were attached to a disk that rotated about a vertical axis. The rotational <b>tine</b> mechanism was tested at different working depths and disk rotational speeds. All of these tests were conducted in a rotating soil bin with a controlled speed. The orientation of each simulated weed was observed in each trial. The observations were captured in a Mean Likelihood of Control (MLC) parameter which was intended to indicate the mean likelihood of simulated weed being controlled. In the first experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across <b>tine</b> diameter, <b>tine</b> working depth and travel speed. There was evidence of a significant interaction between <b>tine</b> diameter and <b>tine</b> working depth. As for the second experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across <b>tine</b> working depth and rotational speed of <b>tine</b> mechanism. Evidence of a significant interaction between working depth and <b>tine</b> mechanism rotational speed was observed.

40|$|AbstractRepeated {{trafficking}} and harvesting operations lead {{to high levels}} of compaction in inter-row wheelings used in asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) production. This reduces soil porosity and infiltration resulting in water ponding on the soil surface. Even on gently sloping land this can result in runoff generation and an increased risk of soil erosion. A winged <b>tine</b> (WT) is currently used by a leading asparagus grower to loosen compacted inter-row wheelings. In order to test the effectiveness of this <b>tine</b> for alleviating compaction and implications for runoff and soil erosion control, it was evaluated alongside several other <b>tine</b> configurations. These were a narrow <b>tine</b> (NT); a narrow <b>tine</b> with two shallow leading <b>tines</b> (NSLT); a winged <b>tine</b> with two shallow leading <b>tines</b> (WSLT); and a modified para-plough (MPP). Testing was conducted under controlled conditions on a sandy loam soil in the Soil Management Facility at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, UK. <b>Tine</b> performance was assessed at 3 depths (175, 250 and 300 mm) by draught force; soil disturbance (both above and below ground); specific draught for a given level of soil disturbance; surface roughness; and estimated change in soil bulk density. The effectiveness of <b>tines</b> for compaction alleviation and potential for mitigating runoff and soil erosion varied with depth.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether prolonged sacral neuromodulation (SNM) testing induces a substantial {{risk of infection}} because of the percutaneous passage of the extension wire. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients with negative prolonged SNM testing for >or= 14 days who underwent tined-lead explantation were prospectively evaluated. The explanted <b>tined</b> leads were sent for microbiological examination. The <b>tined</b> lead, gluteal, and extension wire incision sites were investigated for clinical signs of infection according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification system. RESULTS: In all, 17 patients had bilateral and three unilateral implanted <b>tined</b> leads. The median (range) test period was 30 (21 - 62 days). Bacterial growth (Staphylococcus species) was detected in four of 20 (20 %) patients on seven of 37 (19 %) explanted <b>tined</b> leads. There were clinical signs of infection in one of 20 (5 %) patients at none of 37 <b>tined</b> lead, one of 20 (5 %) gluteal, and none of 20 extension wire incision sites. There were no clinical signs of infection in the remaining three of four patients with bacterial growth. CONCLUSIONS: After prolonged tined-lead testing, we found an infection rate comparable to that reported with the usual short test period. In addition, most patients with bacterial growth on <b>tined</b> leads showed no clinical signs of infection. Thus, prolonged tined-lead testing {{does not seem to}} induce clinically relevant infection, warranting randomized trials...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Prolonged sacral {{neuromodulation}} (SNM) {{testing is}} more reliable for accurate patient selection {{than the usual}} test period of 4 - 7 days. However, prolonged testing was suspected {{to result in a}} higher complication rate due to infection via the percutaneous passage of the extension wire. Therefore, we prospectively assessed the complications associated with prolonged <b>tined</b> lead testing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 44 patients who underwent prolonged <b>tined</b> lead testing for at least 14 days between May 2002 and April 2007 were evaluated. Complications during prolonged <b>tined</b> lead testing, during and after <b>tined</b> lead explantation and during follow-up after implantation of the implantable pulse generator (IPG) were registered prospectively. RESULTS: Four patients suffered from urgency-frequency syndrome, 13 from urge incontinence, 18 from non-obstructive chronic urinary retention and nine from chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The median test phase was 30 days (interquartile range [IQR] 21 - 36). Thirty-two of the 44 patients (73 %) had successful prolonged <b>tined</b> lead testing and 31 of these (97 %) underwent the implantation of the IPG. The median follow-up of the IPG implanted patients was 31 months (IQR 20 - 41). The complication rate was 5 % (2 / 44) during prolonged <b>tined</b> lead testing and 16 % (5 / 31) during follow-up of the IPG implanted patients, respectively. None of the complications could be attributed to prolonged testing. No infections were observed during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, observational non-randomised study suggests prolonged SNM <b>tined</b> lead testing is a safe procedure. Based on the low complication rate and the increased reliability for accurate patient selection, this method is proposed as a possible standard test procedure, subject to confirmation by further randomised, controlled clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Five new {{profilers}} {{were tested}} for repeatability on four concrete test sections with diverse smoothness and texture: (1) a very smooth diamond ground section, (2) a moderately rough transversely <b>tined</b> section, (3) a smooth longitudinally <b>tined</b> section, and (4) a smooth section with a drag texture. Each profiler measured 4 to 6 profiles on each section. Repeatability was quantified through objective comparison of profiles, using only those features {{that contribute to}} the IRI. Ames Engineering’s lightweight profiler with a RoLine height sensor demonstrated good or excellent repeatability on all four test sections. Ames Engineering’s lightweight and high speed profilers, both using the TriODS laser system, demonstrated good repeatability on the longitudinally <b>tined</b> section and excellent repeatability on the transversely <b>tined</b> and drag texture sections. Dynatest’s Mark IV high-speed profiler demonstrated excellent repeatability on the transversely <b>tined</b> section and good repeatability on the drag texture. Table 1 lists the profilers that qualified as having good and excellent repeatability on each section, where good is considered 90 % or better, and excellent is considered 95 % or better. The two Ames Engineering lightweight profilers were operated with an on-board apparatus that helped the driver maintain an accurate and consistent lateral position during the tests. The repeatability ratings cited herein pertain only to the use of these devices with this apparatus. These tests showed that repeatability of profile measurement on longitudinally <b>tined</b> pavement and diamond ground pavement depends heavily on the use of a large laser sensor footprint and consistent lateral tracking of the profiler.

After optimal lead position was obtained fluoroscopically in the right ventricular apex or right atrium, the pacing threshold and R- or P-wave amplitudes were measured at 5 -minute intervals for 30 minutes. The acute ventricular pacing threshold with the screw-in lead {{was significantly higher than}} with the <b>tined</b> lead (0. 84 +/- 0. 17 vs 0. 58 +/- 0. 15 volts; p < 0. 001). There was a significant (p < 0. 001) acute decrease in the ventricular pacing threshold with both lead types, with the maximum decrease occurring 5 minutes after lead implantation. There was a significant acute increase in R-wave size with the ventricular screw-in lead that peaked 20 minutes after lead implantation (11. 9 +/- 3. 0 to 14. 7 +/- 4. 1 mV; p < 0. 001). The atrial screw-in lead behaved in a manner identical to its counterpart in the ventricle. In conclusion, there are acute changes in the pacing threshold and R- or P-wave amplitude obtained with <b>tined</b> and screw-in pacing leads. In some patients, a pacing threshold or R- or P-wave amplitude that is initially unacceptable may improve to an acceptable level over 15 to 20 minutes without further lead manipulation, especially when an atrial screw-in lead is used...|$|E
