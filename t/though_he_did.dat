5000|$|In March 1843 Heinrich Heine {{wrote about}} Thalberg: His {{performance}} is so gentlemanly, so entirely without any forced acting the genius, so entirely without that well-known brashness {{that makes a}} poor cover for inner insecurity. Healthy women love him. So do sickly women, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not engage their sympathy by epileptic seizures at the piano, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not play at their overstrung, delicate nerves, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> neither electrifies them nor galvanizes them.|$|R

5|$|Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a {{match against}} the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not {{defeated}} since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10in 2001.

Collingwood's difficulties with the bat seemed to affect his usually high-class catching, and he dropped three chances of varying degrees of difficulty on the final day of the series at the Oval, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> take a sharp catch to dismiss Mitchell Johnson for a duck off Steve Harmison as part of England's surge to a 197-run victory in the match, and a 2–1 victory in the series.|$|E
