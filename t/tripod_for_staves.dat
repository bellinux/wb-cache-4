50|$|The Glynn County Police Department uses a {{wireless}} mesh-networked system of portable battery-powered <b>tripods</b> <b>for</b> live megapixel video surveillance and central monitoring of tactical police situations.

50|$|The {{machine gun}} {{could be used}} as a LMG with a bipod or as a medium machine gun with a tripod. When used with a <b>tripod</b> <b>for</b> {{continuous}} fire, the gun was fitted with a heavier barrel. In the LMG configuration, the machine gun was a relatively light weapon to carry. The lower receiver of the weapon came from an RPD with a modified stock.|$|R

50|$|The K3 is a {{light machine}} gun {{resembling}} the FN Minimi and uses a standard 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. Its greatest advantage {{is that it is}} lighter than the M60 and can interchange cartridges with both the K1A and K2. The feed can come from either a 30-round box magazine or a 200-round metal link belt. It can be used with a bipod for the Squad Automatic role, and fitted with a <b>tripod</b> <b>for</b> sustained fire support.|$|R
50|$|Just after Windfall founder James B. Fouch {{built the}} first sawmill in 1853, Josiah Ross {{built the first}} home in the town, which he used as a general store. Multiple storehouses were built by 1859, buying and selling products, {{including}} grain, to business via the railroad. A factory <b>for</b> <b>stave</b> manufacturing was built in 1865. In 1873, the Windfall Steam Flouring Mill was founded. A felloe factory was built in 1877 by Thornburgh and Hirons.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the risk}} of camera movement, the camera is most often mounted on a <b>tripod</b> <b>for</b> the {{duration}} of the exposure. While it's generally possible to use the shutter release button on the camera itself, a cable release or electronic remote is often used to further eliminate the risk of shaking the camera during the long exposure. The cable releases generally include a locking feature to eliminate the need to keep the button or plunger depressed during extremely long exposures.|$|R

50|$|The M205 Lightweight <b>Tripod</b> <b>for</b> Heavy Machine Guns is the {{replacement}} for the current M3 tripod {{in support of the}} M2 machine gun and Mk 19 grenade launcher used in the United States armed forces. The soldier will experience less weight burden with the M205 Lightweight Tripod than with the standard M3 Tripod (50.3 lb, including the pintle and T&E), and {{will be able to take}} advantage of the enhanced tripod’s integrated traverse and elevation mechanism for quicker, more accurate target engagement.|$|R
50|$|The 8 cm minomet vz. 36 {{was a close}} copy of the French Brandt {{series of}} mortars. While it {{differed}} in details {{the most important thing}} was that its ammunition was incompatible with the Brandt mortars. It fired two different mortar bombs, a light 3.265 kg bomb to a range of 3400 m and a heavy 6.85 kg bomb to 1200 m. It broke down into three loads, barrel, baseplate and <b>tripod,</b> <b>for</b> transport. Normally one man carried each piece.|$|R
5000|$|The gun was {{originally}} chambered in 6mm Lee Navy and later, after {{the adoption of}} the Krag-Jørgensen rifle, in [...]30-40 Krag, 7×57mm Mauser caliber (the same cartridge used in the Spanish Model 1893 Mauser), and [...]30-06 Springfield in 1914. The 1914 version also included a lower <b>tripod</b> <b>for</b> firing prone; this is likely what led to the gun's nickname of [...] "potato digger", as the operating lever would dig into the ground if it were fired from too low a position.|$|R
6000|$|This whole {{narrative}} {{is probably a}} relic of the old diplomatic 'lingua-arcana,' or state-symbolique--in which the prediction of events is expressed as the immediate causing of them.

5000|$|The irony {{was that}} McNaughton's scheme <b>for</b> <b>staving</b> off {{revolution}} had {{the seeds of}} revolution inherent in it.

50|$|In the XVI—XIX centuries {{the best}} {{furniture}} {{was made of}} Ceylon ebony. The wood was preferred for making door and window handles, table-ware shanks, while the cutting was used for knitting needles and hooks or razor handles making. Today the wood is perfectly used in handmade artwork and for producing some parts of musical instruments (for example, grand piano keys, necks, string holders and <b>tripods</b> <b>for</b> instruments), turnery (including chess pieces), knife hafts, brush holders and chopsticks. Also {{it is good for}} mosaic wooden inlay.|$|R
5000|$|Rockets were {{introduced}} to western warfare during the Napoleonic Wars; the Congreve rocket was a British weapon devised by Sir William Congreve in 1804 after experiencing Indian rockets at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799). Congreve rockets were launched from an iron trough about 18 inches (45 centimetres) in length, called a [...] "chamber". These chambers could be fixed to the ground for horizontal launching, secured to a folding copper <b>tripod</b> <b>for</b> high angle fire or mounted on frames on carts or the decks of warships.|$|R
25|$|Bedi is {{reported}} to have filmed several rare wildlife moments such as the first recording of the reproduction of gharials, nursing, multiple mating and leopard hunting of tigers and breeding of bar-headed geese. He has filmed Tibetan and Indian wild dogs (dholes), Himalayan lynx and snow leopard for the first time. He is also known to have made innovative accessories like a 10 feet <b>tripod</b> <b>for</b> filming predatory animals. Criticisms have also surfaced with Bedi being accused of shooting a captive tiger for a scene showing the animal in water.|$|R
