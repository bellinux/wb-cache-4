25|$|Four creases (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return creases) {{are drawn}} {{at each end}} of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps.

The bowling creases lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) away, and marks the other end of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a no ball because a fielder has encroached on the pitch or the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a no ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that part of the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride must fall behind the popping crease (see below).|$|E

The popping crease must be [...] in front of and parallel to the bowling crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length, the popping crease must be marked to at least [...] on either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the middle stumps. The return creases, which are the lines a bowler must be within when making a delivery, are drawn on each side of each set of the stumps, along each sides of the pitch (so there are four return creases in all, one on either side of both sets of stumps). The return creases lie perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease, [...] either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps.

40|$|International audienceCreasing is {{a process}} which indents a section of {{corrugated}} board along fold lines to facilitate a neat fold. Most common failure site in a box made out of corrugated board is at the folds, where the stiffness is reduced by <b>the</b> <b>creasing</b> operation. Crease depth is an important parameter to be controlled. If <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> is too shallow, the section will crack during folding due to excessive strain on the outer liner. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> is too deep, the board may crack during <b>the</b> <b>creasing</b> operation itself or it may fail during handling due to excessive reduction in local strength along the fold line. A {{review of the literature}} reveals that only a limited amount of research has been carried out on experimental creasing of corrugated boards and comparison with numerical analyses.
