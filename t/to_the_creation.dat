5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E
5|$|Appleâ€™s first tablet {{computer}} was the Newton MessagePad 100, introduced in 1993, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of the ARM6 processor core with Acorn Computers.

Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the MessagePad 2100, was discontinued in 1998.|$|E

5|$|By 1661, Copenhagen had {{asserted}} {{its position}} as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, {{as was the}} fleet {{and most of the}} army.

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E

5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E
