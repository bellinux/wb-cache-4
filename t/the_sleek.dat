The image is often invoked retrofuturistically to produce a nostalgic feel in period works, especially in comic science fiction; both Mars Attacks! and Destroy All Humans! draw on the flying saucer as part of the larger satire of 1950s B movie tropes.|$|E

This resulted in a proposal to instead operate the long-distance trains between Trondheim and Oslo on the Røros Line via Solør instead of via Hamar. <b>The</b> <b>sleek</b> curvature would allow for high speeds, and the congestion of the Dovre Line could be cut. After considerable political discussion, Hedmark County Council approved a new bus service between Kongsvinger and Elverum and onwards to Hamar. Local train services were thereby terminated from 1 June 1986, the same day a daily day train and a daily night trains to run.|$|E

500|$|Monotype {{had already}} {{designed}} two other types {{inspired by the}} same period of Italian printing and calligraphy, the roman Poliphilus and italic Blado (both 1923). Made more eccentric and irregular than <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> lines of Bembo to evoke the feel of antique printing, these remained in Monotype's catalogue and have been digitised, but are much less known today. Bembo can therefore be seen as an iteration of a preexisting design concept towards mass market appeal, taking the basic idea of the Griffo design and (unlike Poliphilus) updating its appearance to match the more sophisticated printing possible by the 1920s. Bembo's original working name was [...] "Poliphilus Modernised".|$|E

500|$|Bungie {{designed}} {{the majority of}} Covenant technology to mirror the aesthetic of the Elites; the exteriors are sleek and graceful, with a more angular and complex core underneath hinting at the fictional Forerunner origins of the technology. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> Elite-based designs of the Covenant at large, the Brutes were given their own visual design distinct from the other Covenant. Weaponry was designed to reflect the Brute's [...] "souls" [...] distilled to its purest form—conveyed by dangerous shapes, harsh colors, and objects that looked [...] "dangerous to be around". A UNSC weapon designed for Combat Evolved in 1999 that was discarded {{at the time was}} re-purposed as the Brute's [...] "Mauler" [...] weapon.|$|E
500|$|Sam Richards of NME {{described}} A Moon Shaped Pool as [...] "an {{album of}} eerie, elusive beauty that is strange, shimmering and uncertain {{all at the}} same time." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for AllMusic that [...] "there's a melancholic comfort to its ebb and flow, a gentle rocking motion that feels comforting; it's a tonic to the cloistered, scattered King of Limbs and even <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> alienation of Kid A." [...] Pitchfork editor Jayson Greene felt the album was coloured by Yorke's separation: [...] "The impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy." [...] At the end of the year, Pitchfork named [...] "Daydreaming" [...] and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the 24th and 9th best songs of 2016 respectively.|$|E
500|$|Stardust {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most publications, both on its original release {{and for its}} various reissues. Rolling Stone praised the album: [...] "For all <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> sophistication of the material, Stardust is as down-home as the Legion dance. Heard coast to coast in lounges and on elevator soundtracks, these tunes {{have become part of}} the folk music of exurban America. And that's the way Nelson plays them—spare and simple, with a jump band's verve and a storyteller's love of a good tale. By offering these songs, he's displaying the tools of a journeyman musician's trade—worn smooth and polished by constant use—and when he lays them out this way, they kind of look like works of art. Willie Nelson may be acknowledging both his own and country music's debt to Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, but he's also showing these hallowed musical institutions how the country makes their music its own".|$|E

500|$|Production {{designer}} Scott Chambliss {{maintained the}} layout of the original bridge, but aesthetically altered it with brighter colors to reflect the optimism of Star Trek. The viewscreen was made into a window that could have images projected on it to make the space environment palpable. Abrams compared the redesign to <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> modernist work of Pierre Cardin and the sets from , which were from the 1960s. He joked the redesigned bridge made the Apple Store look [...] "uncool". At the director's behest, more railings were added to the bridge to make it look safer, and the set was built on gimbals so its rocking motions when the ship accelerates and is attacked was more realistic. To emphasize the size of the ship, Abrams chose to give the engine room a highly industrial appearance: he explained to Pegg that he was inspired by , a sleek ship in which there was an [...] "incredible gut".|$|E
500|$|Stanton noted many {{commentators}} placed {{emphasis on}} the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because [...] "that disconnection {{is going to be}} the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature, making them [...] "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. [...] "WALL-E is not a Luddite film," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature—that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along." ...|$|E

Darryl Sterdan of Jam! was surprised by the new musical direction of Beyoncé but concluded that [...] "... you better believe it ... it kinda works". Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix described [...] "Radio" [...] as the most believable song on the album, and complimented its [...] "amid bland testaments to love's timeless endurance and the smut and thuggin of the 'Sasha Fierce' persona, [...] is one with sensual overtones sung to an electronic device that, unlike men, 'never lets me down'". Echoing Brockman's sentiments, Amy Linden of Vibe magazine, who wrote that 1980's electropop and <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> Valentine music of [...] "Radio" [...] tells the story of Beyoncé's alter ego. Similarly, Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] "show [...] Sasha [...] just a good girl playing fierce". By contrast, Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V.

50|$|In/Casino/Out (stylized as in/CASINO/out) is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by American post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, released on August 18, 1998 through Fearless Records. It was recorded as a live studio album, {{with the intention of}} better capturing the energy and sound of their live shows.

500|$|Stanton {{wanted the}} Axioms {{interior}} to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings {{and the original}} concept art for Tomorrowland for the Axiom, to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked [...] "We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [...] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland," [...] and wanted a [...] "jet pack" [...] feel. Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his Axiom designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided {{the inside of the}} ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has [...] "S" [...] shapes as people are always looking for [...] "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial Axiom, camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam.|$|E
500|$|This new version, {{unveiled}} in early 1997, still used the Warcraft II engine as its base, but with distinct changes. The Terrans and the Protoss were detailed {{to a much}} greater extent than at E3 1996, revealing many of the game's units in forms {{similar to those of}} the final product. Blizzard Entertainment also began the careful task of balancing the game's three races. However, in February 1997, Bob Fitch declared that, despite these efforts, the game engine was simply incapable of delivering features requested by the developers: cloaking, burrowing and many other special effects. The development team therefore embarked upon a two-month overhaul of the graphics engine. This new beta version was far closer to the release version, as the races took on their now-recognisable graphical styles: the brown insectoid design of the Zerg, <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> yellow armour of the Protoss, and the grey machinery of the Terrans. Most of the unit designs were established at this point, their graphics only undergoing minor changes. Several game features were also added at this stage in the development that never made it into the final release, such as ships banking as they turned, transport ships landing on the ground to pick up and drop off passengers, and efficiency ranks, although Terran units would retain ranks as a purely aesthestic feature. The Terran Valkyrie-class missile frigate also appeared in this build of the game, although it was removed before the final release, only to be reintroduced later in the [...] expansion.|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has <b>the</b> <b>sleek</b> aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E
