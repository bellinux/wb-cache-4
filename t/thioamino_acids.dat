40|$|Thioglycine and l-thiovaline are stable under acidic {{and basic}} {{conditions}} {{but in the}} presence of bicarbonate they liberate the gasotransmitter H(2) S. In cells both <b>thioamino</b> <b>acids</b> were proven to enhance cGMP formation and promote vasorelaxation in mouse aortic rings. Given that H(2) S is known to lower arterial hypertension, reduce oxidative stress and exhibit cardioprotective effects in preclinical models, H(2) S donors hold promise as novel treatments for cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|Redox equilibria are {{important}} in biology. They determine, for example, the physiological fate of both iron and copper. Given that the redox potential of blood plasma may be as low as - 200 mV and that the potential in cells {{is likely to be}} considerably lower, the dominant low-molecular-mass species of copper and iron in biological fluids might be Cu(I) and Fe(II) rather than the commonly-assumed Cu(II) and Fe(III). However, this has proved difficult hitherto to investigate due to the absence of reliable formation constants of Cu(I) with complexing agents of likely biological significance and the uncertainty in the previously reported biologically important formation constants of Fe(III) and Fe(II) with citrate. In this work, the formation constants of Fe(III) and Fe(II) with citrate and the complexation of Cu(I) with the <b>thioamino</b> <b>acids,</b> cysteine, glutathione and penicillamine, have been studied by potentiometric titration using specially developed techniques. The formation of mixed complexes of Cu(I) with <b>thioamino</b> <b>acids</b> was investigated for the first time. These formation constants were used in a computer simulation of copper and iron speciation in blood plasma. In contrast to all previous blood plasma models, the redox relationships were taken into account. The resulting models, incorporating about 7200 chemical species, show that Cu(I) and Fe(II) species are indeed likely to predominate in the low-molecular-mass fraction of blood plasma. In this way, cysteine is suggested {{to be the most important}} naturally occurring low-molecular-mass ligand for copper. The blood plasma models were also used to investigate the role of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease, a condition of copper toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Protonation {{constants}} for the biologically-important <b>thioamino</b> <b>acids</b> cysteine (CSH), penicillamine (PSH) and glutathione (GSH), and {{the formation}} constants of their complexes with Cu(i), have been measured at 25 °C and an ionic strength of 1. 00 mol dm- 3 (Na) Cl using glass electrode potentiometry. The first successful characterisation of binary Cu(i) -CSH and Cu(i) -GSH species over the whole pH range was achieved in this study {{by the addition of}} a second thioamino acid, which prevented the precipitation that normally occurs. Appropriate combinations of binary and ternary (mixed ligand) titration data were used to optimise the speciation models and formation constants for the binary species. The results obtained differ significantly from literature data with respect to the detection and quantification of protonated and polynuclear complexes. The present results are thought to be more reliable because of the exceptionally wide pH and concentration ranges employed, the excellent reproducibility of the data, the close agreement between the calculated and observed formation functions, and the low standard deviations and absence of numerical correlation in the constants. The present formation constants were incorporated into a large Cu speciation model which was used to predict, for the first time, metal-ligand equilibria in the biofluids of the human eye. This simulation provided an explanation for the precipitation of metallic copper in lens and cornea, which is known to occur as a consequence of Wilson's disease...|$|E
