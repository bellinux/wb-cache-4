2500|$|The Sunset Cafe {{closed in}} 1927. Hines, Armstrong and the drummer Zutty Singleton {{agreed that they}} would become the [...] "Unholy Three" [...] – they would [...] "stick {{together}} and not play for anyone unless the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> hired". But as Louis Armstrong and His Stompers (with Hines as musical director and the premises rented in Hines's name), they ran into difficulties trying to establish their own venue, the Warwick Hall Club. Hines went briefly to New York and returned to find that Armstrong and Singleton had rejoined the rival Dickerson band at the new Savoy Ballroom in his absence, leaving Hines feeling [...] "warm". When Armstrong and Singleton later asked him to join them with Dickerson at the Savoy Ballroom, Hines said, [...] "No, you guys left me {{in the rain and}} broke the little corporation we had".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Foo Fighters {{traveled}} to Grohl's {{home state of}} Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, [...] "in those few weeks {{it just seemed like}} the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> moving in one direction and Franz wasn't". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's Virginia home studio that he bought and built. The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Learn to Fly", the band's first single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100. Other singles included [...] "Stacked Actors", [...] "Generator", [...] "Next Year" [...] and [...] "Breakout".|$|E
60|$|The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> closeted for fully an hour. What {{took place}} will be told hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|Franks {{came toward}} them. [...] "Here's the program. The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> going up first, alone. The {{soldiers}} will follow in fifteen minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. My uncle, Foster Portney, {{has sent}} for Randy {{and me to}} come to San Francisco, and the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> going to some new gold fields." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet we live, Miriam, and I {{believe that}} for none <b>of</b> the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> the end at hand. Well, {{you will not}} fly, either with me or without me?" ...|$|R
60|$|When the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> in {{position}} Simon Kenton gave the signal, and we prodded vigorously with the poles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. Some strict institution, {{you can be}} sure of that. Uncle Randolph told aunty it {{was time}} the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> taken in hand. He said Dick wasn't so bad, but you and I--" ...|$|E
60|$|All <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> {{inspired}} with {{an intense}} desire to possess {{one of these}} quaint watches, the moment we saw one hanging {{at the side of}} a certain lovely woman at a party where it created a great sensation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess not," [...] {{said the}} man who had spoken already. [...] "Still, if there's any shooting, two or <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> going to smell trouble as well as Tomlinson." ...|$|R
60|$|We had a ball {{last night}} under the awnings {{of the quarter}} deck, and the share <b>of</b> it <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> masquerade. We had full, flowing, picturesque Moorish costumes which we {{purchased}} in the bazaars of Tangier.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a long story," [...] I {{answered}} cheerfully. [...] "May we come in? We {{will take}} the risks, we are accustomed to them and {{hope to be able}} to do you a service. I should explain that <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> white men, two English and one--American." ...|$|R
60|$|Simultaneously the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> smitten by an {{uplifting}} thought. Surely {{this test}} would eliminate Vesey from the contest. He, with his unctuous flattery, would be driven from the lists. Well we remembered Ileen's love of frankness and honesty--how she treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment.|$|E
60|$|The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> peering intently in that direction, {{when the}} Reindeer struck {{with a dull}} crash {{and came to a}} standstill. We ran forward, and found her {{bowsprit}} entangled in the tanned rigging of a short, chunky mast. She had collided, head on, with a Chinese junk lying at anchor.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have been}} cast away {{on an island}} some twelve hundred miles to the west. Only <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> saved. We built this craft between us. One of my comrades is dead, the other remains on the island, and I have sailed her back single-handed. I think this, sir, will account for my {{somewhat}} strange appearance.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... he <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> (Bush, Kerry, & Schieffer) share something. All <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> {{surrounded}} by very strong women. We're all married to strong women. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have two daughters {{that make us}} very proud. I'd like to ask each of you, {{what is the most}} important thing you've learned from these women? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{strive to}} learn {{somewhat}} of the situation, because just now a grain, {{or two more}} of knowledge may save our lives. To-night, if not before, and in case the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> allowed to remain at liberty, I will try to have speech with you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} would not; but never mind, and let me go on. The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> concerned, at any rate; you, and he, and I. I am {{thinking}} of him now. We have all suffered, but I do believe that hitherto he has had the worst of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One evening, as two or <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> mooning {{about the}} stairs, praying {{secretly}} {{for a war}} or a famine, Todhunter, the town reporter, rushed past us with a cheer, and burst into the Sub-editor's room. We followed. He was waving his notebook above his head, and clamouring, after the manner of people in French exercises, for pens, ink, and paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Klaus Epstein." [...] The other soldier {{shook with}} him, a small dark man with {{thinning}} hair. Epstein plucked nervously at his ear. [...] "Austrian. Impressed God knows when. I don't remember. The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> here, Rudi and I, with Tasso." [...] He indicated the woman. [...] "That's how we escaped. All {{the rest were}} down in the bunker." ...|$|E
60|$|Glad enough were we {{to reach}} it, since all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> tired out with our terrible night journey and the anxious {{emotions}} {{that we had}} undergone. Indeed, after we had eaten we lay down and I rejoiced to see that, notwithstanding the state of mental excitement into which the discovery of his wife had plunged him, Ragnall {{was the first of}} us to fall asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seeing {{that all}} <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> still in health, {{as if there}} is {{anything}} in the promises of Murgh we should remain, is it not time, master," [...] asked Grey Dick, [...] "that we left this accursed Venice? Now that Sir Geoffrey is gone, there is naught to keep us here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ray Manzarek {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "We're all getting older. We should, the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>be</b> playing these songs because, hey, the end is always near. Morrison was a poet, and above all, a poet wants his words heard." [...] When Morrison was asked what he would most like to be remembered for, he responded, [...] "My words, man, my words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Next spring,' said Helen; 'we shall all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>be</b> {{confirmed}} at {{the same}} time. But if Mrs. Hazleby had not been here, Papa would have heard us all down-stairs. I should have liked for you to hear how perfect Edward is now, and how well Dora answers Papa's questions; though perhaps before you she would be too shy.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{could hardly}} have moved more quickly if each had been {{provided}} with wings. In a twinkling the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> off, every lad headed toward his own home, and for my part, I know that {{it seemed as if}} I hardly gave myself time to breathe, so eager was I to return to the rendezvous in the shortest possible space of time.|$|E
60|$|We were immensely excited. All the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> {{so far in}} {{love with}} Ellen Fordyce that her {{presence}} was an enchantment to us, and at any rate none of us ever saw the woman we could compare to her; and as we both felt ourselves disqualified in different ways from any nearer approach, we were content to bask in the reflected rays of our brother's happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> lucky," [...] Rudi said. [...] "Klaus and I were--were visiting Tasso when it happened. This is her place." [...] He waved a {{big hand}} around. [...] "This little cellar. We {{finished}} {{and climbed the}} ladder to start back. From the ridge we saw. There they were, all around the bunker. Fighting was still going on. David and his bear. Hundreds of them. Klaus took the pictures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{put in the}} captain. [...] "We {{have all}} <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>been</b> {{accustomed}} to face danger, and to hold our lives in our hands in various ways, so it is no good turning back now. And now I vote we {{go down to the}} saloon and take an observation just for luck, you know." [...] And we did--through the bottom of a tumbler.|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{might do}} that,” the captain agreed; “but, {{like most of}} his class, he is superstitious, and I doubt whether he would go on board the wreck alone. Still, {{it will be better}} to take him with <b>us.</b> It <b>is</b> certain that there is no fear of our hut being {{disturbed}} during our absence, and if we should come upon natives <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> better than two.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Chris Wolstenholme also said: [...] ""New Born", I think {{between the}} <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} one <b>of</b> our favourite tracks off Origin of Symmetry. It {{is a good}} live track. I think it's {{one of the songs}} which showcases the experimental side of the band. It is not really a conventional pop song. I {{think a lot of the}} reason for choosing these songs is that we went for the heavier more direct kind of songs rather than going for anything too mellow".|$|R
60|$|The {{trial that}} {{followed}} I need not describe at length. It {{took a long}} while, and the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> called upon to give evidence as to the quarrel between our companion, the Professor, and the prisoner about the dog Pharaoh and other matters. The testimony, however, that proclaimed the guilt of Shadrach was that of his companion guides, who, it appeared, had been threatened with floggings unless they told the truth.|$|E
6000|$|We were yarning after dinner, and, whether because <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> fishermen, {{or simply}} {{that we were}} all English, our yarns were taking a {{competitive}} turn. The queerest thing seen during the War was the subject of our tongues, and it was not till after several tit-bits had been digested that Mallinson, the painter, ill and ironical, blue-eyed, and with a fair pointed beard, took his pipe out of his mouth, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even at {{this day}} I am {{surprised}} that all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> not captured by that army of boys, {{each of whom}} was armed {{with one of those}} disagreeable sling-shots, pea-shooters, or whatever you choose to call them. I was panting from long running, and my wife so excited as hardly to know whether she was on her feet or her ears, while poor little Sonny Bunny was so confused by seeing us in such a state that he actually quivered.|$|E
2500|$|Eddie August Schneider {{explained}} his motives in flying for the Republic: [...] "I was broke, hungry, jobless ... {{yet despite the}} fact that all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration’s program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer?" [...] The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never withdrawn their allegiance to the United States.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am John Woodcock," [...] {{said the}} host, [...] "and these gentlemen are Horne Tooke and James Bridges. All <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> friends to America. We {{have heard of}} you for some weeks past, and {{inferring}} from your conduct, that {{you must be a}} Yankee of the true blue stamp, we have resolved to employ you in a way which you cannot but gladly approve; for surely, though an exile, you are still willing to serve your country; if not as a sailor or soldier, yet as a traveller?" ...|$|R
500|$|Allan Kroeker, {{who was the}} {{director}} of [...] "Bound" [...] had previously directed two episodes earlier in the season, [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Fortunato praised {{the director}} and described the Orions, saying that they [...] "move very slowly, very seductively. I would like to compare us to snakes – we like to slither and creep around, versus a human. So we’re a little sneaky. The <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> trying to get something accomplished, and each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has our target, so to speak, to try to manipulate them to get what we want in the end." ...|$|R
