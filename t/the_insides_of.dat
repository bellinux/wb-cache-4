5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers to stay away from <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> their elbows. This is spread across {{their bodies and}} those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the year}} white-tailed deer will rub-urinate, a process during which a deer squats while urinating so that urine will run down <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the deer's legs, over the tarsal glands, {{and onto the}} hair {{covering}} these glands. Bucks rub-urinate more frequently during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> amphorae {{were often}} {{coated with a}} {{preservative}} resin, such as from the terebinth, and this imparted a pine flavor and aroma to the wine.

25|$|Snap front/legs : Some sleepers, {{especially}} in infant sizes, replace the usual front zipper with a front opening closing with snap fasteners. In infant sizes, this opening usually forks at the crotch, and extends down <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> both legs to the ankles, {{in order to}} give access for diaper changes. This design tends to be less effective at eliminating drafts than the zipper closure, and is most often seen on lighter-weight sleepers designed for warmer weather.|$|E

25|$|Henrique da Rocha Lima in 1916 then {{proved that}} the {{bacterium}} Rickettsia prowazekii was the agent responsible for typhus; he named it after H. T. Ricketts and Stanislaus von Prowazek, two zoologists who had died from typhus while investigating epidemics. Once these crucial facts were recognized, Rudolf Weigl in 1930 was able to fashion a practical and effective vaccine production method by grinding up <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> infected lice that had been drinking blood. It was, however, very dangerous to produce, and carried a high likelihood of infection {{to those who were}} working on it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} {{application of}} pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, {{the nape of}} the neck, and <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer Sophia Grojsman behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise. The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance {{so that it is}} released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening. Cologne fragrance is released rapidly, lasting around 2 hours. Eau de toilette lasts from 2 to 4 hours, while perfume may last up to six hours.|$|E
