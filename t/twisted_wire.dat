25|$|The {{dressage}} horse {{at lower}} levels is only permitted to be shown at recognized competitions in a snaffle bit, though the detail regarding bitting varies slightly from organization to organization. The loose-ring snaffle with a single- or double-joint is most commonly seen. Harsher snaffle bits, such as <b>twisted</b> <b>wire,</b> corkscrews, slow-twists, and waterfords are not permitted, nor are pelhams, kimberwickes, or gag bits. Upper level and FEI dressage horses are shown in a double bridle, using both a bradoon and a curb bit with a smooth curb chain.|$|E

It's possible {{we will never know}} specifically how she died." [...] Arden found damage to her hyoid bone, suggesting possible strangulation, but did not deem it to be conclusive evidence of such a cause of death. On June 6, after the police completed their search, private investigators hired by the Levys found her shin bone with some <b>twisted</b> <b>wire</b> about [...] from the other remains.

Therefore, it is carefully considered when choosing a bit for a horse. [...] Many mouthpieces are not allowed in certain competitions. [...] Bit mouthpieces may be single jointed, double-jointed, [...] "mullen" [...] (a straight bar), or have an arched port in the center of varying height, with or without joints. [...] Some have rollers, rings or small [...] "keys" [...] that the horse can move with its tongue.

50|$|<b>Twisted</b> pair <b>wiring</b> - <b>Twisting</b> <b>wires</b> very tightly {{together}} in a circuit will dramatically reduce electromagnetic noise. <b>Twisting</b> the <b>wires</b> decreases the loop size in which a magnetic field can run through to produce a current between the wires.

60|$|As we {{left the}} bank of the Fraser River we put all wheel tracks behind. The trail turned to the west and began to climb, {{following}} an old swath which had been cut into the black pines by an adventurous telegraph company in 1865. Immense sums of money were put into this venture by men who believed the ocean cable could not be laid. The work was stopped midway by the success of Field's wonderful plan, and all along the roadway the rusted and <b>twisted</b> <b>wire</b> lay in testimony of the seriousness of the original design.|$|E

Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To achieve small {{delay and}} low {{crosstalk}} for multiple signal nets with capacitive and inductive coupling, we propose {{in this paper}} a novel interconnect structure, staggered twisted-bundle wires where groups of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> are staggered. This new structure {{is different from the}} previously proposed <b>twisted</b> bundle <b>wires</b> with one group of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> and another group of normal wires. Using accurate circuit models and efficient algorithms to find the worst case noise and delay for comprehensive combinations of signal patterns and a range of arrival times, we assume signal and shielding ratio over 1 : 1 for area reduction and compare the aforementioned two structures to coplanar shielding for signal nets. The staggered twisted-bundle has the smallest worst case delay, up to 20 % and 5 % smaller than the coplanar shielding and twisted bundle, respectively. The staggered twisted bundle also has the smallest worst case noise, up to 6 % and 12 % less than coplanar shielding and twisted bundle. Furthermore, the staggered twisted bundle has the smallest delay/noise variation between signal nets. We conclude that without increasing routing area, the staggered twisted bundle is better than the twisted bundle and coplanar shielding in terms of performance and noise. I...|$|R
