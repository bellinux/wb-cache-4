40|$|Émile Baudot’s {{printing}} telegraph was {{the first}} widely adopted device to encode letters, numbers, and symbols as uniform-length binary sequences. Donald Murray introduced a second successful code of this type, the details of which continued to evolve until versions of Baudot’s and Murray’s codes were standardized as International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabets</b> No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. These codes were used for decades before the appearance of computers and the changing needs of communications required the design and standardization of a new code. Years of debate and compromise resulted in the ECMA- 6 standard in Europe, the ASCII standard in the United States, and the ISO 646 and International Alphabet No. 5 standards internationally.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} was the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2), a five bits code. IA5 is an improvement based on seven bits bytes.|$|E
50|$|Murray's system {{became the}} International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2) or Murray Code, {{that was in}} use until supplanted by the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) that was {{introduced}} in 1963.|$|E
50|$|The Baudot code, a five-bit encoding, {{was created}} by Émile Baudot in 1870, {{patented}} in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.|$|E
50|$|The enciphering/deciphering {{equipment}} {{was called a}} Geheimschreiber (secret writer) which, like Enigma, used a symmetrical substitution alphabet. The teleprinter code used was the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2)—Murray's modification of the 5-bit Baudot code.|$|E
5000|$|Ellison uses an {{alternating}} pair of punchcode tapes as time-breaks—representing AMs [...] "talkfields"—throughout {{the short}} story. The bars are encoded in International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No 2 (ITA2), a character coding system developed for teletypewriter machines.|$|E
5000|$|Members of the {{programming}} team found it useful {{to commit to}} memory the following sequence of characters which represented the numbers 0 to 31 in the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 1 (Baudot) 5-bit binary code of the paper tape that was used for input and output.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, the CCITT {{introduced}} the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2) code {{as an international}} standard, {{which was based on}} the Western Union code with some minor changes. The US standardized on a version of ITA2 called the American Teletypewriter code (US TTY) which was the basis for 5-bit teletypewriter codes until the debut of 7-bit ASCII in 1963.|$|E

50|$|Data is encoded using 7 unit binary codes sent using a seven {{bit error}} {{detecting}} code called van Duuren code or CCITT <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 3. The data is sent in two channels labelled A and B, or four channels labeled A, B, C and D. Data from the different channels are interleaved using a time division multiplex system. The two channel system is called ARQ-M2, the four channel system is called ARQ-M4.|$|E
50|$|In 1897 the Baudot {{system was}} {{improved}} by switching to punched tape, which was prepared offline like the Morse tape {{used with the}} Wheatstone and Creed systems. A tape reader, controlled by the Baudot distributor, then replaced the manual keyboard. The tape had five rows of holes for the code, with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism. Baudot’s code was later standardised as International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> Number One.|$|E
50|$|The Baudot code, {{invented by}} Émile Baudot, is a {{character}} set predating EBCDIC and ASCII. It was the predecessor to the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2), the teleprinter code in use until the advent of ASCII. Each character in the alphabet is represented {{by a series of}} five bits, sent over a communication channel such as a telegraph wire or a radio signal. The symbol rate measurement is known as baud, and is derived from the same name.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alphabet}} {{used in the}} ARQ-E protocol is {{an extension}} of the CCITT <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 more commonly known as Baudot. [...] This alphabet has five bits, and therefore has 25 or 32 different possible symbols. The ARQ-M alphabet being synchronous always has to send data and does not have gaps between characters. It does not include start and stop bits that would be used in asynchronous transmissions. In asynchronous transmissions a steady stop signal indicates that there is nothing to send.|$|E
5000|$|Gerke {{perceived}} the disadvantages of the American Morse code and changed {{nearly half of}} it into its present form, the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet.</b> The original Morse code consisted of four different hold durations (the amount of time the key was held down), and some letters contained inconsistent internal durations of silence. In Gerke's system there are only [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs", the latter being three times {{as long as the}} former, and the internal silence intervals are always a single dit-time each. This new code was first adopted by the Deutsch-Oesterreichischer Telegraphenverein and in 1865 accepted by a convent of the International Telegraph Union in Paris.|$|E
50|$|The X3.2 {{subcommittee}} designed ASCII {{based on}} the earlier teleprinter encoding systems. Like other character encodings, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols (i.e. graphemes and control characters). This allows digital devices {{to communicate with each}} other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters, 10 numerical digits, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT) International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2) standard of 1924, FIELDATA (1956), and early EBCDIC (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.|$|E
50|$|Telex {{provided}} the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as {{specified by the}} International Telecommunication Union. Customers on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, telex messages were normally first encoded onto paper tape and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute encoded using the International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2. In the late days of the telex networks, end-user equipment was often replaced by modems and phone lines as well, reducing the telex network to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{teleprinters}} {{used the}} 5-bit International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2). This limited the character set to 32 codes (25 = 32). One {{had to use}} a [...] "FIGS" [...] shift key to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The ITA2 code was used asynchronously with start and stop bits: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as FIELDATA and Flexowriter, were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.|$|E
50|$|Text was {{encoded in}} several ways. The {{earliest}} standard character encoding was Baudot, which {{dates back to}} the nineteenth century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed), Western Union code, International <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA 2), and American Teletypewriter code (USTTY), were used. Other standards, such as Teletypesetter (TTS), FIELDATA and Flexowriter, had six holes. In the early 1960s, the American Standards Association led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as ASCII. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alphabet}} {{used in the}} ARQ-M protocol {{is based}} on the CCITT <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 more commonly known as Baudot. [...] This alphabet has five bits, and therefore has 25 or 32 different possible symbols. It uses letters shift and figures shifts to select different sets of characters similar to a typewriter. The ARQ-M alphabet being synchronous always has to send data and does not have gaps between characters. It does not include start and stop bits that would be used in asynchronous transmissions and so saves on those two bits per character. In asynchronous transmissions a steady stop signal indicates that there is nothing to send. A prolonged start signal can be used for signalling, for example to select a destination for a telex connection.|$|E
50|$|With {{the other}} special {{characters}} and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code. There was some debate {{at the time}} whether {{there should be more}} control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet. The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks 6 and 7, and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard. The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting. Locating the lowercase letters in sticks 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.|$|E
5000|$|The ARQ-M {{characters}} are remapped to a seven bit {{system so that}} there are always three bits on and four bits off. The ARQ code is a Moore code, which can detect the modification of any single bit. This alphabet is CCITT <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 3 aka TOR No. 3. This differs from the alphabet used in the ARQ-E single channel system. [...] Three additional control signals are added to the 32 from the Baudot set. Out of 128 seven bit characters there are 35 that have three one bits set, so allowing for the 32 Baudot and three control codes to just be accommodated. The extra control {{characters are}} RQ, meaning request repeat, α meaning constant space condition, which may indicate the end of a connection (break signal) or be used to signal information, such as a number to connect to, and the β character, meaning constant mark condition, used when there is nothing to send. The RQ signal is also called Signal Roman one and may be designated [...] "I".|$|E
