5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as {{the founder of the}} school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in Political Justice (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> peaceful evolution.|$|E

5|$|Large {{deposits}} {{of fossil fuels}} are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World {{for the treatment of}} diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh emerged as the political capital in the fourteenth century. Largely as a result of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Nina Gold and Robert Sterne are the series' primary casting directors. <b>Through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> auditions and readings, {{the main}} cast was assembled. The only {{exceptions}} were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009. Other actors signed {{for the pilot}} were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon. Addy was, according to showrunners Benioff and Weiss, the easiest actor to cast for the show, being that his audition was on point. Catelyn Stark {{was scheduled to be}} played by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley. Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant.

On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control of the crime scene to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) led the crime scene investigation at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} coalesced, {{first into}} clans (ubwoko), and then, by 1700, into around eight kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda, {{ruled by the}} Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became the dominant kingdom from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> conquest and assimilation, and achieving its greatest extent under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. The Berlin Conference of 1884 assigned the territory to Germany, which began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy, and supporting Tutsi chiefs around the country. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgians modernised the Rwandan economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
5|$|When the {{protostar}} {{has grown}} {{such that it}} ignites to form a star, the surviving disk {{is removed from the}} inside outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects. Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb. Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} Nova Muscae 1983, GQ Muscae is a binary system {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and small star that is about 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion star via its accretion disc. After a certain amount has accumulated the star erupts, {{as it did in}} 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The soft X-ray transient GRS 1124-683 (also known as Nova Muscae 1991) is a binary object {{consisting of a}}n orange main-sequence star (GU Muscae) of spectral type K3V–K4V and a black hole of around 6 solar masses. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> positron annihilation. GR Muscae is an X-ray source composed of a neutron star of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of our Sun and a low-mass star likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, SY Muscae is a symbiotic star system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger star is transferring mass to the smaller, there is no periodic eruption nor accretion disc formed. The star system varies in magnitude from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E
