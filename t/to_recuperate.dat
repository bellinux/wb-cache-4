50|$|SAS combats {{often have}} {{unexpected}} conclusions. At Montceau-les-Mines, {{a group of}} paratroopers and a fist section of the Free French Forces, made opposing forces, much more superior in numbers, believe that the effectif of a division was encircling them. Accordingly, they managed <b>to</b> <b>recuperated</b> hundreds of prisoners, tanks and cannons. At {{the end of the}} campaign, the 3rd Parachute Chasseur Regiment 3eRCP endured the loss of 80 out of 400 effectifs. In their time existence, the men's regiment placed thousands of opposing forces out of their combat element along with some 383 vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Scruton contends, {{following}} Immanuel Kant, {{that human}} beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for self-reflection. He argues {{that we are in}} an era of secularization without precedent {{in the history of the}} world; writers and artists such as Rainer Maria Rilke, T. S. Eliot, Edward Hopper and Arnold Schoenberg [...] "devoted much energy <b>to</b> <b>recuperating</b> the experience of the sacred—but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness." [...] Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.|$|R

Hamence also occasionally opened the bowling in the tour matches with his gentle medium pace, allowing the team's leading bowlers <b>to</b> <b>recuperate</b> between Tests.|$|E
5|$|On {{account of}} his {{increasingly}} failing health, Gilkeson spent the summer of 1921 in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, <b>to</b> <b>recuperate.</b> About a week before his death, Gilkeson fell {{down a flight of}} porch steps at his vacation residence, fracturing a number of bones.

50|$|However, Bates had $200,000 in {{outstanding}} debt and a pledged $100,000 to Bates College after his death. His family was required expend the $100,000 pledged {{but due to}} conditions placed on the inheritances, restricted distribution, and familial debt, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts eventually ruled that Bates' heirs {{did not have to}} pay Bates College the pledged $100,000. After a period of recession the college began <b>to</b> financially <b>recuperate</b> <b>to</b> a larger endowment, independently. Over {{the next couple of years}} Bates College's endowment has grown slowly and steadily.|$|R
5|$|Sensing {{that there}} was growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, who were agitating for armed insurrection, Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the government's response. However, Lenin's health had deteriorated as he experienced headaches and insomnia and possibly began to experience the miniature heart attacks which would later afflict him. Nadezhda helped care for him, but was in poor health herself. He left Petrograd for the Finnish village of Neivola, where he visited his friend Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich <b>to</b> <b>recuperate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{death in}} 1986 of {{her younger sister}} Felicité, {{who had lived in}} the top floor of her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from {{depression}} and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed tuberculosis and she was hospitalised. After a torrid time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California <b>to</b> <b>recuperate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was {{prevented}} by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll {{had been on the}} mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications).

5|$|The {{work was}} opened four months late on 18 October 1925 by Prince Arthur and the Reverend Alfred Jarvis. Despite the delay, the RAWCF and Jagger parted on very good terms, the {{committee}} exceptionally {{pleased with the}} final memorial.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced {{at the end of its}} tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding further to the burden on the remaining battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left the province <b>to</b> <b>recuperate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species <b>to</b> <b>recuperate</b> in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
5|$|He made {{a painful}} single in 25 minutes of batting {{before it became}} too much.

5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health.

5|$|On December 29, 1876, {{a bridge}} over Ohio's Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge {{had been built}} from metal cast at one of Stone's mills, and was {{carrying}} a train {{owned and operated by}} Stone's Lake Shore and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily on Stone, who departed for Europe <b>to</b> <b>recuperate</b> and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute, and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel, The Bread-Winners (1883).|$|E
