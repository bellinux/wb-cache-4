5|$|On 8 February 1945, Rudel {{was badly}} wounded in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot,</b> and crash landed inside German lines. Rudel's leg was amputated below the knee. He {{returned}} to flying on 25 March 1945. He claimed 26 more tanks {{destroyed by the}} end of the war. On 19 April 1945, the day before Hitler's final birthday, Rudel met with Hitler in the Führerbunker at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. On 8 May 1945, Rudel fled westward from an airfield near Prague, landing in US controlled territory, and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Thescelosaurus {{would have}} browsed {{in the first}} meter or so from the ground, feeding selectively, with food held in the mouth by cheeks while chewing. Thescelosaurus was {{probably}} slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the upper leg was longer than the shin, the opposite of Hypsilophodon and running animals in general. One specimen {{is known to have}} had a bone pathology, with the long bones of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> fused at their tops, hindering swift movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from axilla (armpit) to groin, averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from axilla to groin along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the fourth toe of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot,</b> there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that provide traction for geckos. The escutcheons (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs, varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E

25|$|The {{footwork}} {{is a basic}} side-tap, side-tap. For example, {{the left}} foot moves to the left with a weight-shift to the left foot. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> then 'taps' (touching the floor without weight-shift) next to the left foot. This {{is followed by the}} same movement to the other side: <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> moves back to the right with a weigh-shift to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot,</b> and the left foot comes back to tap beside the right.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{the left}} corner forward who wears the number 15 jersey is to watch the full forward's breaks and to score as many points and goals as possible. The full forward line {{operates}} around the opposition's 21-metre line.

Wins against George Mason, hometown FSU, and Georgia Tech would push the Hogs to their second College World Series.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{typically}} involves sensory {{and motor}} loss, {{as well as}} painful physical perceptions (paresthesias), though all sensory modalities may be involved. Symptoms that affect the sensory and motor systems seem to develop symmetrically. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> is affected, the left foot is affected simultaneously or soon becomes affected. In most cases, the legs are affected first, followed by the arms. The hands usually become involved when the symptoms reach above the ankle. This is called a stocking-and-glove pattern of sensory disturbances.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} an attempt to model the midfoot height of adult females. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>feet</b> of 24 Hong Kong Chinese females were laser scanned. The midfoot heights were then {{determined}} at intervals of 1. 2 mm. These heights showed a significant relationship with normalized length along the foot. The fitted model had R 2 = 0. 937 and has important implications for the design of the vamp area of a shoe...|$|R

25|$|The {{description}} of Kalantaka {{is found in}} Agamic texts. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> should be rested on a lotus-pedestal (padma-pitha) and the left leg lifted to kick Yama, just touching his chest. The leg positions are reversed in some textual descriptions. Sometimes, Shiva is depicted as rising from the linga that Markandeya is worshipping and his right leg is buried in the linga while the left one raised to strike Yama. Shiva, depicted red in anger, should have a third eye on the forehead, a jatamukuta (a crown of matted hair), lateral tusks and four or eight arms.|$|E
25|$|Henry Marshall Ashby {{enlisted in}} the Confederate States Army on July 6, 1861 at Knoxville, Tennessee, {{organized}} a company of cavalry and was elected captain. This company {{was assigned to the}} 4th Tennessee Cavalry Battalion which became part of the 2nd Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. Ashby was elected colonel of the regiment on May 24, 1862. The 2nd Texas Cavalry operated in east Tennessee in 1862 and 1863, usually in the brigade of Brigadier General John Pegram. Ashby was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> during one of three raids into Kentucky made by his regiment during 1862.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Welk left Dot Records {{and joined}} its former {{executive}} Randy Wood in creating Ranwood Records. Welk bought back all his masters from Dot and Coral, and Ranwood became the outlet {{for all of}} Welk's many artists. They started with a huge reissue of old Dot albums in 1968 to get them started on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot.</b> Wood's interest was sold to Welk in 1979. In 2015, Welk Music Group sold the Vanguard and Sugar Hill labels to Concord Bicycle Music while retaining ownership of the Ranwood catalog. Welk's estate licensed the Ranwood catalogue to Concord Music Group for 10 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E
25|$|The first final on {{the opening}} day was the triple jump (then known as the hop, skip and jump), one of the events in which Connolly competed. Connolly's style, taking two hops with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot,</b> is no longer allowed in this event nowadays, but was {{perfectly}} acceptable in 1896. With this style, he outjumped the field, finishing more than one meter ahead of his nearest opponent by jumping 13.71 m (44ft 11 3/4 in), earning him the first silver medal (gold medals did not yet exist). With this performance, {{he became the first}} Olympic champion since AD 385, when the Athenian Zopyrus won the pankration (other sources name the Armenian Varasdates, who won at boxing in 369).|$|E
25|$|Benvenuto Cellini worked {{almost ten}} years on this bronze (1545-1554). His wax design was {{immediately}} approved by Cosimo I de' Medici. He met numerous difficulties which, according to his autobiography, almost {{brought him to the}} brink of death. The casting of this bronze statue was several times unsuccessful. When attempting again, the melting furnace got overheated, spoiling the casting of the bronze. Cellini gave orders to feed the furnace with his household furniture and finally with about 200 pewter dishes and plates, and his pots and pans. This caused the bronze to flow again. After the bronze had cooled, the statue was finished, except for three toes on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>foot.</b> These were added later.|$|E
