40|$|BACKGROUND The {{purpose of}} the IC System {{instrumentation}} is to initiate actions to ensure adequate core cooling when the reactor vessel is isolated from its primary heat sink (the main condenser). A more complete discussion of IC System operation is provided in the Bases of LCO 3. 5. 3, "IC System. " The IC System may be initiated by either automatic or manual means. Automatic initiation occurs for sustained (about 17 seconds) conditions of reactor vessel pressure high. The variable is monitored by four pressure switches that are connected to four time delay relays. The outputs of the time delay relays are connected in a one-out-of-two logic to a <b>trip</b> <b>relay.</b> The output of the <b>trip</b> <b>relays</b> are connected in a two-out-of-two logic arrangement. Once initiated, the IC logic can be overridden by the operator...|$|R

While one crew is driving, the other {{has the opportunity to}} sleep onboard the train. The current study investigated the impact of relay work on drivers sleep quantity and quality. Fourteen drivers wore wrist activity monitors and completed sleep/wake diaries for 3 d prior to and during short (< 48 h) <b>relay</b> <b>trips.</b> Drivers obtained an average of 7. 8 h sleep per night while at home, and an average of 4 h sleep per opportunity during the <b>relay</b> <b>trip.</b> Sleep obtained in the relay van was associated with longer sleep onset latencies, lower efficiency and poorer subjective quality than sleep at home. During the <b>relay</b> <b>trip,</b> drivers obtained significantly more sleep during opportunities that occurred in the evening, than those that occurred early morning or during the day. These findings suggest that while drivers are able to obtain sleep during short relay operations, it is of poorer quality than sleep obtained at home.

By studying their trips to Goa we renegotiate popular concepts in tourism studies, such as authenticity and escape, {{from the perspective of}} non-western tourist experiences. During ethnographic research, including both participant observation and interviews in Bangalore and Goa, interviewees emphasized Goa as a place where they could be their ‘true selves’. They juxtaposed this ‘true self’ with the traditional roles they performed back home. This contrasts with previous tourism studies, which argue that tourism can be seen as facilitating escape from alienating modern experiences. However, the tourist <b>trips</b> <b>relayed</b> in the interviews were highly repetitive. We therefore argue that notions of social practice and scripting of the performances of modern subject positions are more suitable means of interpretation than psychological notions of the self. Goa facilitates not the emergence of the ‘true self’ but rather the enactment of such a position in a scripted manner. We conclude that research on non-western tourists requires a reconsideration of some of the conceptual foundations of the field...|$|R
