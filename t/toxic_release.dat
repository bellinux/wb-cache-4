25|$|DuPont {{has been}} sued by 1,995 people who claim dioxin {{emissions}} from DuPont's plant in DeLisle, Mississippi, caused their cancers, illnesses or loved ones' deaths; of these only 850 were pending as of June 2008. In August 2005, Glen Strong, an oyster fisherman with the rare blood cancer multiple myeloma, was awarded $14 million from DuPont, but the ruling was overturned June 5, 2008, by a Mississippi jury who found DuPont's plant had {{no connection to}} Mr. Strong's disease. In another case, parents claimed dioxin from pollution caused {{the death of their}} 8-year-old daughter; the trial took place in the summer of 2007, and a jury wholly rejected the family's claims, as no scientific connection could be proven between DuPont and the family's tragic loss. DuPont's DeLisle plant is one of three titanium dioxide facilities (including Edgemoor, Delaware, and New Johnsonville, Tennessee) that are the largest producers of dioxin in the country, according to the US EPA's <b>Toxic</b> <b>Release</b> Inventory. DuPont maintains its operations are safe and environmentally responsible.|$|E

40|$|According to {{modernization}} theory, enforcement {{schemes that}} rely on end-of-the-pipe regulation are not as effective at achieving improved environmental performance as market-based approaches that encourage pollution prevention. Consistent with that observation, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency transitioned {{to the use of}} self-policing to encourage pollution prevention. Other studies note that environmental compliance is significantly affected by traditional “command-and-control” strategies. Using Prais Winston regression we examine these contrasting views by estimating the relationship between <b>toxic</b> <b>releases,</b> self-policing, and criminal prosecutions from 1988 through 2014. Initial correlations suggest that (1) self-policing is not associated with <b>toxic</b> <b>releases</b> but that (2) criminal prosecutions may reduce <b>toxic</b> <b>releases</b> through general deterrence signals. Subsequent analyses controlling for gross domestic product revealed that neither self-policing nor criminal enforcement correlate with <b>toxic</b> <b>releases</b> but that gross domestic product was the strongest predictor of emissions.

Some community members also expressed concerns that chemical releases, as reported on EPA’s <b>Toxic</b> <b>Release</b> Inventory, from the DuPont plant could have contaminated the community’s water and air. DuPont DeLisle's titanium dioxide plant reported the third highest amount of dioxin-like compounds in EPA’s <b>Toxic</b> <b>Release</b> Inventory (TRI).

40|$|Process {{equipment}} failures play significant {{roles in}} most accidents that occur and recur in the chemical process industry resulting in fire, explosion, and <b>toxic</b> <b>release.</b> In this study, 50 equipment-related accident investigation reports {{were used to}} analyze type and severity of incidents. The comprehensive accident report data were retrieved from U. S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) and U. S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident databases with a mean year of 2005. Among the identified process equipment failures were piping systems (32 %), storage tanks (20 %), process vessels (16 %), separation equipment (10 %), reactors (8 %), heat transfer equipment (8 %), and others (6 %). The analysis shows that 32 % of the cases led to fire and explosion, followed by <b>toxic</b> <b>release</b> (26 %), and explosion (22 %) incidents. A total of 126 fatalities, 590 injuries, 260 exposures, four shelter-in-place, and 13 evacuations were reported. In most accident cases, fire, explosion, and/or <b>toxic</b> <b>release</b> incidents occur simultaneously. The synergy between major hazards results in catastrophic accidents with severe consequences in numbers of fatalities, injuries, exposures, shelter-in-place, and evacuations. To minimize the losses, plant and equipment should be designed and prepared for the worst-case scenario, not just adapting to any ‘applicable’ standards or guidance...|$|E
