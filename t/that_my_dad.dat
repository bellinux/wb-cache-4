[...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E

[...] Around <b>that</b> time, <b>my</b> <b>dad's</b> girlfriend moved up from London and I thought she was terribly chic. She always used to wear Warehouse, which had just opened and was really good, because Jeff Banks was still in charge. So there are photos of me aged twelve wearing waist-high tight red jeans with a puffed-sleeved blue sweater and awful hair, and then aged thirteen in an ankle-length black gathered skirt, white shirt tucked in, braces, a black tie, black lace tights, navy blue stilettos and a black beret with a veil.

I was a daddy’s girl from the moment I was born. His third daughter, I imagine he was hoping for a boy.

My middle name, Brook, qualifies his favorite fish in conjunction with my last name, Trout. My driver’s license elicits numerous comments and questions whenever strangers take note of my incredibly unique name. “Your parents sure must have a great sense of humor!” Often they would call someone else over to see the spectacle of my printed name. At this point I force a polite chuckle while inwardly groaning. Even more frequently I get, “Is your dad a fisherman?...|$|R

These ideas were consistent throughout the interviews, regardless of generational status and regardless of whether the person attended college or not. The differences came in the experiences of navigating the educational system in this country. There was a stark contrast between the paths to success of my maternal and paternal sides of the family. I propose <b>that</b> because <b>my</b> <b>dad's</b> side of the family immigrated sooner and assimilated faster in American society, they were able to take advantage of more resources available to them.
