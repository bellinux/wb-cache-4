Evidence presented at Göth's trial indicates he delegated this task to a subordinate, SS-Hauptscharführer Josef Grzimek, who was sent to assist camp commandant SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Kellermann with mass killings. Between 21 September 1943 and 3February 1944 the camp was gradually liquidated.

Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay.

5|$|Late on September 1, {{when the}} storm began to retrograde, {{hurricane}} warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle, Louisiana, as advisories along {{the west coast of}} the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire. By the time officials lifted evacuation orders, the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety. Roughly 250,000 people in the Florida Panhandle, 175,000 in Alabama, 70,000 in Mississippi, and 50,000 in Louisiana—a total of 545,000—were ordered to leave. Several hundred <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier, and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve. Governor Graham's office reported that during the entire storm event, 1.25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point, and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000. In total, nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 1941, Pećanac sent {{a request}} to Milan Nedić, {{the head of the}} Serbian puppet government, for {{stronger}} organisation, supplies, arms, salary funds, and more. Over time, his requests were fulfilled and a German liaison officer was appointed at Pećanac's headquarters to help coordinate actions. According to German data, on 17 January 1942 72 Chetnik officers and 7,963 men were being provided for by the Serbian Gendarmerie Command. This fell short of the maximum authorized size of 8,745 men and included two or three <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> Mihailović's Chetniks who were legalized in November 1941. In the same month, Pećanac sought permission from the Italians for his forces to move into eastern Montenegro, but was refused over Italian concerns that the Chetniks would move into the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1982, Kassar {{announced}} that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were {{cut from a}} 50 percent increase over 1981, down to a 15 percent increase. Immediately following the announcement, Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent—from US$54 to US$35—resulting in the company losing US$1.3billion in market valuation. Kassar sold five <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> his Warner shares a half-hour before the announcement. This prompted an investigation for insider trading against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atari attempted to regain their market share by licensing popular arcade games for the Atari consoles. The games, however, did not reverse Atari's decline and they went further into debt. In 1983, the company had decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost US$356million. Other companies—Activision, Bally Manufacturing, and Mattel—experienced similar results as the industry declined.|$|E

5|$|On the Byzantine side, Emperor Michael III had {{assembled}} his army {{to counter the}} Arab raid, and met them at a battle in an area called Marj al-Usquf ("Bishop's Meadow") by Arab sources, a highland near Malakopeia, north of Nazianzus. The battle was bloody with many casualties on both sides; according to the Persian historian al-Tabari, only a <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> Umar's army survived. Nevertheless, the Arabs managed to escape the Byzantines and continue their raid north into the Armeniac Theme, eventually reaching the Black Sea and sacking {{the port city of}} Amisos. The Byzantine historians report that Umar, enraged at the sea blocking his advance, ordered it to be lashed, but this is most likely inspired by the similar account of Xerxes during the Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} {{technetium}} occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More than a <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> such periods {{have passed since}} {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.|$|E
