40|$|Abstract—With an {{increased}} adoption of <b>technologies</b> <b>like</b> <b>wireless</b> sensor networks by real-world applications, dynamic network topologies are becoming the rule {{rather than the}} exception. Node mobility, however, introduces a range of problems (communication interference, path uncertainty, low quality of service and information loss, etc.) that are not handled well by periodically refreshing state information, as algorithms designed for static networks typically do. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the introduction of a novel mechanism (called ASH) {{for the creation of a}} quasi-static overlay on top of a mobile topology. It is powered by simple, local interactions between nodes and exhibits selfhealing and self-organization capabilities with respect to failures and node mobility. We show that the overlay mechanism works without assumptions about position, orientation, speed, motion correlation, and trajectory prediction of the nodes. A preliminary evaluation by means of simulation shows that ASH succeeds in tackling node mobility, while consuming only minimal resources.

40|$|Predicting performance-related {{behavior}} of the underlying network structure {{becomes more and more}} indispensable in terms of the aspired application outcome quality. However, the reliable forecast of QoS metrics like packet transfer delay in wireless network systems is still a challenging task. Even though existing approaches are technically capable of determining such network properties under certain assumptions, they mostly abstract away from primal aspects that inherently have an essential impact on temporal network performance dynamics. Also, they usually require auxiliary resources to be implemented and deployed along with the actual network components. In the course of developing a lightweight measurement-based alternative for the self-inspection and prediction of volatile performance characteristics in environments of any kind, we selectively investigate the duration of message delivery and packet loss rate against various parameters peculiar to common radio network <b>technologies</b> <b>like</b> <b>Wireless</b> Sensor Networks (WSNs).

We validate our prediction method against basic multi-hop networking scenarios.

It discusses the possible differentiations of collaboration along time and space. Collaborators can work together at the same place, which means co-located or distributed in different places, cities or even countries. Furthermore they can work synchronous or asynchronous, which is the basis for many web applications or required when group members are in different time zones. Because until today the most information visualizations are designed for single-users it is necessary to analyze the requirements and characteristics for collaboration in information visualization. New <b>technologies</b> <b>like</b> <b>wireless</b> networks, higher bandwidth and bigger screens which vary from wall-size displays to interactive tabletops, bring up many new possibilities for collaborative visualizations. But they also raise questions and challenges about how to design and develop these applications.

It is important to figure out how applications should be developed so that they do not only enable collaboration but rather support {{it in a way that}} the advantages have some effects.

The service continuity {{can be measured in}} terms of a satisfied user criteria, which consists e. g. of the perceived end to end data packet delay, i. e. transport layer packet delay. The IEEE 802. 21 standard focuses on the support of media independent handover for a broad range of technologies, but with strong emphasis on 802 technologies. The Framework Programme (FP) 7 European Project OMEGA investigates the performance of home networks, which consist of <b>technologies</b> <b>like</b> <b>Wireless</b> Local Area Networks (WLAN), Hybrid Wireless Optics (HWO) or Power Line Communications (PLC). The aim of this work is to investigate {{in the context of the}} OMEGA project, which functions of the IEEE 802. 21 standard are needed in order to co-operate in heterogeneous home networks. Subsequently, their performance in terms of QoS evaluation are developed. One of the most important functions is the path selection since it establishes the flow between source and destination and simultaneously, deals with the reservation of resources. In this work an approach for the identification and selection of possible paths using signal flow graphs analytically has been evaluated. The scheme is based on ad hoc networks and the proposed algorithm is Bandwidth Guaranteed Source Routing (BGSR). The analysis provides information about the required delay in the selection and helps to evaluate the influence of the route selection in the uninterrupted provision of service.

In order to achieve this collaboration, supply chains also realize the need to implement integrated collaboration tools, which integrate tightly their intra- and inter-supply chain processes.

40|$|Abstract- Wireless {{communication}} technology {{has given us}} convenient ways to transfer information from one point to other anywhere in the world. The recent popularity of wireless networks results in many additional requirements of the system, especially the need of high data rates, demand for high quality multimedia services and the requirement of the greater bandwidth. The Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio communication is providing a new direction to utilize the radio spectrum for the broader short-range radio communications. Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is a revolutionary wireless technology used to transmit large amounts of digital data over short distances (up to 230 feet) over a very wide bandwidth (from 1 gigahertz [GHz] up to 10 GHz) and at very low power levels (less than 0. 5 milli watt). Unlike typical radio frequency broadcasts that use continuous sine waves to transmit data, UWB uses precisely positioned pulses at specific time intervals to transmit the signals across a wide spectrum. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless is a rapidly growing technology that promises to revolutionize low power, short-range wireless applications. UWB has quickly emerged as the leading <b>technology</b> for applications <b>like</b> <b>wireless</b> Universal Serial Bus (USB) and short-range ground penetrating radars.

30|$|In this paper, {{our focus}} is on {{applications}} which require multiple readers to service an area with RFID tags. For such deployments a centralized controller exists (could {{be one of the}} readers) which can communicate with all the readers using a Local Area Network (LAN) <b>technology</b> <b>like</b> Ethernet or <b>Wireless</b> LAN and can also serve as a database or data collection point. The purpose of the reader deployment may be to identify the tags as they move along on a conveyor belt, to gather information about the location of objects in a supply chain, or just inventory the items in the area. For example, pallets loaded with tagged items may move through docks in a warehouse to be scanned. Multiple such docks are typically located in close proximity, with readers continuously scanning to identify tags and send collected information for processing to a centralized database. In these scenarios, it is preferable to minimize the delay in reading tags so that each reader gets to scan as often as possible so as not to miss identifying any tags. This also allows the pallets to pass through as fast as possible, speeding up the entire operation. For these applications we can define the total tag reading delay as the time required to collectively read/identify all tags in the interrogation zone of the readers. Our main interest in this paper is to propose a protocol to solve the set of reader collision problems in a way that minimizes total tag reading delay.|$|R
