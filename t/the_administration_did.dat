5|$|On June 29, 2006, the Court {{issued a}} 5–3 {{decision}} holding {{that it had}} jurisdiction, and that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization, {{because they did not}} comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention (which the court found to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice).|$|E
5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than {{an interpretation of the}} law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, the NAACP {{organized}} {{opposition to}} President Woodrow Wilson's introduction of racial segregation into federal government policy, workplaces, and hiring. African-American women's clubs {{were among the}} organizations that protested Wilson's changes, but <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not alter its assuagement of Southern cabinet members and the Southern block in Congress.|$|E
25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly {{with a small group}} of strike leaders to hammer out an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not feel compelled to recognize the union. But <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and the Russian tsar {{established}} the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. Although a Governor-General was installed by the Russians as the highest authority within the Grand Duchy, much of the political system remained the same: Finland was allowed to keep its ”laws, religion and language” from the Swedish time. The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernisation in Russia; Finnish was not an option at that time as official language, as <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.|$|E

25|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} in November 1952, and in August 1953 his advisors began strategizing ways to force Bott's resignation so that a new General Counsel could be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate prior to the November 1954 mid-term elections. When White House Chief of Staff Sherman Adams let Bott know in March 1954 that the administration wanted him out, Bott refused to resign and threatened to sue if he was fired. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not force the issue at that time, since it had not settled on a replacement. The early favorite was NLRB member Philip Ray Rodgers, and his candidacy was pushed by Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks and Senator William F. Knowland (R-CA). The New York Times reported on June 24, 1954, that Rodgers was the administration's choice to replace Bott. But liberal Republicans within the administration opposed Rodgers, and fought for their own candidate. Two months later, Eisenhower announced that his choice for General Counsel was, instead, Theopil C. Kammholz. The administration actually nominated Kammholz in August 1954, but opposition from Senators James E. Murray (D-MT) and Herbert H. Lehman (D-NY) opposed him and the Senate Labor Committee did not act on the nomination.|$|E

500|$|As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's {{shift in}} favor of {{military}} intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called [...] "convening power" [...] to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state, and {{the wisdom of the}} intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.|$|E
2500|$|The Climate Change Science Program {{operated}} {{during an}} administration that believed that continued scientific investigation was necessary before policies should be implemented. [...] The CCSP faced the challenge of navigating the narrow path between administration officials who were sceptical of the general scientific consensus about greenhouse gases, and scientific critics who were skeptical about almost everything that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> related to climate change. [...] As a result, the CCSP was under more scrutiny than most federal scientific coordination programs.|$|E

Dershowitz later told the New York Times columnist William Safire that, [...] "when I first used the word, nobody knew what it meant." ...|$|E
5000|$|The White House {{threatened}} {{to veto the}} Senate version of the Act, arguing in an executive statement on November 17, 2011, that while [...] "the authorities granted by the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, including the detention authority...are essential to our ability to protect the American people...(and) Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not believe codification is necessary and poses some risk".|$|R
50|$|Part of the 50 reissued permits {{also include}} {{construction}} of natural gas, oil, and {{other fossil fuel}} pipelines.

Because of this controversy, <b>the</b> Obama <b>Administration</b> <b>did</b> not grant a real estate easement to the developers. This action by <b>the</b> Obama <b>Administration</b> <b>did</b> not stop <b>the</b> construction because the jurisdiction still falls under the Rivers and Harbors Act, which is overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|R

The original budget for CGI was $93.7 million, however this grew to $292 million prior to launch of the website. While estimates that the overall cost for building the website had reached over $500 million prior to launch, the Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.

2500|$|David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget {{director}} {{during his first}} administration {{and one of the}} early proponents of supply-side economics, was concerned that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not pay enough attention to cutting government spending. He maintained that the Laffer curve was not to be taken literally—at least not in the economic environment of the 1980s United States. In The Triumph of Politics, he writes: [...] "he whole California gang had taken [...] literally (and primitively). The way they talked, they seemed to expect that once the supply-side tax cut was in effect, additional revenue would start to fall, manna-like, from the heavens. Since January, I had been explaining that there is no literal Laffer curve." [...] Stockman also said that [...] "Laffer wasn't wrong, he just didn't go far enough" [...] (in paying attention to government spending).|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2007, President Bush held a {{press conference}} and was asked about his {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence.

Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since.

50|$|Among {{the cases}} {{in which there is}} a {{concurrence}} of causes, three types may be mentioned. First, when the victim has contributed in causing the damage, the compensation of <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> was reduced in equal proportion to the degree of intervention of the injured subject. If there is intentionality or gross negligence in the action of <b>the</b> victim, <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not have to compensate. In addition, full compensation is allowed for cases where the administrative action was notoriously disproportionate (a protest in which the riot police carried fire with the lethal ammunition).|$|R
50|$|For {{the sole}} {{proprietor}} {{there are a}} variety of options in obtaining financial support for their business, including loan facilities available from the U.S. Small Business <b>Administration.</b> <b>The</b> loans are not originated by the SBA, but <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> guarantee loans made by various independent lending institutions. The primary loan facility for small businesses offered by this agency is the 7(a) loan program, designed for general applications.

2500|$|Clinton {{testified to}} Congress in March that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not need congressional {{authorization}} for its {{military intervention in}} Libya or for further decisions about it, despite congressional objections from members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. During that classified briefing to Congress, she allegedly indicated that the administration would sidestep the Resolution's provision regarding a 60-day limit on unauthorized military actions. Months later, she stated that, {{with respect to the}} military operation in Libya, the United States was still flying a quarter of the sorties, and The New York Times reported that, while many presidents had bypassed other sections of the War Powers Resolution, there was little precedent for exceeding the 60-day statutory limit on unauthorized military actions – a limit which the Justice Department had said in 1980 was constitutional. The State Department publicly took the position in June 2011 that there was no [...] "hostility" [...] in Libya within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, contrary to legal interpretations by the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. The State Department requested (but never received) express Congressional authorization. The US House of Representatives voted to rebuke the administration for maintaining an American presence with the NATO operations in Libya, which they considered a violation of the War Powers Resolution.|$|E
2500|$|The USA PATRIOT Act, H.R. 3162, was {{introduced}} into the House on October 23. It incorporated H.R. 2975 and S. 1510 {{and many of the}} provisions of H.R. 3004 (the Financial Anti-Terrorism Act). Though there were some objections and concerns raised about the legislation, a motion was made to suspend the rules, and the bill was passed. Patrick Leahy in particular commented that [...] "our ability to make rapid progress [...] was impeded because the negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>did</b> not progress in a straight line. On several key issues that are of particular concern to me, we had reached an agreement with the Administration on Sunday, September 30. Unfortunately, over the next two days, the Administration announced that it was reneging on the deal. I appreciate the complex task of considering the concerns and missions of multiple Federal agencies, and that sometimes agreements must be modified as their implications are scrutinized by affected agencies. When agreements made by the Administration must be withdrawn and negotiations on resolved issues reopened, those in the Administration who blame the Congress for delay with what the New York Times described as [...] "scurrilous remarks," [...] do not help the process move forward." [...] The Act was opposed by only one vote, the sole dissenting Senator being Russ Feingold who found a number of measures objectionable or troubling. Feingold's concerns included the way that the bill was passed, aspects of the wiretapping provisions, the changes to search and seizure laws, the expanded powers under FISA that allowed law enforcement to gain access to business records and the changes to detention and deportation laws for immigrants. The Act had a number of [...] "sunsets" [...] included in it after insistence by Republican Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) However, the Act took into account any ongoing foreign intelligence investigations and allowed them to continue once the sections had expired.|$|E
