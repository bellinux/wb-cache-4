5|$|An {{ill-defined}} tropical wave {{entered the}} eastern Pacific on August1 and steadily organized <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> tropical depression intensity eight days later. Within {{an environment of}} light shear, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie at 0000UTC on August9 and continued to organize <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> Category1 hurricane intensity by 1200UTC the following day as an eye became apparent on satellite. Continuing westward and crossing into the central Pacific basin, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949mb (hPa; 28.03inHg) at 0000UTC on September12, while positioned roughly 980mi (1575km) east-southeast of the Big Island. Increased wind shear the next day caused Flossie to begin a slow weakening trend thereafter; at 1200UTC on September14, the system weakened to a Category2 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on September15, the cyclone was barely a Category1 hurricane. Six hours later, it weakened to a tropical storm as the low-level center became exposed on satellite. Flossie weakened to a tropical depression early on September16 and dissipated by 1800UTC.|$|E

5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> competence with a dao/saber, a month <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> competence with a qiang/spear, and a year <b>to</b> <b>attain</b> competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E
