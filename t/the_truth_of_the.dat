5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first thesis but rejecting strongly <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} claim that, {{independent of}} <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain {{wrote of the}} creature's existence in the early seventeenth century. However, no concrete evidence of such writings has been uncovered, even though Champlain did write of loud screams from sea monsters living in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{choosing}} impli-cations. Our method allows to compare two fuzzy implications. If <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antecedent and <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implication are given, {{by means of}} inverse fuzzy implications we can easily optimize <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implication consequent. Key words: fuzzy logic, fuzzy implications, inverted fuzzy implications...|$|R
5|$|The {{mention of}} those princes who were {{publicly}} {{supposed to be}} Christians, as we find it in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. l. vii c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his family; and forms a contemporary evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome, expresses himself with becoming diffidence concerning <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E

The flashy thief Kid and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido. Struggling to uncover his past and find the mysterious Frozen Flame, Serge is chiefly challenged by Lynx, a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him.|$|E

5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Described in the chronicles as a rash and temperamental man, Carrouges {{was also}} a fierce and brave warrior whose death in battle came after a forty-year {{military}} career in which he served in Normandy, Scotland and Hungary with distinction and success. He was also heavily involved in court politics, initially at {{the seat of his}} overlord Count Pierre of Alençon at Argentan, but later in the politics of the Royal household at Paris, to which he was attached as a chevalier d'honneur and Royal bodyguard in the years following the judicial duel. During his life he conducted a long trail of legal and financial dealings which infuriated his contemporaries and may have invited violence against himself and his family. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events which led him into public mortal combat in the Paris suburbs may never be known, but the legend is still debated and discussed 600 years later.|$|E
5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramopakhyana (the {{narrative}} of Rama in the epic Mahabharata), Sita informs Hanuman that Trijata brought her {{a message from}} Avindhya about the well-being of Rama, and that he and Lakshamana will soon come to rescue her from Lanka. Trijata thus assumes the role assigned to Kala in the original Ramayana. The Raghuvamsa, the Setubandha, the Balaramadasa Ramayana, the Kakawin Ramayana and the Seri Rama all replace Sarama with Trijata in the episode where <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illusory head of Rama is revealed to Sita. The Prasannaraghava has Trijata inform Sita about the burning of Lanka, instead of Sarama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana makes Trijata the saviour of Sita, when she stops Ravana from killing Sita in the Ashoka Vatika; this role was originally assigned to Mandodari. Trijata again saves Sita's life when a vengeful Ravana rushes to slay his captive after his son Indrajit is killed in the war. In the Ramayana, Suparshva – a minister of Ravana – stops him, while other adaptations attribute the act variously to Avindhya or Mandodari.|$|E
5|$|The {{bad feeling}} between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, {{the officer who}} coordinated the {{investigation}} from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 {{to write a book}} alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police pursued leads helpful to only the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira ("Maddie: <b>The</b> <b>Truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lie"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies, and was later translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{joined forces}} of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to Damietta on 27 October 1169, but the siege was {{unsuccessful}} {{due to the}} failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully. According to Byzantine forces, Amalric, not wanting to share the profits of victory, dragged out the operation until the emperor's men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine; Amalric then launched an assault, which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders. On the other hand, William of Tyre remarked that the Greeks were not entirely blameless. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegations of both sides, when the rains came, both the Latin army and the Byzantine fleet returned home, although half of the Byzantine fleet was lost in a sudden storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E
5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E

5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter, in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E
