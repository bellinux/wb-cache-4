2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie (As if {{unable to}} keep back the words). I didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> noticed my voice.|$|E
60|$|Such {{is the way}} {{the thing}} was done. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done the same under the circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>thee</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken thy {{death of}} cold," [...] said Mrs. Crowder, [...] "staying in that cold well the whole afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> {{told me when}} we were married: it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{a convenient}} weapon to break me in with.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] she said, [...] "my little {{visit to}} Paris {{was not so}} wild. I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> found out about Anne but for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are {{positively}} committed, then!' she said, much vexed. 'Oh, Philip! I did not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> married for mere beauty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a strawberry-bed. My {{father will}} give you some plants, and you can set them out this fall.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{sorry if}} {{the boys had}} brought me back with a bullet in me?" [...] he said, half-questioningly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} to hear it. Though if you had quite {{understood}} my whole meaning at first, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> refused. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would?' ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{discussing}} people's fear {{of death}} with Ronald Knox: [...] "One clings, and I can't <b>think</b> why. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought anyone <b>would</b> prefer heaven to fruit juice." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then at {{last she}} spoke. [...] "I did not <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> treated me in this way, Captain Aylmer! I did not expect that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> insult me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{if there}} had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor, you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been sure to have seen it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well;--that {{might come}} after a time. But I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{the feeling of}} the {{community}} with you if you succeeded;--well, not violence, you understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much difficulty,' said Harry, {{finding it}} much easier to answer for Linda than for her sister; 'but perhaps you don't admire her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I don't know it?" [...] he answered. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> had {{a bullet}} through your {{forehead}} before now if I {{was not sure}} of it?" ...|$|R
40|$|Club House, Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, circa 1907 - 1914. Postmark date: August [?]; Postcard number: 5155; Message included. Message reads: "You {{ought to}} have been here {{yesterday}} to boss the work. There was oceans of work and Kate went home Saturday night and didn't come back till this morning. I told you to stay till we went back. Aunt <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been right in your element yesterday. She has your blue sofa pillow top all done, and I will bring it back with me. Hastily Edna. ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Still,” said Nettie naively, “I didn’t <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{too many}} possessions, and, you see, there are {{limitations}} in the song. You might knock {{a long while}} at those ivory gates before they let you in.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure," [...] said Ellen, [...] "you {{have always}} been very kind to the children. But indeed, Caroline, I did not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{encouraged}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Frank {{laughed at}} this free-and-easy {{way of looking}} at it. [...] "So you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed him, do you, if I had not saved you the trouble?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If not,' said Cilla, 'it {{is because}} you are too {{innocent}} to know flirting when you see it! Dear Mrs. Prendergast, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> looked so grave.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome, Foy van Goorl," [...] {{said the}} man in a gentle voice. [...] "Many {{years have passed since}} last we met; still I should have known you anywhere, though I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> known me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} come to all the through trains since he say him yesterday. But I <b>think</b> even <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been suited, Mary, if you had seen his failure to walk off from the depot arm-in-arm with me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been comfortable, {{with the}} other two, Mrs. Holland. I don't know the colonel's wife, but Mrs. Larkins has {{travelled}} with us before, and I had quite enough of her on that voyage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a few little benches--rustic {{seats and}} that sort of thing. It might be so jolly to sit here, you know," [...] Lord Lambeth went on.|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (rising with marked stateliness). Your life in {{the camp}} has made you coarse, Sergius. I did not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{repeated}} such a story before me. (She turns away coldly.) ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{found her}} {{sister-in-law}} in the dining-room, and Mrs Mackenzie, of course, received {{her with a}} shower of tears. [...] "I did <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come, Margaret, by the first train." ...|$|E
6000|$|VENTIDIUS. Thank your kindness. [...] You said I loved you; and in recompense, [...] You bid me turn a traitor: Did I <b>think</b> [...] <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> used me thus?--that I {{should die}} [...] With a hard thought of you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doubtless great {{credit is}} due to her, Lieutenant Drummond; but you see, you had already {{defeated}} three, and I prefer to <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{got the better of}} the others, even if she had not come to your aid.|$|R
5000|$|... "If I Had Anything To Say (Don't <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> I <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> Said It All?)" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{says the}} other, 'I only knew you said so; I did not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> acted so from what I said, nor do I think I gave you any reason.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not sorry}} he escaped you, then," [...] said Bladud, with a laugh, [...] "though I {{scarcely}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed the poor lad {{even if you}} had caught him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{done better}} {{to leave the}} dwarf alone," [...] said Alan, [...] "and they might have left us alone. Now {{they will have a}} blood feud against us." ...|$|E
60|$|Our town {{is a quiet}} little town, {{and lies}} {{nestling}} in a little valley surrounded by pretty green hills. I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> heard our town mentioned had not the man lived there who was so wise that everyone marvelled at his great knowledge.|$|R
6000|$|... [Ironically.] Oh, you are clever! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Hilda <b>would</b> <b>have</b> climbed six {{flights of}} stairs unless Love had lent her wings? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{everything}} for that poor child; it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> completely justified {{her in her}} own eyes." ...|$|R
