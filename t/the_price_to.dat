5|$|The tyrant however, {{was able}} to persuade Vulso to reduce <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> 100 talents and promised to provide him with 1,000 medimni of wheat. Thus Moagĕtes managed to save his city. When the consul crossed the River Colobatus he was met by ambassadors {{from the town of}} Sinda in Pisidia. The ambassadors asked for {{assistance}} against the city of Termessus who had taken over all their country except for the capitol.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{is based}} on commercially {{available}} IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010. IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations, with a price in the millions of dollars, reflecting the $1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson. IBM expects <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves.|$|E

5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory {{promises to be a}} unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|While Marlborough {{achieved}} honours on the battlefield, the Whigs, {{now in the}} ascendancy, {{drove the}} remaining Tories from the Cabinet. Marlborough and Godolphin, now distanced from Anne, would henceforth have {{to conform to the}} decisions of a Whig ministry, while the Tories, sullen and vengeful, looked forward to their former leaders' downfall. To compound his troubles, the Duchess, spurred on by her hatred of Harley and Abigail, had finally driven the Queen to distraction and wrecked what was left of their friendship. Sarah was retained in her court position out of necessity as <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> be paid to keep her victorious husband {{at the head of the}} army.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E
