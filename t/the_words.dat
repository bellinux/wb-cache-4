5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words.

What <b>the</b> <b>words</b> stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> of a law must be understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be taken in another sense, or the rules of law dictate another interpretation. In all interpretations, however, the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of a new law. No words of a law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law <b>the</b> <b>words</b> must be considered in their context. When <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of a law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E
