5|$|The Stranges {{become a}} popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes is a relative. The Cabinet ministers find Strange {{easier to deal with}} than Norrell, and they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure George III's madness, {{although}} Strange manages to save the king from <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman,</b> the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E
5|$|The BBC has dramatised some of Hornung's Raffles {{stories for}} radio, {{first in the}} 1940s {{and again in the}} 1990s, when Nigel Havers played Raffles.

He made a further first-class appearance {{for the county}} in that year in the return fixture between the sides at the Royal Brunswick Ground, Hove. A journeyman first-class cricketer, Wynch turned out {{for a number of}} teams besides Sussex. In 1853, he played for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of England against <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of Kent, immediately following this game up with an appearance for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of England against <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> Marylebone Cricket Club, with both matches played at Lord's.

5|$|The Order {{has five}} officers: the Dean, the Chancellor, the Usher, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and the Secretary. The Dean is {{normally}} a cleric of the Church of Scotland. This office {{was not part}} of the original establishment, but was created in 1763 and joined to the office of Dean of the Chapel Royal. The two offices were separated in 1969. The office of Chancellor is mentioned and given custody of the seal of the Order in the 1687 statutes, but no-one was appointed to the position until 1913. The office has subsequently been held by one of the knights, though not necessarily the most senior. The Usher of the Order is <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> Usher of the Green Rod (unlike his Garter equivalent, <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> Usher of the Black Rod, he does not have another function assisting the House of Lords). The Lord Lyon King of Arms, head of the Scottish heraldic establishment and whose office predates his association with the Order serves as King of Arms of the Order. The Lord Lyon often—but not invariably—also serves as the Secretary.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} London, Mr Norrell {{encounters}} Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange, a young gentleman of property from Shropshire, and recites the same prophecy, which prompts Strange {{to become a}} magician. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's butler, and promises {{to make him a}} king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude. She rarely speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching their allegiance. Becoming aware of his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E

[...] The last recorded match on the ground came in 1961 when Nottinghamshire Juniors played Derbyshire Juniors.|$|R
5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which {{made it difficult for}} him to communicate, and he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, <b>The</b> <b>Gentleman</b> Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1860s to {{the early}} 1870s, W. S. Gilbert was {{extremely}} productive, writing a large quantity of comic verse, theatre reviews and other journalistic pieces, short stories, and dozens of plays and comic operas. His output in 1870 included dozens of his popular comic Bab Ballads; two blank verse comedies, The Princess and The Palace of Truth; two comic operas, Our Island Home and <b>The</b> <b>Gentleman</b> in Black; and various other short stories, comic pieces, and reviews appearing in various periodicals and newspapers. In 1871 he was even busier, producing seven plays and operas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: <b>The</b> <b>gentleman</b> who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{where the}} Buzzing {{in my head}} first began," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, {{following}} the new clew with the deepest attention and anxiety. [...] "I was employed to wait on <b>the</b> <b>gentlemen</b> at Darch's Dining-rooms--I was. <b>The</b> <b>gentlemen</b> all came together; <b>the</b> <b>gentlemen</b> were all hungry together; <b>the</b> <b>gentlemen</b> all gave their orders together--" [...] She stopped, and tapped her head again, despondently, with the tattered old book.|$|R
50|$|Deedes next {{first-class}} appearance came in 1827 for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> v Players player fixture, {{in which}} Deedes appeared in both <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> v Players fixtures for 1827, {{as well as}} representing Kent in a single first-class match against the Marylebone Cricket Club.|$|R

5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born a bastard. Jemima's mother died {{while she was still}} an infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later bound out as an apprentice to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is thrown out of the house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Under the Hanoverian kings {{certain of}} the {{officers}} also held heraldic office. The office of Blanc Coursier Herald of Arms was attached {{to that of the}} Genealogist, Brunswick Herald of Arms to <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> Usher, and Bath King of Arms was also made Gloucester King of Arms with heraldic jurisdiction over Wales. This {{was the result of a}} move by Anstis to give the holders of these sinecures greater security; the offices of the Order of the Bath were held at the pleasure of the Great Master, while appointments to the heraldic offices were made by the King under the Great Seal and were for life.|$|E
5|$|Childermass {{meanwhile}} eventually {{receives the}} message meant {{for him by}} Strange and uses it to break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> with the thistledown hair intends to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England {{to pay homage to}} John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the 'nameless slave'. However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen. He uses his momentary control of England to destroy the man with the thistledown hair, before Stephen, travelling through one of the newly opened Faerie roads, becomes the new king of the now blossoming Lost-Hope.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> {{appeared}} in first-class cricket between 1806 and 1962, always in <b>the</b> showcase <b>Gentlemen</b> v Players matches against the Players. Teams called <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> {{have played in}} a few minor matches.|$|R

5|$|Hesketh-Prichard was {{a talented}} cricketer, and played {{for a number}} of teams, {{including}} Hampshire, London County, and Marylebone Cricket Club. A right-arm fast bowler, he made his début in the first class game when he played for Hampshire against Somerset in the 1900 County Championship. He was not however a strong batsman, and would typically play in the tail of the batting order. He joined the short-lived London County in 1902, where he was a teammate of W. G. Grace. In 1903 he played his first of several games for The Gentlemen v The Players at Lords. He would be selected for <b>The</b> <b>Gentleman</b> three years in succession. In 1904, he joined the MCC, and took part in Lord Brackley's XI's tour of the West Indies in the 1904/5 season. In 1907, he toured the United States with the MCC.|$|E
5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{travels to}} Venice and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond {{of each other}} and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with {{dangerous}} magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost Hope. <b>The</b> <b>gentleman</b> with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice {{to find out more about}} Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him. Strange instructs Drawlight to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances that exist in England between the forces of nature and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.|$|E
25|$|His next {{appearance}} in first-class cricket didn't come until 1859, {{when he played}} for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Surrey Club at The Oval. He made further first-class appearances in 1859, for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> South against <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> North, {{as well as for}} the Surrey Club against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He also made two appearances for Sussex, both against Kent. The following year he made three appearances in first-class cricket, for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Cambridge University at Fenner's, for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> against <b>the</b> Players and for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> South against <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> North. In 1861, he played two matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Cambridge University and Sussex, as well as a single match for <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> South against <b>the</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> of <b>the</b> North.
