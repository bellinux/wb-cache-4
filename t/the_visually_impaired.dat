5|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was refurbished by Metronet during 2005 and 2006. Works included provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired,</b> installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Etherington {{has only}} five percent vision in both eyes and competes in <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> category.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present accessories, {{techniques}} and systems which enable <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> {{to move in}} urban traffic. <b>The</b> blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> participate in traffic as pedestrians, passengers in cars and in means of public transport etc. This thesis is therefore designed so that it covers all these fields. The survey {{at the end of}} the thesis presents the needs and thoughts of <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> as well as the views of those who can see on the involvement of <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> in traffic. A special emphasis is on planning and designing of an open space for <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> as well as on the importance of proper selection of materials, colours and techniques during the planning. The examples of practice include a presentation of a few points for <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> in Ljubljana which are more or less successfully placed in the environment...|$|R

In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers {{on how to deal}} with children with learning disabilities.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E
