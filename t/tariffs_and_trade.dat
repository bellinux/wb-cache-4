5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade</b> (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-French {{businessman}} James Goldsmith {{announced the}} formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement on <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade,</b> believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E

5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General Agreement on <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade</b> and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade</b> (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

50|$|As {{globalization}} integrates {{the economies}} of neighboring <b>and</b> of <b>trading</b> states, they are typically forced to trade off such rules {{as part of a}} common tax, <b>tariff</b> <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> regime, e.g. as defined by a free trade pact.

25|$|An import or {{export tariff}} (also called customs duty or impost) is a charge for the {{movement}} of goods through a political border. <b>Tariffs</b> discourage <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> they may be used by governments to protect domestic industries. A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay government to maintain a navy or border police. The classic ways of cheating a tariff are smuggling or declaring a false value of goods. Tax, <b>tariff</b> <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on industrial policy, investment policy, and agricultural policy. A trade bloc {{is a group of}} allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other, and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc. A customs union has a common external <b>tariff,</b> <b>and</b> the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union.|$|R
50|$|Another example {{problem of}} this nature is {{agricultural}} subsidies to domestic farmers. A nation abolishing such subsidies stands to lose much of its family farm infrastructure to cheap imports unless a simultaneous initiative in another country, or in tax, <b>tariff</b> <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> {{to make up for}} lost subsidies, takes place. As this example suggests, the policies that are put in place simultaneously may be more complex than initially realized, and may require the cooperation of multiple branches or levels of government within one country, in addition to global cooperation.|$|R
