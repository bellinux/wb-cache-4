5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is shrouded in obscurity for decades. But <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Although {{short fiction}} had been popular {{as far back}} as the Tang dynasty (618–907), and the works of {{contemporaneous}} authors such as Xu Guangqi, Xu Xiake, and Song Yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic, the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel. While the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of Classical Chinese, those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families, merchants, and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed Vernacular Chinese. Literati scholars edited or developed major Chinese novels into mature form in this period, such as Water Margin and Journey to the West. Jin Ping Mei, published in 1610, although incorporating earlier material, marks <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> independent composition and concern with psychology. In the later years of the dynasty, Feng Menglong and Ling Mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction. Theater scripts were equally imaginative. The most famous, The Peony Pavilion, was written by Tang Xianzu (1550–1616), with its first performance at the Pavilion of Prince Teng in 1598.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Chadwick {{carried out}} {{research}} {{as part of}} the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> Big Science, Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.|$|E
5|$|While moving near Rodrigues, Bella {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} 210km/h (130mph), along with high tides that flooded the northern coastline, including the capital Port Mathurin. The storm damaged 1,200homes and destroyed 300others, leaving about 1,000people homeless. About 30schools were wrecked. The storm damaged about 75% of the electrical network was damaged, which also disrupted water supply on the island, and about 30% of roads were damaged. Over 90% of the cropson the island were destroyed, with many livestock killed. Cyclone Bella killed {{about half of}} the Rodrigues flying fox, a critically endangered species, decreasing the numbers from around 800 to around 400. The species had regrown from a minimum of around 70 in 1971, and <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> regrowth continued after the storm, reaching about 3,500 in 2002. The storm also affected the Rodrigues warbler. The storm also injured nine people, and overall, Bella was considered the worst storm on the island in 20years.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history. For Virginia Tech, coverage focused on the Hokies' winless history in BCS games since 1995, as Tech had lost all four of its appearances in a BCS game since an upset win over Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Also mentioned was the fact that the two teams had faced each other in the 1947 Sun Bowl, which had been each school's first bowl game. The low win rate of ACC teams in general was another point of interest. Teams from the conference had won just one of their ten appearances in a BCS bowl before the Orange Bowl. Before the Orange Bowl matchup, the two teams last played in 2006, when the Hokies defeated the Bearcats, 29–13, at Virginia Tech's home field, Lane Stadium. For the Orange Bowl, spread bettors favored a reversal of that 2006 final, as Cincinnati was initially favored by one point. This expanded to 1.5 points by December 9. <b>The</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> Cincinnati continued, and on December 27, betting organizations gave Cincinnati the edge by two or two and a half points.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> {{artificial}} ice was hastened by {{the regular}} ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E

40|$|The water {{resources}} of the western U. S. depend heavily on snowpack to store part of wintertime precipitation into the drier summer months. A well-documented shift towards earlier runoff in recent decades {{has been attributed to}} 1) more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow, and 2) earlier snowmelt. The present study addresses the former, documenting a regional <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> smaller ratios of winter-total snowfall water equivalent (SFE) to winter-total precipitation (P) during the period 1949 - 2004. <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> <b>toward</b> reduced SFE are a response to warming across the region, with the most significant reductions occurring where winter wet-day minimum temperatures, averaged over the study period, were warmer than- 5 ºC. Most SFE reductions were associated with winter wet-day temperature increases between 0 and + 3 °C over the study period. Warmings larger than this occurred mainly at sites where the mean temperatures were cool enough that precipitation form was less susceptible to warming <b>trends.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> <b>toward</b> reduced SFE/P were most pronounced in March regionwide and in January near the West Coast, corresponding to widespread warming in these months...|$|R

We hypothesized that people with higher trait exploration experience a greater increase in lifestyle options and learning opportunities––but more so in social ecologies in which individualization and lifelong learning are stronger, thus offering greater latitude for exploring the benefits of these trends. We employed structural equation modeling in two parallel adult samples from Germany (N[*]=[*] 2, 448) and Poland (N[*]=[*] 2, 571), using regional divorce rates as a proxy for individualization and Internet domain registration rates as a proxy for lifelong learning. Higher exploration was related to a greater perceived increase in lifestyle options and in learning opportunities over the past 5 years. These associations were stronger in regions in which <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>toward</b> individualization and lifelong learning, respectively, were more prominent. Individuals higher in exploration are better equipped to reap the benefits of current social change––but the effects of exploration are bounded by the conditions in the social ecology...|$|R
