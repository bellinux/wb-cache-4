50|$|<b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> (THP) {{and other}} {{antiparkinsonian}} drugs {{are known to}} be substances of abuse. This is true both in abusers of other substances and in chronic schizophrenics, the latter being infrequent abusers of other drugs. <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> mimics an atropine intoxication with mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic states of bowels and bladder, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is physostigmine which combines a peripheral and a central action. Carbachol can be used to treat atonic bowel and bladder. The vital functions should be monitored and stabilized. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets. Clinical case reports have repeatedly shown overdose of <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> alongside other substances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> is {{used for}} the {{symptomatic}} treatment of Parkinson's disease in mono and combination therapy. It is active in postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic forms. The drug is also commonly used to treat extrapyramidal side effects occurring during antipsychotic treatment. It reduces the frequency and duration of oculogyric crises as well as of dyskinetic movements and spastic contractions. <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> may improve psychotic depression and mental inertia frequently associated with Parkinson's disease and symptomatic problems caused by antipsychotic treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> (Artane, Apo-Trihex, Parkin, Pacitane), {{also known}} as benzhexol, Ariane, and trihex, is an {{antiparkinsonian}} agent of the antimuscarinic class. It has been in clinical usage for decades.|$|E
50|$|Acetophenone is {{used for}} the {{synthesis}} of many pharmaceuticals, for example: pyrrobutamine, dextropropoxyphene, <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> pridinol, aspaminol, Cycrimine, Biperiden, Procyclidine, acifran, Amixetrine, Mesuximide, and Benmoxin.Allegedly also for phenylpropanolamine (note: in this case it is actually propiophenone not PhAc).|$|E
50|$|Dystonic {{reactions}} may {{be treated}} with benzatropine, diphenhydramine, <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> or procyclidine. Symptoms usually subside with diphenhydramine injected intramuscularly. Agents in the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be helpful, but benefits are usually modest and side effects of sedation and weakness can be problematic.|$|E
5000|$|People {{should allow}} a period {{to adjust to}} the dose when first {{starting}} <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> and when the dose has been increased or added to a regimen with other drugs because acute somnolence and accumulated fatigue can make it particularly dangerous to operate an automobile, heavy machinery etc.|$|E
50|$|For the {{treatment}} of genitourinary autonomic neuropathy medications may include sildenafil (a guanine monophosphate type-5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor). For {{the treatment}} of hyperhidrosis, anticholinergic agents such as <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> or scopolamine can be used, also intracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin type A {{can be used for}} management in some cases.|$|E
50|$|Commonly used {{medications}} for EPS are anticholinergic agents such as benztropine (Cogentin), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> (Artane). Another common {{course of treatment}} includes dopamine agonist agents such as pramipexole. These medications reverse the symptoms of extrapyramidal side effects caused by antipsychotics or other drugs that {{either directly or indirectly}} inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of action in parkinsonian syndromes is not precisely understood, but {{it is known that}} <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> blocks efferent impulses in parasympathetically innervated structures like smooth muscles (spasmolytic activity), salivary glands, and eyes (mydriasis). In higher doses direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may contribute. In very high doses central toxicity as seen in atropine overdose is noted. It binds to the M1 muscarinic receptor and possibly the dopamine receptor. <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of action is within 1 hour after oral dosing. The peak activity is noted after 2 to 3 hours. The duration of action of one single dose is 6 to 12 hours in a dose dependent manner. It is excreted in the urine, probably as unchanged drug. More precise data in animals and humans have so far not been determined.|$|E
50|$|But the {{medication}} Leigh was prescribed (<b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> hydrochloride, {{formerly known as}} Artane) did actually work - only about 1 in 10 sufferers can tolerate this medicine, and the chances of it having a long term positive effect are very slight. Throughout the 1990s he slowly regained sufficient control of the condition to resume work.|$|E
50|$|Procyclidine, 1-cyclohexyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrrolidinopropan-1-ol, is {{synthesized}} {{in exactly}} the same manner as was seen for <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> except this time the linear synthesis begins with the preparation of 3-(1-pyrrolidino)propiophenone.In an interesting variation, the ketone is first reacted with phenylmagnesium bromide. Catalytic hydrogenation of the carbinol thus obtained can be stopped after the reduction of only one aromatic ring.|$|E
50|$|Botulinum toxin {{injected}} into the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle {{has been shown to}} be beneficial in some cases associated with orbicularis oculi contraction or blepharospasm. Levodopa has been reported to improve symptoms in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. There have also been reports of improvement with <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> and valproic acid. Surgical treatment may be considered in severe cases or cases that occur with blepharospasm.|$|E
50|$|Other {{medications}} {{may be used}} to {{help reduce}} fatigue, ease muscle cramps, control spasticity, and reduce excess saliva and phlegm. Drugs also are available to help people with pain, depression, sleep disturbances, dysphagia, and constipation. Baclofen and diazepam are often prescribed to control the spasticity caused by ALS, and <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> or amitriptyline may be prescribed when people with ALS begin having trouble swallowing their saliva.|$|E
50|$|In large doses, {{atropine}} sulfate helped control the involuntary movements associated with klazomania in one patient; attempts to treat {{with a combination}} of phenobarbital and <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> (also known as Artane) were also made. Phenobarbital acts as an anticonvulsant and is generally used to treat seizures, while Artane is used to treat involuntary movements in Parkinson's disease; however, this combination was found to have no beneficial effect in treating klazomania. Klazomania does not respond to anti-epileptic medications.|$|E
50|$|The drug cannot cure Parkinson's disease, but {{may provide}} {{substantial}} alleviation of symptoms.An estimated 50 to 75% {{of people with}} Parkinson's disease will react positively and experience a 20 to 30% symptomatic improvement. To increase therapeutic activity <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> is often given concomitantly with levodopa, other antimuscarinic or antihistaminic (e.g. diphenhydramine) agents. Combination treatment with dopaminergic agonists such as cabergoline is also possible. This is often termed a 'multidimensional approach'. It has also been prescribed for essential tremor and akathisia.|$|E
50|$|Artane, or its generic form <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> HCL, was {{approved}} by the FDA on June 25th, 2003 for the clinical use of all types of parkinsonism.However, it has been clinically relevant in trials pertaining to Parkinson's disease since 1949. Artane is an anticholinergic drug which is prescribed by doctors throughout the world. It is also abused, typically in combination with other drugs or delicate pharmaceutical agents. Prisons in Iraq were among the places where abuse was obvious, along with within communities of Iraqi soldiers.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} be useful in pain control for neuropathic pain treated with opioids as it {{increases}} the level of analgesia obtained. Several mechanisms are thought to contribute to this effect. The closely related drugs atropine and scopolamine {{and other members of}} the anticholinergic drug group like cyclobenzaprine, <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> and orphenadrine are also used for this purpose. When hyoscyamine is used along with opioids or other anti-peristaltic agents, measures to prevent constipation are especially important given the risk of paralytic ileus.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include {{dry mouth}} and throat, eye pain, blurred vision, restlessness, dizziness, arrhythmia, flushing, and faintness. An {{overdose}} will cause headache, nausea, vomiting, and {{central nervous system}} symptoms including disorientation, hallucinations, euphoria, sexual arousal, short-term memory loss, and possible coma in extreme cases. The euphoric and sexual effects are stronger than those of atropine but weaker than those of scopolamine, as well as dicycloverine, orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> and ethanolamine antihistamines like phenyltoloxamine. It can also act as a diuretic.|$|E
50|$|Organic {{and toxic}} syndromes can also induce tactile hallucinations. The use of cocaine for {{recreational}} purposes {{has been reported}} to induce tactile hallucinations. They usually have sensations of moving itches and crawling insects. Cocaine and alcohol can induce rapid firing of neuronal cells of the somatosensory region of the brain leading to vivid perception of illusionary bugs on the skin. Additionally, as mentioned above, <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> is an antiparkinsonian drug that creates tactile hallucination. The mechanism through which these drugs induce tactile hallucinations is still unknown.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 news report, <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> {{was seen}} {{to be used for}} {{recreational}} purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, among other prescription drugs. The report states that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress. Although that may be the case for some, others used Artane as a substitute or more intense version of LSD. This was especially prevalent in the 1960's, {{according to a report in}} [...] "The New Yorker". Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence.|$|E
50|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{is another}} form of neuroenhancement. Unlike tDCS, though, DBS involves the implantation of a medical device, and is restricted for use for only a few, severe diseases such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. In one study, DBS improved movement by 39%, reduced disability by 38%, and improved quality of life by 30% for patients suffering from dystonia over a course of 3 months. The patients had a reduction in dystonia symptoms by 50%. Improvement was noticeable within hours to days after DBS application. The benefits of DBS as of now are far more than those of high-dosage <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> a powerful drug used in the treatment for dystonia.|$|E
5000|$|About 7% of {{individuals}} with Parkinson's disease also experience mild or severe types of tactile hallucinations. [...] Most of these hallucinations {{are based on the}} sensation of a particular kind of animal. Several case studies were conducted by FÃ©nelon and his colleagues on parkinson's patients that had tactile hallucinations. One of his patients described that he sensed [...] "spiders and cockroaches chewing on his lower limb" [...] which was rather painful. Several other patients felt that there was a parasitic infestation of their skin which caused lesions on their skins due to the obsessive need of itching. FÃ©nelon also analyzed the particular types of tactile hallucinations experienced, the timing of such experience and certain drugs that could eliminate such experience. It was concluded that patients with both Parkinson's disease and tactile hallucinations not only experienced sensations elicited by insects under their skin but also by vivid tactile sensations of people. These hallucinations were aggravated during evening times due to altered arousal states and were alleviated by dopaminergic treatment such as the intake of clozapine. The study also explains that the pathophysiology of tactile hallucinations is uncertain, however, such hallucinations can be attributed to narcoleptic rapid eye movement sleep disorders due to its concordance with visual hallucinations. Moreover, it emphasizes that individuals who have had Parkinson's {{for a longer period of}} time have a more severe form of tactile hallucinations than with individuals who have succumbed to this disease for just a short period of time.Clinical drugs used as an antiparkinsonian agent such as <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> are known to create tactile hallucinations in parkinson patients.|$|E

40|$|The {{selectivity}} {{profiles of}} the muscarinic receptor antagonists dicyclomine and <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> have been examined in binding and functional studies and {{compared with those of}} pirenzepine and atropine. Dicyclomine, <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> and pirenzepine demonstrated the highest affinity for the M 1 muscarinic receptor subtype as revealed in competition experiments against [3 H]-pirenzepine labelling of cortical membranes. Their affinity values lay in a narrow range (3. 7 - 14 nM) approaching that of atropine (1. 6 nM). Competition experiments against [3 H]-N-methylscopolamine in cardiac and glandular (salivary) membranes revealed differences between the drugs examined. Dicyclomine, <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> and pirenzepine displayed low affinity for the cardiac and intermediate affinity for the glandular receptors. Thus, the drugs appeared to discriminate between the M 1 (cortical) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). However, atropine displayed similar affinities for either subtype with IC 50 s varying only slightly (1. 6 - 4. 6 nM). The rank order of selectivity was: pirenzepine greater than dicyclomine greater than <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> greater than atropine. Mirroring the binding data, pirenzepine, dicyclomine and <b>trihexyphenidyl</b> showed a tenfold greater ability at inhibiting M 1 -receptor mediated ganglionic responses (McN A- 343 pressor effect in pithed rats and nictitating membrane contraction in cats) than at inhibiting peripheral muscarinic responses in the heart and cardiovascular smooth muscle (vagal bradycardia in rats and cats and vagally-induced vasodilatation in cats). The muscarinic antagonists so far examined can be categorized into two groups. <b>Trihexyphenidyl,</b> dicyclomine and pirenzepine, included in one group, are characterized by a higher affinity for the neuronal (M 1) muscarinic receptor, hence they antagonize functional responses mediated by the M 1 subtype.

Ther. 197 : 135 - 141, 1976. <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> and benztropine have potent local {{anesthetic}} {{action on}} squid axon membranes. They suppress the peak transient sodium conductance with EDSO values equal to 1. 75 x 10 -i and 0. 78 x 1 O M, respectively, and shift the sodium conductance curve along the potential axis {{in the direction}} of depolarization by 2. 3 and 8. 7 mV, respectively. The time for the sodium current to attain its peak is shortened. Steady-state potassium conductance is also suppressed by these drugs and undergoes an inactivation which has a potential-dependence characteristic. The local anesthetic action combined with the anticholinergic action may warrant further study of these two drugs, especially <b>trihexyphenidyl,</b> as a potential antiarrhythmic agent. <b>Trihexyphenidyl,</b> benztropine, caramiphen and ethopropazine, commonly used in the symptomatic relief of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, have been reported to block the action potential of the squid giant axon (Rosenberg and Bartels, 1967). <b>Trihexyphenidyl</b> and benztropine have also been shown to exert depressive actions on the cardiac tissue.
