500|$|More than 750 {{slaves were}} rescued in the Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", {{and she was}} praised for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the thunder, and that was the big guns; and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali Mansour Ahmed Khudair was a 53 or 58-year-old Bahraini {{who died}} on 17February after police shot at his back. He had 91 pellets in his chest. Khudair was a {{fisherman}} from Sitra {{who lived in a}} ramshackle house. He had three sons: Hassan (21), Jaffar (14) and Ahmed (9), as well as an 18-year-old daughter. Jaffar said: [...] "I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, when I woke up, I started moving away, but my father told me to endure, stay and not fear. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> screams and rushed there. For a few seconds he spoke to the security forces, asking them to stay away from women and children, but they shot him in the chest. He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The Marines {{carried the}} corpse below. Then the bugle {{give us some}} more 'Dead March,' <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>'eard</b> a splash from a bow six-pounder port, an' the bugle struck up a cheerful tune.

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Marais in {{a curious}} voice. [...] "The truth is, Allan, that Hernan Pereira left us about a {{fortnight}} before you came. One horse remained, which was his, and with two Hottentots, who were also his servants, he rode back upon the track by which we came, {{to try to find}} help. Since <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> nothing of him." ...|$|R
60|$|Sundry Buyers {{pressed his}} abdomen gingerly and hesitated, while Nancy, his face one dogged, long-suffering bleakness, reluctantly entered the forecastle. <b>Then,</b> from inside, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> oaths, vile and filthy, urgings and expostulations {{on the part}} of Nancy, meekly and pleadingly uttered.|$|R
6000|$|True again. The {{step was}} coming toward us--straight toward the hut. It {{must be a}} beast, then, and {{we might as well}} have saved our trepidation. I was going to step out, but the king laid his hand upon my arm. There was a moment of silence, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a soft knock on the cabin door. It made me shiver. Presently the knock was repeated, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> these words in a guarded voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the tramp of men {{coming to}} the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say: ...|$|E
60|$|The king hesitated, {{was going}} to demur; but just <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the door give way, and knew that those desolate men were in the {{presence}} of their dead.|$|E
5000|$|One of the survivors, Zarfa Turkovic, {{described}} {{the horrors of}} rapes as follows: [...] "Two soldiers took her legs and raised {{them up in the}} air, while the third began raping her. Four of them were taking turns on her. People were silent, no one moved. She was screaming and yelling and begging them to stop. They put a rag into her mouth and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> just <b>heard</b> silent sobs...." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sarsby nodded. [...] "Yes, sir!" [...] he said,--"Richard Sinclair. He was her father's brother, you see,--a queer, {{wandering}} sort of fish. However, {{he certainly}} did write the girl, a few weeks ago, {{saying that he was}} back in England, and hoped to realize a large sum of money on some of his investments, and promised to send for her to come up to town. Since <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> nothing from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had heard}} of your escape before your letter came to us from Paris. Our city constables brought back the news of how you had jumped overboard, and had been pulled into a boat and disappeared. And finely they were laughed at when they told their tale. Then came your letter {{saying that it was}} Malcolm who had met you with the boat, and how you had sailed away and been wrecked on the coast of France; but since <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|The riot {{from below}} ceased at length, and was {{followed}} by a new voice, speaking quietly and emphatically, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the doctor's step again upon the stairs.|$|E
60|$|An {{instant of}} silence followed, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the light {{fall of the}} {{footsteps}} again, fainter and fainter--sinking away into the darkness--sinking, sinking, sinking--till they {{were lost in the}} silence.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was quite}} a respectable roar of battle that rolled among the {{hillocks}} for ten minutes, always out of our sight. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the [...] "Cease Fire" [...] over the ridge.|$|E
6000|$|George wrote very affectionately to tell me; and dear, admirable Arabel sent a {{note the}} very next day to prove to Ba that there was nothing to fear on her account. Since <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> nothing. The funeral was to take place in Herefordshire. We had just made up our minds to go on no account to England this year. Ba felt the {{restraint}} on her too horrible to bear. I will, or she will, no doubt, write and tell you of herself; and you must write, dear Mrs. Martin, will you not? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{touched off}} a green three-pounder which rose several {{thousand}} metres, and burst into gorgeous stars. [...] "Reproduce the manoeuvre," [...] he says, [...] "at the other end o' this ridge--if it don't end in another cliff." [...] So we steamed down the ridge {{a mile and a}} half east, and then I let Jules touch off a pink rocket, or he'd ha' kissed me. That was his only way to express his emotions, so to speak. Their heads come up then all around us to the extent o' thousands. We hears bugles like cocks crowing below, and on the top of it a most impressive sound which I'd never enjoyed before because 'itherto I'd always been an inteegral part of it, so to say--the noise of 'ole armies gettin' under arms. They must 'ave anticipated a night attack, I imagine. Most impressive. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>'eard</b> a threshin'-machine. [...] "Tutt! Tutt! This is childish!" [...] says Lootenant Morshed. [...] "We can't wait till they've finished cutting chaff for their horses. We must make 'em understand we're not to be trifled with. Expedite 'em with another rocket, Mr. Pyecroft." ...|$|R
60|$|He tied them in {{a little}} log pen near the cabin and whipped them soundly. And the next few days, while Wallace and I rested, he took them out {{separately}} and deliberately ran them over coyote and deer trails. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> his stentorian yell as a forerunner to the blast from his old shotgun. <b>Then</b> again <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the shots unheralded by the yell. Wallace and I waxed warm under the collar over this peculiar method of training dogs, and each of us made dire threats. But in justice to their implacable trainer, the dogs never appeared to be hurt; never a spot of blood flecked their glossy coats, nor did they ever come home limping. Sounder grew wise, and Don gave up, but Moze appeared not to change.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{our father}} wishing the other gentlemen good- night, {{and to our}} {{surprise}} Clarence opened the door, though he was deadly white and with dew starting on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|I stepped by him quickly. He {{was a small}} man, but {{he seized}} me pluckily by the collar. Just <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a door open, and my cousin stepped out dressed for the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Things creep out. He {{had made}} himself disagreeable to his lordship for some months past; and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{that he was}} talking of Appleslocombe {{as though he were}} certain to be sent there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cartwright {{recalled}} [...] "I absolutely hated {{dance music}} ... But Rupert {{took me to}} a rave, and that was it for me. I'd always thought that dance music was so minimalist and easy, but when you get into it it's actually quite intricate and complex. I loved that. And <b>then</b> when <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> what Underworld were doing with vocals, we wanted to do that, too." [...] In 1995 Sonic Animation released their debut single, [...] "Time Is an Illusion", on a self-funded independent label. They followed with three extended plays, From Sand to Stars (1995), Zero Zero Zero Zero One (1995) and Force Feed (May 1997).|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{her in the}} distance. Very faint {{at first}} were the birr of wheels and the tat-tat-tat of the horses' feet. Then they grew louder and clearer and louder yet, until a pair of yellow lanterns swung round the curve, and in their light we saw the two big brown horses tearing along the high, blue carriage {{at the back of}} them. The postilion pulled them up panting and foaming within a few yards of us. In a moment we were at the window and had raised our hands in a salute to the beautiful pale face which looked out at us.|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't {{want one}} of 'em; but the Continent used to point out, every time {{relations}} were strained, that nothing would be easier than to raid England if they got command of the sea for a week. After a few years some genius discovered that it cut both ways, an' {{there was no reason}} why we, who are supposed to command the sea and own a few ships, should not organise our little raids in case of need. The notion caught on among the Volunteers--they were getting rather sick of manoeuvres on dry land--and since <b>then</b> <b>we</b> haven't <b>heard</b> so much about raids from the Continent," [...] said Bayley.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a splash, {{and a great}} struggle. Another {{minute and}} he had grabbed at and caught Sir Henry's outstretched hand, and we had pulled him up high and dry into the tunnel.|$|E
6000|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{a prodigious}} barking, {{and a dozen}} hounds came {{charging}} down the path at our horses' legs, the roan shying into the truck patch. A man's voice, deep, clear, compelling, was heard calling:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{a couple}} of terrible screams, and then another not so loud, and then another that was 'way below, and you could only JUST hear it; and I heard Jim say, [...] "Po' Mars Tom!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no; I wouldn't sleep {{there for}} thousands! Not that I attach any {{importance}} to such folly,--my poor dear uncle would never hear {{of such a}} thing; but I am such a nervous creature, I should lie awake all night expecting the rats to run over me. I never knew of any one sleeping there, except in the gay times when I was a child, and the house used to be as full as, or fuller than, it could hold, for the hunt breakfast or a ball, and my poor aunt used to make up ever so many beds in the two rooms, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> never <b>heard</b> of any disturbance, except what they made themselves.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had been}} {{following}} up the blow in Kinkel's[9] favour, and I was growing sanguine, {{in the hope of}} getting him out (having enlisted strong and active sympathy in his behalf), when the news came of his escape. Since <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> nothing of him. I rather incline to the opinion that the damnable powers that be connived at his escape, but know nothing. Whether he be retaken or whether he appear (as I am not without hope he may) in the streets of London, I shall be a party to no step whatever without consulting you; and if any scrap of intelligence concerning him shall reach me, it shall be yours immediately.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Dyer {{claimed to}} have killed a Bigfoot-like {{creature}} in San Antonio, Texas, in early September. According to Dyer, he lured the Bigfoot out using [...] "pork ribs from Wal-Mart" [...] doused in a special barbecue sauce that he attached to trees. Of the experience, he told Esquire magazine, [...] "We nailed 'em all around the trees, and <b>then</b> that night <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> Bigfoot come back. I chased him {{down in the middle}} of the night. I shot him once, he ran, I shot him again." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the far clank of chains, and {{presently}} Joan entered {{with her}} keepers {{and took her}} seat upon her isolated bench. She was looking well now, and most fair and beautiful after her fortnight's rest from wordy persecution.|$|E
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a kind Of war-whoop, such as David {{might have}} emitted when he knocked out the {{champion}} Goliath. It was a sling that Red Chief had {{pulled out of}} his pocket, and he was whirling it around his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} bad as that," [...] Babbie answered, {{and told}} him what had brought her to Thrums. [...] "I had no thought but of {{returning}} to you, nor he of keeping me from you. We had said good-by at the mudhouse door--and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> your voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR PETER:--Oh, how glad I am {{that you}} are getting better! Those days when we thought you wouldn't were the hardest of my whole life. It seemed too dreadful to be true that perhaps you would die. And <b>then</b> when <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{you were going to}} get better that seemed too good to be true. Oh, Peter, hurry up and get well, for we are having such good times and we miss you so much. I have coaxed Uncle Alec not to burn his potato stalks till you are well, because I {{remember}} how you always liked to see the potato stalks burn. Uncle Alec consented, though Aunt Janet said it was high time they were burned. Uncle Roger burned his last night and it was such fun.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth, however, {{resisted}} in the corridor. I {{heard her}} say “Pourquoi?” and I heard a voice as I recognized as the doctor who was in civilian clothes say “Pour typhus”. <b>We</b> <b>then</b> <b>heard</b> the noise of a struggle and the muffled cries of the woman. I assumed that someone held {{a hand over her}} mouth. I heard the woman being dragged away too. She was groaning louder than the others.|$|R
500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think {{it took us a}} while to find it but I think we found the right song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] to be something that people didn't expect and <b>then</b> when <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|R
