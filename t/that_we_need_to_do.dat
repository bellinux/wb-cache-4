Also underlined that the nazi persecution of homosexuals mostly was silenced in Belarus from Soviet times till now, also said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a lot of work to reveal the names of this heroes and obstacles of their death and hope that holding the actions like this will initiate Belarusian LGBT movement activists to work more hard for it.|$|E
5000|$|Palaszczuk {{faced the}} task of {{rebuilding}} a party which had just suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in Queensland history, and amongst the worst that a governing party has ever suffered {{at the state level}} in Australia. She also faced the difficulty of leading an opposition caucus of only seven members, two short of official status (though Newman subsequently promised that Labor would have the full rights and resources entitled to the official opposition). After taking the leadership, Palaszczuk said, [...] "We need to make ourselves relevant to voters. We {{need to get back to}} our basics. Workers' rights, protecting the environment, investment in education—these are core Labor principles and somewhere along the way we simply lost our way." [...] She also said, [...] "I'm under no illusion of the task ahead, of the rebuild <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and the fact that we need to restore people's faith in the Queensland Labor Party".|$|E
5000|$|Casting Crowns' frontman, Mark Hall wrote [...] "Jesus, Friend of Sinners" [...] {{to address}} {{the idea that the}} world knows those who follow the Christian faith more for what they oppose than what they support; he stated that the song is a [...] "reminder <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} about that". He also commented that, despite the use of [...] "strong words" [...] in the song to grab attention, the true focus of the song is the chorus, which calls the church to be more aware of the world and to let their hearts be [...] "led by mercy". While Hall noted the song was [...] "one of the more direct songs Crowns have written", he said that [...] "it also speaks truth. And I think believers should speak truth to each other as long as we do it in love". Additionally, Hall noted that the band isn't simply criticizing others within the church with the song; he commented the first verse of the song speaks about himself.|$|E

5000|$|After {{completing}} the series, Robinson gave {{an interview to}} the Open University explaining his conclusions and beliefs about what was needed in the NHS http://www.open.edu/openlearn/money-management/management/leadership-and-management/managing/gerry-robinson-on-fixing-the-nhs-lessons-learned. Among his comments were: [...] I do believe that whilst {{there is a great}} deal one can do in terms of training people who already have a natural aptitude, unless you’re recruiting the very best young people, the very best senior people as a starting point so that they start to recognise those young people and bring them through, until we start taking the management of these complex organisations seriously, in the way that management is taken seriously in commercial organisations, frankly we’re just going to be chipping away at the edges of the problem in the NHS....I think what the NHS needs to learn is that actually you don’t solve problems by throwing money at it, and not every problem actually needs money to solve it. That’s the first lesson. Secondly, to get out of their heads the idea that things have to take three years to do and get into the idea that there is a series of objectives <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now, and that we’ve got months, not years to do it. Those two things, I think, would have the biggest single impact on the way that the Health Service is managed.|$|E
5000|$|Śamatha is {{approached}} somewhat {{differently in}} the mahāmudrā tradition as practiced in the Kagyu lineage. As Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche explains, In the practice of Mahamudra tranquility meditation ... we treat all thoughts as the same {{in order to gain}} sufficient distance and detachment from our current mental state, which will allow us to ease naturally into a state of tranquility without effort or contrivance ... In order for the mind to settle, we need to suspend the value judgments that we impose on our mental activities ... it is essential that we not try to create a state of tranquility but allow the mind to enter into tranquility naturally. This is an important notion in the Mahamudra tradition, that of nondoing. We do not do tranquility meditation, we allow tranquility to arise of its own accord, and it will do so only if we stop thinking of the meditative state as a thing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> actively ... In a manner of speaking, catching yourself in the act of distraction is the true test of tranquility meditation, for what counts is not the ability to prevent thoughts or emotions from arising but the ability to catch ourselves in a particular mental or emotional state. This is the very essence of tranquility meditation the context of Mahāmudrā ... The Mahamudra style of meditation does not encourage us toward the different levels of meditative concentration traditionally described in the exoteric meditation manuals ... From the Mahamudra point of view, we should not desire meditative equipoise nor have an aversion to discursive thoughts and conflicting emotions but view both of these states with equanimity. Again, the significant point is not whether meditative equipoise is present but whether we are able to maintain awareness of our mental states. If disturbing thoughts do arise, as they certainly will, we should simply recognize these thoughts and emotions as transient phenomena.|$|E
