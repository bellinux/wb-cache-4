50|$|Credit card {{transactions}} now {{represent a}} large percentage of low value transactions on which credit card companies charge merchants. Most of such credit card transactions are more of a habit than an actual need for credit {{and to the extent that}} such purchases represent convenience or lack of planning <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash</b> on the part of consumers, these transactions add a layer of unnecessary expense. However, debit or check card transactions are cheaper than processing paper checks.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, {{the debit}} card is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "bank card". It is a client card issued by a bank that provides access to funds and other bank account transactions, such as transferring funds, checking balances, paying bills, etc., as well as point of purchase transactions connected on the Interac network. Since its national launch in 1994, Interac Direct Payment has become so widespread that, as of 2001, more transactions in Canada were completed using debit cards than cash. This popularity may be partially attributable to two main factors: the convenience of not having <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash,</b> and the availability of automated bank machines (ABMs) and Direct Payment merchants on the network.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that strategic underperformance of debt-service obligations by equity holders can resolve the gap between observed yield spreads and those generated by Merton (1974) -style models. We show {{that this is not}} quite correct. The value of the option to underperform on debt-service obligations depends on two other optionalities available to equity holders, namely, the option <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash</b> reserves within the firm and the option to raise new external financing. We disentangle the effects of the three factors, and characterize the impact of each in isolation as well as their interaction. We find, among other things, that while strategic behavior can increase spreads significantly under some conditions, its impact is negligible in others, and in some cases it even leads to a decline in equilibrium spreads. We show that this last apparently paradoxical result is a consequence of an interaction of optionalities that results in a trade-off between strategic and liquidity-driven defaults. ...|$|E
40|$|Plastic cards have {{invaded the}} {{monetary}} {{market as a}} payment instrument used to purchase goods and services. There are several types of plastic cards in the circulation namely, credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, stored value cards and smart cards. The first credit card used to eliminate the need <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash</b> was the Mobil Oil, USA card issued in 1914 and the first form of charge card was the Diners card, which was used by businessmen in the 1950 's to purchase meals on an expense account. Since then, a variety of cards have been introduced to customers that have a multitude of functions for their daily transactional needs. The numbers of individuals that rely on cards have increased {{from year to year}} and presently the plastic card has become an indispensable instrument in the money wallet. Among all the different types of plastic cards, the most favoured by customers is the credit card. Statistics provided by Bank Negara Malaysia indicate that as at August 2007, principal card holders number 8. 22 million; supplementary card holders' number 1. 15 million; and in August 2007 the number of credit card transactions using (local and foreign) credit cards totaled 20. 21 million. 2 The credit card appears to be the most favourite plastic card among Malaysians. However, the downside of owning the credit card is the danger of it being used by unauthorized third parties to illegally purchase goods/services or to withdraw moneys/credit advances from the automated teller machine. Is the consumer protected from incurring the liability of such illegal transactions?

50|$|According to {{his best}} friend, Claude Garrec, the large {{quantity}} of cash {{found in his}} pockets, FF12,565 (approximately equivalent to Â£1,250 or US$2,500) {{could be attributed to}} a requirement of his job to run errands for wealthy guests at the Ritz Hotel when required.
