The obtained results are promising while in some traffic conditions, the estimated risk index model is able to detect crash occurrence about 6 to 7 minutes prior to the crash time.

40|$|Real <b>traffic</b> <b>measurements</b> and {{analysis}} over wide area networks {{is a challenge}} for many computer science and engineering educators. This is mainly because there are various networking tools available for measurements and testing over wide area networks {{and many of them}} have constraints, which limit their use to only a select group of users. As a result, the collection of wide area traffic data and their analyses becomes a difficult task, particularly in cases where the test site lacks collaboration support with other sites with which there is desire for <b>traffic</b> <b>measurements</b> to be used in undergraduate/graduate computer networking classes.

To exploit these opportunities, we emphasize {{the need for}} structural models that take into account specific physical features of the underlying communication network structure.

We demonstrate, in particular, how the proposed structural modeling approach provides a direct link between the observed self-similarity characteristic of measured aggregate network traffic, and the strong empirical evidence in favor of heavy-tailed, infinite variance phenomena at the level of individual network connections. 1.

Recent studies of high quality, high resolution <b>traffic</b> <b>measurements</b> in Bellcore Ethernets have revealed that this aggregate Ethernet traffic is self-similar ("fractal ") in nature, quite different in "burstiness" features from traffic considered and studied up to now. This paper presents an analytical study of an ATM buffer driven with self-similar traffic. The probability of buffer occupancy is obtained.
