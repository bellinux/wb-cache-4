Elongation of the leader shoot correlated with <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> expressed as degree-days. Total length of the leader shoot cor-related with growth rate but not with duration of the height-growth period. The longer the annual shoot {{at the end of}} the season, the greater the height increment per degree- and grow-ing day. Height-growth cessation was defined as the date when 95 % of the total shoot length was achieved. In all stands and all years, height growth ceased when, on average, 41 % of the rela-tive <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> of the site was achieved (range of varia-tion 38 – 43 %). The relative <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> was calculated by dividing the actual <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> by the long-term mean for the site.

Four field experiments were performed in which seed was used that had been exposed to different storage temperature regimes, differing in total <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> or in timing or duration of a warm period. Emergence, number of stems, number of tubers, and early and mature tuber yield were assessed. During the storage period, the onset of sprouting was recorded. Cultivars with a high rate of physiological degeneration ("ageing") were usually sensitive to warm storage during {{the second part of the}} storage period, especially if the first 12 to 18 wk of storage had also been warm. This was reflected in reduced emergence (10 %), low densities of stems (0. 5 stems m¿ 2) and tubers (5 tubers m¿ 2), and low yields, especially with early harvesting (20 g m¿ 2). Specific phasing of the warm period could reduce yields to levels even below the yield of the seed tubers exposed to the highest accumulated <b>temperature</b> <b>sum.</b> A higher <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> after the end of dormancy advanced and accelerated the process of ageing of seed tubers.

Several modelling approaches are currently available. Among them are approaches like modelling under standard conditions, <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> models and dynamic modelling.

The method is computationally feasible. Model calculations on simulated data show that this approach is at least equivalent to existing approaches, and often outperforms them in terms of statistical fit (R 2 adj of over 90 %, and often 99. 5 %). Moreover, it has the major advantage of estimating parameters that have an interpretation in the biochemical reality.

This paper describes a dynamic, mechanistic model for sweet pepper, addressing issues such as leaf area expansion, dry matter partitioning and validation. Leaf area formation and organ initiation are simulated as a function of <b>temperature</b> <b>sum.</b> Light absorption and photosynthesis are calculated for a multi-layered uniform canopy. Leaf photosynthesis is calculated for the various leaf layers according to the biochemical model of Farquhar, and integrated to canopy photosynthesis. Net assimilate production is calculated as the difference between canopy gross photosynthesis and maintenance respiration. The net assimilate production is used for growth of the different plant organs and for growth respiration. Fruit set is simulated as a function of source and sink strength and temperature. Assimilate partitioning between vegetative parts and individual fruits is simulated {{on the basis of the}} concept of sink strengths. The sink strength of each individual fruit is calculated as a function of its <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> from anthesis.

Conventional methods for estimating the onset of tree growth use cumulative <b>temperature</b> <b>sums.</b> These estimates, however, are quite coarse, and raise questions about making better use of the weather information available. We approach the problem of pre-dicting the onset of tree growth with a predictor based on a combination of a k-nearest neighbor regressor and a linear regressor. The inputs are weighted <b>sums</b> of daily <b>temperatures,</b> where the weights are determined by a subset of Bernstein polynomials chosen with a variable selection methodology. The predictions are smoothed for consecutive days to give more accurate results. We compare our proposed solution to the more conventional approach.

40|$|Spring {{phenology}} {{is considered}} one of the most important determinants of growth and survival in young stands. It is relatively easy to monitor and is expected to respond to climate changes that will affect the favourable period for growth in temperate regions. The response of trees to the environmental cues that govern spring phenology is largely under genetic control and inter-populational differences exist within species. This suggests that the trait undergoes site-specific selection. Data obtained through monitoring of bud burst at multiple beech provenance-trials were compared with specific site and weather data to reveal geographical clines in beech phenology. We fitted the Weibull function to harmonise phenology data collected using various flushing scales and at different intensities of monitoring. By comparing data from 20 annual census of phenology performed across 13 sites throughout Europe, we showed that accumulated <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> > 5 °C modelled the timing and duration of flushing more consistently than other <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> models > 0 °C or > 8 °C, or simply Julian Day. Inconsistency in the number of degree hours required for flushing among sites, reinforced the need for testing of more complex mechanistic models that include photoperiod, chilling period, and summer drought in addition to <b>temperature</b> <b>sum.</b> South-North, East-West, and low-high elevational clines were confirmed from the analysis. These findings; reinforce the need for caution in planting provenances from the south-east of Europe, suited to warmer-drier summers, in more north-westerly sites; and highlight the location of some potentially valuable late-flushing populations that also tolerate warm dry temperatures...|$|E

Changes in developmental rates, which shorten or prolong the growing time may aggravate or reduce the effects of sub-optimal conditions on yield. Therefore, the effect of defoliation on development of cauliflower was investigated in a number of field experiments. Reduction in curd growth due to defoliation during the curd growth phase was compensated by an increased duration of curd growth. It was estimated that defoliation during curd induction corresponded to an increase in <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> requirement for curd induction of 15 to 25 degree days, while defoliation during curd growth increased the <b>temperature</b> <b>sum</b> requirement with 12 to 60 degree days. Measurement of maturity by means of curd specific weight showed that defoliation delayed maturity.

As Southworth et al.

However rare, if studies do evaluate distinct varieties, the findings are similar as Liu et al. [18] could show for Northeast China. Most studies, however, only hint in a more general way towards the influence of variety choice [19 - 21].|$|R
