The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

For most of the employees, the firm confers on them <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community. The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.|$|E

Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.|$|E
25|$|What makes Tipling's {{photographic}} work distinctive is {{his artistic}} sense of composition. His work {{is influenced by}} the Swedish painter Bruno Liljefors whose often brooding depictions of predator-prey action – the hunts engaged between sea eagle and eider, goshawk and black grouse – help to create their darkly primitive atmosphere. and by Robert Gillmor's strong graphic,. Tipling cites some of the great Eastern painters who practised Oriental ink painting which has its roots in calligraphy, as influential. Much of his work resonates with <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> proportion achieved in the light, striking shapes of Xu Wei's work.|$|E
25|$|If Wilson's {{record as}} prime {{minister}} was soon felt to {{have been one of}} failure, <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.|$|E

25|$|Led by the {{minister}} of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1200 members in Orange County, California. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests {{that many of the}} individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired known city employees who were Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "New Rules" [...] was {{directed}} by Henry Scholfield, who also shot Lipa's previous visual, [...] "Lost in Your Light". The singer invited Scholfield {{for a cup of}} tea in London in order to discuss her ideas for the clip. Lipa had saved a picture of model Naomi Campbell holding another woman in her back during a campaign in the 1980s as a [...] "reference point", explaining that, [...] "I loved the idea of girls looking after each other like that, holding each other, <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humility, <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> strength." [...] Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered them a good representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that [...] "narrative of togetherness and empowerment" [...] into it. Barcelo also took inspiration from the flamingos' movements while planning the choreography. More than 200 women auditioned for the video, with eight being selected.|$|E

[...] These writers, and others like Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold <b>that</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> injustice is a powerful motivational condition — unlike the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.|$|R

500|$|On December 8, Anons {{launched}} {{an attack against}} PayPal's main site. According to Topiary, {{who was in the}} command channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the botnets of two hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault. Security researcher Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the [...] "zombie computers" [...] of involuntary botnets had provided 90% of the attack. Topiary states that he and other Anons then [...] "lied a bit to the press to give it <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> abundance", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership. However, this account was disputed.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, in {{acknowledgment}} of the [...] "wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website. The developers acknowledged that the Halo series' use of ring-shaped megastructures followed on from concepts featured in Larry Niven's Ringworld and Iain M. Banks' Culture series (of which Consider Phlebas and Excession {{were said to be}} particularly influential). In a retrospective article in Edge, Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, [...] "The influence of something like Ringworld isn't necessarily in the design– it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. <b>That</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> scale and an epic story going on out there." [...] Griesemer also explained, [...] "One of the main sources of inspiration was Armor , in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. <b>That</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential." [...] The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species in Christopher Rowley's The Vang; it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name [...] "John 117" [...] may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley's Starhammer, or to the John Spartan character of Demolition Man. An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in the Halo franchise commented on similarities between Halo and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game: aspects of the SPARTAN Project and the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel. Bungie has also acknowledged James Cameron's film Aliens as a strong cinematic influence.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} Darwinism informs his {{everyday}} apprehension of life, Dawkins says, [...] "in one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide {{open to the}} extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E

[...] In his review of Family Guy, volume 3, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] " [...] I will say there are some very good episodes in this set, starting with 'Petarded', which sees Peter declared mentally retarded. The ways he takes advantage of this status is classic Family Guy material, while the musical montage here, involving phone calls all over town, is actually quite funny.

500|$|Peter's uncle. Sheen {{admitted}} he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal, and knew {{little of the}} character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part. Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, [...] "I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. I {{have to give him}} the marching orders and so forth." [...] Webb said, [...] "You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [...] He has <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-à-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents." [...] Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.|$|E
500|$|<b>That</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{crossing}} cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, at {{the heart}} of Blonde on Blonde: [...] " [...] was the quintessential New York hipster—what was he doing in Nashville?

[...] For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques: [...] " [...] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of [...] "early in the mornin"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction." ...|$|E

Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for Dungeon Keeper 3, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as Harry Potter.
