Lennon, amused <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> was putting so much effort into understanding the Beatles' lyrics, decided to write in his next song the most confusing lyrics that he could.|$|E

500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 Helen Giddings, a Democratic {{member of}} the Texas House of Representatives, first {{authored}} the anti student-teacher sex bill but only intended for it to into effect if the student is 17 or younger. Warren Chisum of Pampa removed the maximum age from the bill. The bill was passed in 2003. Shortly after the law passed, a teacher engaged in sexual intercourse with her 18-year-old student, and a Texas court refused to indict her. In 2011 an amendment made it so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> is forbidden from having sexual relations with any student in his/her school district, not just his/her school. Afterwards criminal prosecutions of teachers in relationships with students going to other schools in the same school district, including teachers of other educational levels, began occurring. In response to this law, Houston lawyer Dick DeGuerin stated [...] "Unless there's real strong evidence of a teacher trading sex for grades or using improper influence, then it's a statute that is really open to abuse." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Sansone and Morgan, when {{students}} are already motivated to engage in an activity for their own personal pleasure and then a teacher provides the student with feedback, the type of feedback given can change the way that student views the activity and can even undermine their intrinsic motivation. [...] Maclellan also looked at the relationship between tutors and students and in particular, {{and the type of}} feedback the tutor would give to the student. Maclellan’s results showed that praise or criticism directed towards the student generated a feeling of “fixed intelligence” while praise and criticism directed towards the effort and strategy used by the student generated a feeling of “malleable intelligence” [...] [...] In other words, feedback concerning effort and strategy leaves students knowing that there is room for growth. This is important because {{when students}} believe their intelligence is “fixed”, their mindset can prevent skill development because students will believe that they only have a “certain amount” of understanding on a particular subject matter and might not even try.Therefore, it’s crucial <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> is aware of how the feedback they give to their students can both positively and negatively impact the student’s engagement and motivation [...]|$|E

2500|$|Thoreau neither {{rejected}} civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead {{he sought}} a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture.

He decried the latter endlessly but felt <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> needs {{to be close to}} those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred [...] "partially cultivated country." [...] His idea of being [...] "far in the recesses of the wilderness" [...] of Maine was to [...] "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay [...] "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [...] Roderick Nash wrote, [...] "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps some individuals, {{who have}} had some {{collision}} with their trustees or committee, will ask me if I mean, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> ought to be entirely and immediately under the supervision {{and control of the}} trustees, just as a mechanic is when employed by another man. By no means. There are various circumstances connected with the nature of this employment; the impossibility of the employers fully understanding it in all its details; and the character and the standing of the teacher himself, which always will, in matter of fact, prevent this. The employers always will, in a great many respects, place more confidence in the teacher and in his views, than they will in their own. But still, the ultimate power is theirs. Even if they err,--if they wish to have a course pursued which is manifestly inexpedient and wrong, they still have a right to decide. It is their work: it is going on at their instance, and at their expense, and the power of ultimate decision, on all disputed questions, must, from {{the very nature of the}} case, rest with them. The teacher may, it is true, have his option either to comply with their wishes or to seek employment in another sphere; but while he remains in the employ of any persons, whether in teaching or in any other service, he is bound to yield to the wishes of his employers, when they insist upon it, and to submit pleasantly to their direction, when they shall claim their undoubted right to direct.|$|E
