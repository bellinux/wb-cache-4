40|$|Abstract. Managers of {{open source}} {{projects}} need <b>to</b> understand <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve bugs, which are reported into a bug tracking system {{on a daily}} basis, to make a release plan. Hewett et al. proposed an empirical approach <b>to</b> predicting <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> repair bugs. However, the predictive model did not distinguish between <b>time</b> <b>to</b> modify a firstly-reported bug and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> re-modify a bug. In this paper, toward predicting <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve bugs with accuracy, we identify such the differences of time between bug modifications and re-modifications. We have conducted a case study using Firefox project data. As {{a result of this}} case study, we have confirmed that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve a firstly reported bug was shorter than <b>time</b> <b>to</b> re-modify a bug.
