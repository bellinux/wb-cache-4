In 2007, the store held a fashion exhibition to celebrate the Casual Male Retail Group acquisition of the men's big & tall clothing company Jared M., a company popular among athletes and celebrities for its custom sportswear; several NBA players were happy to show their support since the founder had fitted many of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

However, he was arrested and tried by the junta for corruption and abuse of power, and sentenced to five years in prison.

25|$|In 2013, Bryant had a legal {{disagreement}} with an auction house over memorabilia from {{his early years}} that his mother intended to auction. Pamela Bryant received $450,000 from the auction house for the items, and claimed Bryant had given her {{the rights to the}} items he had remaining in her home. However, his lawyers asked the auction house to return the items to Bryant. Before the scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing the sale of less than 10% of the original items. Bryant's parents apologized to him in a written statement, which also acknowledged the financial support Bryant had provided <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fish {{can seem}} mindful of which {{individuals}} have watched <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males {{were made to}} fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending time next to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more time next to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males they have seen win a fight over males they have seen losing, and it therefore makes sense for a male to prefer a female that has never seen him {{as opposed to a}} female that has seen him lose.|$|E
25|$|Guan Yu was {{returning}} to Nan Commandery when he heard that his territories in Jing Province had fallen to Lü Meng. He sent messengers to meet Lü Meng, who brought them {{on a tour of}} the city. When the messengers returned to Guan Yu, they spread the word that their families were well. Guan Yu's troops lost their fighting spirit after hearing that Lü Meng treated their families better than how Guan Yu treated <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Guan Yu knew that he had lost and was isolated, so he withdrew to Maicheng (麥城; around present-day Maicheng Village, Lianghe Town, Dangyang, Hubei). When they reached Zhang District (漳鄉) in the west, Guan Yu's men deserted and surrendered to Sun Quan's forces. Sun Quan sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to block Guan Yu's retreat route. Guan Yu and his son Guan Ping were captured by Sun Quan's forces in an ambush and subsequently executed. Liu Bei lost all his territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan.|$|E

25|$|Multisocket {{adaptors}} {{allow the}} connection {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality adaptors are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non fire resistant ABS), and these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E
