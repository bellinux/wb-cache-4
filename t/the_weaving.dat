40|$|The {{electrical}} permittivity of <b>the</b> <b>weaves</b> {{obtained from}} natural cellulosic yarns or mixed with synthetic fibers was established with capacitor method. The highest value of relative electrical permittivity {{in case of}} <b>the</b> <b>woven</b> fabric from natural cellulosic fibers has been observed at <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> made of pure hemp (13. 55) and the lowest at <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> obtained from <b>the</b> pure jute—weave packing (1. 87). Electrical permittivity value of <b>the</b> pure jute <b>weave</b> packing is {{comparable to that of}} the permittivity for the glass thread, when the work conditions are as follows: temperature 25 °C and air humidity 35 %. The relative electrical permittivity of <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> is depending on the degree of crimping yarns especially in the weft direction, technological density in direction of the warp and weft, and surface mass of <b>the</b> <b>weave...</b>|$|R

5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, David Sasson {{immigrated to}} Bombay and {{established}} himself as a magistrate of the cotton industry. He built the Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata in 1861; this was in addition to the older Magen Hasidim synagogue. His son, Abdulla Sassoon, transformed <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece of land in the hub of Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon. It was established in 1884.|$|E

Of the 108 holy temples of the Hindu god Vishnu, 14 are located in Kanchipuram. The town is {{particularly}} important to Sri Vaishnavism, but is also a holy pilgrimage site in Shaivism. The town is well known for its hand woven silk sarees and most of the town's workforce is involved in <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects and classes together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While {{it is expected that}} the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will require more computation time due to <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code than would usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> Shadow <b>Weave</b> is a {{separate}} force of magic, it is not affected by areas of dead magic or wild magic within <b>the</b> <b>Weave.</b> It is harder for a Weave user to perceive, counter or dispel spells created by using <b>the</b> Shadow <b>Weave,</b> but at <b>the</b> same time it is also harder for a Shadow Weave user to affect spells created by using <b>the</b> <b>Weave.</b> Any magic item created using <b>the</b> Shadow <b>Weave</b> is a Shadow Weave item and affected by the same benefits and limitations as a Shadow Weave spell.|$|R

5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} utilitarian blankets {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Talbot (September 7, 1818– October 6, 1885) was an American textile mill {{owner and}} {{politician}} from Massachusetts, United States.

5000|$|The {{quality of}} a Panama hat {{is defined by the}} {{tightness}} of <b>the</b> <b>weave.</b> Historically, to measure the tightness of <b>the</b> <b>weave,</b> a simple square tool that looks like a frame for a one-inch picture was used. The aperture of this frame was 25mm, or about 1 inch. The regulator would set this frame one inch {{from the edge of the}} hat's brim edge, and then count the peaks of <b>the</b> cross <b>weaves,</b> called carerra, moving in a parallel direction. <b>The</b> tighter <b>the</b> <b>weave,</b> <b>the</b> more carerras were counted. That number would be multiplied by two and reconciled against a grading chart. A highly refined grade 20 would consist of 16 carerras.|$|R
50|$|The {{retraction}} {{strength of}} the PAM {{is limited by the}} sum total strength of individual fibers in <b>the</b> <b>woven</b> shell. <b>The</b> exertion distance is limited by the tightness of the weave; a very loose weave allows greater bulging, which further twists individual fibers in <b>the</b> <b>weave.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 15th century <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> of fine kersies {{and later}} serges was {{introduced}} to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the fleeces would be combed and sorted. John Lane {{was one of the best}} known local cloth merchants (see Lane's Aisle in the section on St Andrew's church below). In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King's Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and 'many spinners'. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and worsted cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. To manage it she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts. Later the business evolved into machine knitted garments.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century farming {{became less}} {{economic}} when {{construction of the}} reservoirs reduced the amount of agricultural land in the village. <b>The</b> <b>weaving</b> industry was mechanised, small mines closed and the population declined further when properties in the village were demolished in the early 20th century. Agriculture, mainly sheep farming, continues although on a small scale. Tourism at Rivington began in Victorian times and after the reservoirs were filled in the 1860s {{was known as the}} Little Lake District. Rivington became a popular destination when Lever Park opened in 1904. From the late Victorian period until the mid-20th century tourists from Bolton travelled on day trips by tram along Chorley New Road and then on to Rivington on foot, many more visitors arrived by train.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.|$|E
30|$|Turhan and Eren (2012) studied <b>the</b> {{effect of}} <b>weaving</b> machine {{settings}} on <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> ability limits of air-jet machines. They found that changing the shed adjustment from the zero {{level of the}} backrest to higher values increased the maximum weavable weft density slightly; however, increasing the shed asymmetry further (backrest height) has no significant influence on <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> ability limit.|$|R

Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market. The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 18th century, the {{inhabitants}} of Chadderton raised domestic farm animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the domestic system. Primitive coal mining was established by the 17th century, and the factory system adopted in the late-18th century. During the Victorian era, Chadderton's economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industries, especially the spinning of cotton, but also <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> of silk and production of hats. By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 cotton mills. Industries ancillary to these sectors, including coal mining, brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were present. Chadderton developed an extensive coal mining sector auxiliary to Chadderton's cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry; Chadderton's last coal mine closed in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised the functioning of <b>the</b> <b>weaving</b> process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of}} the horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
