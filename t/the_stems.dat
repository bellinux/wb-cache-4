5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stems</b> of most cacti have {{adaptations to}} allow them to conduct {{photosynthesis}} in the absence of leaves. This is discussed further below under Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris. In Europe, various subspecies {{have been named}} based on characteristics such as the hairiness of the leaves, {{the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> are angled or rounded, and {{the size and shape of}} the terminal umbel.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> transmits motion {{from the}} handle or {{controlling}} device to <b>the</b> disc. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> typically {{passes through the}} bonnet when present. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and <b>the</b> disc can be combined in one piece, or <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and <b>the</b> handle are combined in one piece.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> of <b>the</b> verb is {{used for}} the second person {{singular}} imperative in Udmurt. If <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> of a conjugation I verb ends in one consonant or is one syllable and ends in a vowel, <b>the</b> short <b>stem</b> is <b>the</b> imperative. If <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> of a conjugation I verb ends in two consonants, <b>the</b> full <b>stem</b> is used.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem,</b> of <b>the</b> quill variety, is {{attached}} to the fork's steerer tube using an expander bolt which fits through <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> from <b>the</b> top with a wedge at <b>the</b> bottom, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> fits inside <b>the</b> steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> for adjustment, undo the bolt on the top of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.|$|R
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed or {{cuttings}} of hardened growth {{less than}} a year old. The seed can be collected from the cones and stored; they are best sown in spring or autumn. <b>The</b> <b>stems</b> and flowers are long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{bright green}} {{cotyledon}} {{leaves of the}} seedlings are oblong to linear in shape and measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> present <b>stem</b> is {{characterized}} by the insertion of ne after <b>the</b> infinitive <b>stem</b> and so <b>the</b> final syllable of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is open, and hence the final consonant of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is in strong grade: ...|$|R
50|$|The foliage along <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is evenly distributed, and {{consists}} of three to seven broadly ovate pointed leaves. Those on the rhizomes are less developed than the reddish leaves on <b>the</b> flowering <b>stems.</b> Along <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> leaves grow alternately, at their bases they sheath <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> almost entirely.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> is [...] by , {{roughly equal}} in width throughout, often crooked, and becomes hollow with age. The color of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> surface is lemon yellow, {{and it is}} covered with glandular dots that bruise if handled. The partial veil is not {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and usually does not leave an ring on <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> A whitish mycelium present {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> helps anchor <b>the</b> fruit body in the substrate. The flesh is mustard yellow, and stains pinkish-brown when cut or bruised.|$|R
5|$|The {{fruits of}} Schlumbergera do not open spontaneously when ripe, {{and appear to}} be adapted for {{distribution}} by birds, which eat the seeds and pulp contained in the fruit. Birds have been observed removing seeds which had stuck to their beaks by rubbing them on tree branches, where the seeds {{might be able to}} germinate. Segments may also break off from <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> and take root, thus enabling plants to propagate vegetatively.|$|E
5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut into the food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> or leaves where the thrips have fed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stems</b> of most cacti {{are some}} shade of green, often bluish or {{brownish}} green. Such stems contain chlorophyll {{and are able}} to carry out photosynthesis; they also have stomata (small structures that can open and close to allow passage of gases). Cactus stems are often visibly waxy.|$|E
50|$|Atop <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is {{an array}} of bright yellow flowers, each with four rounded petals. As <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> grows <b>the</b> flowers drop away to leave {{developing}} fruits, which are narrow siliques 2 to 12 centimeters long sticking out from <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> fruits contain winged seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Monopodial: <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> grows from {{a single}} bud, leaves are added from the apex each year and <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> grows longer accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> of orchids with a {{monopodial}} growth can reach several metres in length, as in Vanda and Vanilla.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Calendula arvensis, Calendula officinalis, Callistephus chinensis, Centaurea cyanus, Dahlia pinnata, Emilia flammea, Erigeron canadensis, Erigeron linifolius, Helichrysum bracteatum and Senecio cruentus. They bore {{into the}} flower-bud, flower, {{terminal}} end of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> or <b>the</b> fork of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> of <b>the</b> host plant. When the larva bores into <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> {{it makes a}} tunnel. The larva pupates within <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> or flower.|$|R
5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy areas on <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed {{similar to the}} ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
50|$|Third-declension nouns have one, two, {{or three}} stems, unlike first- and second-declension nouns, which always {{have only one}} stem. Each stem is used in {{different}} case-and-number forms. In nouns with two <b>stems,</b> <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> with <b>the</b> long vowel is called <b>the</b> strong <b>stem,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> with <b>the</b> short vowel is called <b>the</b> weak <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> strong <b>stem</b> is found at the nominative singular, and <b>the</b> weak <b>stem</b> in <b>the</b> genitive singular.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> is [...] {{long and}} up to [...] thick, equal in width {{throughout}} to slightly enlarged downward, flexible and filamentous but not fragile. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> surface is dry, whitish to grayish-orange, sometimes with tiny hairs on the upper portion that become coarser near <b>the</b> base. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> base often has rhizomorph-like strands or copious whitish mycelia. <b>The</b> <b>stem,</b> unlike <b>the</b> other two species of Collybia, do not originate from a sclerotium. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> becomes hollow as it matures. Although it is not considered poisonous, C.cirrhata is too small and insubstantial to be considered edible.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> is 3 - 9 cm by 0.4 - 1 cm, {{roughly equal}} in width throughout, often crooked, and becomes hollow with age. The color of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> surface is lemon yellow, {{and it is}} covered with glandular dots that bruise if handled. The partial veil is not {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and usually does not leave an ring on <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> A whitish mycelium present {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> helps anchor <b>the</b> fruit body in the substrate. The flesh is mustard yellow, and stains pinkish-brown when cut or bruised.|$|R
5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on <b>the</b> <b>stems,</b> and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has markedly pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread out around the cap, {{and all of them}} reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed within <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> of Polygonum thunbergii. Pupation {{takes place}} within <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> in late spring.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> is clavate up to 20 cm tall, and 4 cm thick. In mature specimens, {{the partial}} veil is torn and left behind as a {{pendulous}} ring adorning <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> Above <b>the</b> ring, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is white to yellow and smooth. Below, it {{is covered with}} numerous small scales. Its flesh is thick, white and sometimes has a narrow central hollow. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> base extends deeply into the substrate.|$|R
30|$|Among the {{barriers}} {{that make the}} alignment between <b>the</b> <b>STEM</b> vision and implementation challenging, {{especially in the case}} of <b>the</b> one-for-all <b>STEM</b> teacher, is <b>the</b> epistemological differences between <b>the</b> <b>STEM</b> disciplines.|$|R
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by {{the combination of a}} molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
40|$|Image {{processing}} {{techniques and}} statistical classifiers {{were used to}} grade cut roses. Grading {{was based on the}} straightness of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> <b>the</b> diameter of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and <b>the</b> maturity of the bud. The descriptors of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> straightness were本研究使用影像處理技術及統計分類器進行玫瑰切花品質分級。品質分級是依據 花莖的直度、花莖的粗細以及花苞的開度。花莖直度的描述參數是花莖最大偏移矩離和花莖 彎曲角度；花莖粗細的描述參數是花莖中間直徑及花莖底端直徑；花苞開度的描述參數是花 苞投影面積。所使用的統計分類器有最小矩離分類器、Fisher 線性分類器及 Bayes 分類器 。 經使用不同的描述參數和不同的分類器進行分級， 以 Fisher 線性分類器的分級正確率 69 ％為最高...|$|R
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and less strongly decurrent down <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> flowering <b>stem</b> is solid and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. <b>The</b> dried <b>stems</b> may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|R
50|$|Pachypodium inflorescence, or {{clusters}} of flowers, appear {{either at the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> growing directly off <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> or attached to <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> by branchlets. <b>The</b> bracts, or leaves surrounding the inflorescence, resemble sepals. Flower stalks range in length from 0 to 56 mm.|$|R
