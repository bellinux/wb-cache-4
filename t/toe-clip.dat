Although {{they are known}} to be conspecific, hybridization will occur when there are limited option for reproduction. Identification was done through <b>toe-clip</b> sampling, and by analyzing the samples it was possible to find relationship of hybridization between the cotton mouse and the white-footed mouse(Peromyscus gossypinus megacephalus) based on a heterozygous GPI-1 marker. Additional evidence for hybridization was through comparison of body mass and hind foot length differentiating among areas scarce in cotton mouse population to higher populated areas.|$|E
50|$|An older {{system is}} the <b>toe-clip</b> and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage {{attached}} {{to the front of}} the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic shoe plate or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with toe clip and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the claim that {{reductions}} of 8 - 18 % in submaximal oxygen consumption (VO 2) could be due to changing components on a Monark ergometer, from standard pedals without toe-clips or straps (flat pedals) to racing pedals of that era, which included toe-clips and straps (<b>toe-clip</b> pedals). This previously untested assertion was evaluated using 11 males (mean age 22. 3 years, s= 1. 2; height 1. 82 m, s= 0. 07; body mass 82. 6 kg, s= 8. 8) who completed four trials in a randomized, counterbalanced order at 60 rev center dot min(- 1) on a Monark cycle ergometer. Two trials were completed on flat pedals and two trials on <b>toe-clip</b> pedals. The Douglas bag method was used to assess VO 2 and gross efficiency during successive 5 -min workloads of 60, 120, 180, and 240 W. The mean VO 2 was 2. 1 % higher for <b>toe-clip</b> pedals than flat pedals and there was a 99 % probability that <b>toe-clip</b> pedals would not result in an 8 % lower VO 2.

40|$|<b>Toe-clipping,</b> {{the removal}} {{of one or more}} toes, is a common method used to {{individually}} mark free-living animals. Whilst this method is widely used in studies of amphibians, the appropriateness of the method, and its potential detrimental effects {{have been the subject of}} debate. Here, we provide for the first time, evidence that <b>toe-clipping</b> is a stressor in a wild amphibian. We measured urinary corticosterone responses of male cane toads (Rhinella marina) to capture and handling only, and to <b>toe-clipping</b> under field conditions. Urinary testosterone concentrations and white blood cell proportions were also measured. Urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations increased 6 h after capture and handling only and remained high for 24 h; corticosterone returned to baseline levels after 48 h and remained low at 72 h post capture and handling. Corticosterone concentrations in toads subjected to <b>toe-clipping</b> increased at 6 h to significantly higher concentrations than after capture and handling only, then decreased more slowly than after capture and handling, and were still elevated (approximately double basal level) 72 h after <b>toe-clipping.</b> Testosterone did not change significantly after capture and handling only, whereas after <b>toe-clipping</b> testosterone decreased at 6 h and remained low at 72 h. There were weak short-term effects of <b>toe-clipping</b> compared with capture and handling only on white blood cell proportions. We have clearly shown that <b>toe-clipping</b> is a distinctly stronger stressor than capture and handling alone. This indicates that there is an ethical cost of <b>toe-clipping,</b> and this should be considered when planning studies of amphibians.

Although many amphibian marking techniques have been developed, few meet the rigorous assumptions of capture-mark-recapture models. Also, excessive <b>toe-clipping</b> may affect frog survivorship adversely. We tested the efficacy of a new hybrid marking technique (VIE-C) that combines Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) and <b>toe-clipping</b> on four species of treefrogs in West-Central Florida. Of the 840 treefrogs recaptured over a 15 -month period, only one mark was unreadable.

40|$|A small {{population}} (n= 58) of Maud Island frogs, Leiopelma pakeka, was translocated to the Zealandia {{wildlife sanctuary}} in Wellington, New Zealand in 2006 / 2007. The 29 frogs that were released into a predator-proof enclosure, {{along with some}} of their progeny, are currently spread over three separate predator-proof enclosures. However, their status has not been assessed since 2011. With the aim of establishing a viable, freeranging population, the remaining 29 frogs were released into forested habitat around the original enclosure. In 2010, the translocation of the free-ranging population was assessed as a failure, citing too few founding individuals, inadequate habitat, predation by little spotted kiwi (LSK), Apteryx owenii, and predation by house mice, Mus musculus, as potential factors. This thesis re-addresses the status of L. pakeka in the three enclosures, as well as the potential predation of these threatened endemic frogs by LSK and mice. Survival of L. pakeka in the three enclosures was estimated by nocturnal emergence over 11 ve-night capture periods from October 2012 - August 2013. Identi cation of individuals was via photography utilizing distinguishable skin patterns and iris vessel (eye venation) patterns. The relocation of six adults after a 2011 census, including one inadvertently missed frog found during this study, left 19 adult frogs in the original enclosure, which continued to survive well, with 18 adults recaptured. In addition, juveniles of varying ages were seen throughout this study. In total, 34 recently metamorphosed froglets were released into a second enclosure over the years of 2008, 2009 and 2011. Night monitoring indicated only 8 individuals had survived, but a full enclosure census on 8 May 2013 revealed 12 of the 34 individuals (35 %) had survived. Three of these frogs were then relocated to the Te Mahanga, publicly viewed enclosure. Emergence during the 11 -month period indicated that the six frogs relocated to this enclosure from the original enclosure in October 2011 had survived; however, only two out of the three frogs that were relocated there after the May census had emerged. Additionally, two juveniles of unknown age were also seen in this enclosure. Potential predation by LSK was assessed by a ve-night video analysis (23 - 28 June 2013) of foraging behavior in the presence of mesh-protected L. pakeka. Out of the 668 videos reviewed, only three videos provided foraging behavior that helped ascertain whether LSK exhibited a potential interest in L. pakeka as a prey item. These videos showed that LSK failed to indicate a strong response to the presence of the frog, suggesting that the LSK in Zealandia do not have a strong predatory interest in L. pakeka. To investigate the potential causes of the free-range translocation failure, the habitat was enhanced with more rocks, a kiwi-exclusion fence was erected, and a further 101 L. pakeka were translocated from Maud Island to Zealandia on 2 December 2012. The frogs' survival as well as mouse activity levels (indicated by the presence of mouse prints in tracking tunnels) were monitored over nine ve-night capture periods from 17 December 2012 - 2 August 2013. Eighty-six out of the 101 translocated frogs were recaptured. Identi cation of individuals was via photography utilizing distinguishable skin patterns and iris vessel (eye venation) patterns, or by unique <b>toe-clip</b> combinations. Despite previous assessments, four surviving adults from the 2006 / 2007 translocation were recaptured as well as 12 of their progeny, resulting in a total of 117 Maud Island frogs for this study. Jolly-Seber analysis indicated high overall survival (0. 914, 0. 87 / 0. 94, 95 %CI), but temporally the population estimates indicated a negative regression starting at the second capture period (slope= - 4. 69, - 6. 70 /- 2. 68, 95 %CI). With overall frog emergence, a negative binomial generalized linear model did not show signi cance in mouse activity levels, precipitation during sampling nor precipitation in the previous 24 hours (p> 0. 05). However, temperature did show a positive correlation to overall frog emergence (p< 0. 001) while relative humidity approached signi cance (p= 0. 0517) and indicated a potential positive trend. This study could not conclusively indicate whether A. owenii or M. musculus prey upon L. pakeka. However, it does suggest that the protected predator-proof enclosures may provide appropriate conditions for the ongoing survival and successful breeding of the endemic anuran. The study also suggests that LSK do not have a strong predatory response to the presence of Maud Island frogs, nor did increased levels of mouse activity have a signi cant e ect on the emergence of the 117 Maud Island frogs. Additionally, the discovery of the four survivors and 12 of their o spring indicates that the original translocation did not entirely fail. This newly acquired knowledge suggests that with the current mammal eradication program, Zealandia may continue with the establishment of a viable, free-ranging population of L. pakeka. Continued monitoring of all Maud Island frogs in the Zealandia sanctuary is recommended as a conservation measure, especially as mice have now established on its original island habitat...|$|E

Marking animals may affect performance, which in turn could influence survival. We compared the effects of <b>toe-clipping</b> and elastomer tagging on the locomotor performance of frogs (jump distance) and skinks (running speed and endurance). We examined the immediate effect of marking, and the effect after a recovery period of two weeks. Jump distance decreased across all treatment groups in frogs immediately after marking, but <b>toe-clipped</b> individuals jumped less far {{in relation to their}} original jump distance than did elastomer tagged or control frogs. After two weeks, there was a relative increase in jump distance of the <b>toe-clipped</b> frogs, but for all groups performance was lower than {{at the start of the}} experiment. In skinks, both marking methods reduced skink endurance, and <b>toe-clipping</b> had a stronger negative effect on running speed than did elastomer tagging. After two weeks, skink endurance and running speed increased to above the initial measures for all treatment groups. Overall, <b>toe-clipping</b> had stronger immediate effects on locomotor performance, indicating that elastomer tagging may be a marginally better marking method...|$|R

Our aim was to evaluate handling and processing time plus recapture rates for fluorescent Visible Implant Alphanumeric (VIA) tags, <b>toe-clipping</b> and photographic identification techniques that would be suitable for use with Litoria ewingii and L. raniformis. VIA tags were initially trialled in these two species in captivity, using a range of insertion points. They were most effective in L. ewingii when inserted in the interfermoral sac. We found VIA tags were ineffective for L. raniformis, both because of skin pigmentation and subcutaneous lymph sacs were relatively large for the tag size so they migrated. Therefore we suggest VIA tags may be useful in juvenile L. raniformis only. Marking trials to compare the handling and processing times of the VIA tags, <b>toe-clipping</b> and photographic identification in the wild for L. ewingii were carried out in three ponds in Dunedin, New Zealand. VIA tags were significantly faster for recapture handling times, with <b>toe-clipping</b> having a significantly lower handling time on initial capture of an animal.

Here we quantified the success of microsatellite amplification and the rates of genotyping errors using buccal swabs in two amphibian species, the Alpine newt Triturus alpestris and the Green tree frog Hyla arborea, and we estimated two important parameters for downstream analyses, namely the number of repetitions required to achieve typing reliability and the probability of identity among genotypes. Amplification success was high, and only one locus tested required two to three repetitions to achieve reliable genotypes, showing that buccal swabbing is a very efficient approach allowing good quality DNA retrieval. This sampling method which allows avoiding the controversial <b>toe-clipping</b> will likely prove very useful in the context of amphibian conservation...|$|R
