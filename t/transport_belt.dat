2500|$|The Van de Graaff {{generator}} {{was invented}} by American physicist Robert J. Van de Graaff in 1929 at MIT as a particle accelerator. The first model was demonstrated in October 1929. [...] In the Van de Graaff machine, an insulating belt transports electric charge to the interior of an insulated hollow metal high voltage terminal, where it is transferred to the terminal by a [...] "comb" [...] of metal points. [...] The advantage of the design was that {{since there was no}} electric field in the interior of the terminal, the charge on the belt could continue to be discharged onto the terminal regardless of how high the voltage on the terminal was. [...] Thus the only limit to the voltage on the machine is ionization of the air next to the terminal. [...] This occurs when the electric field at the terminal exceeds the dielectric strength of air, about 30kV per centimeter. Since the highest electric field is produced at sharp points and edges, the terminal is made {{in the form of a}} smooth hollow sphere; the larger the diameter the higher the voltage attained. [...] The first machine used a silk ribbon bought at a five and dime store as the charge <b>transport</b> <b>belt.</b> In 1931 a version able to produce 1,000,000 volts was described in a patent disclosure.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a spiral conveyor {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the <b>transport</b> <b>belt</b> completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a spiral conveyor, because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a spiral conveyor. The drive motor of a spiral conveyor must always be controlled with a frequency regulator in order to prevent excessive slippage of the <b>transport</b> <b>belt.</b> It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the <b>transport</b> <b>belt</b> breaking down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a spiral conveyor. In the case of most spiral conveyors, products must also be presented centrally, as the eccentric loading of spiral conveyors can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the <b>transport</b> <b>belt</b> will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{coal mines}} fire {{consists}} {{of one of}} the main disasters, which usually take place for the reason that the water content of coal is over low. Over low water content of the coal <b>transported</b> with <b>belt</b> more likely brings about flying coal dust, which, when accumulated to some degree, will triggers explosion. Given that in China now coal is mainly <b>transported</b> with <b>belt</b> in coal mines, the author in this paper proposes a way to measure water content of coal <b>transported</b> with <b>belt</b> by use of microwave attenuation method and improve the measure accuracy through RBF neural network algorithm. This method is proved to be scientifically reasonable through laboratory simulation and experimentation. The theoretical basis and technical support are provided to increase the accuracy measuring water content of coal <b>transported</b> with <b>belt</b> by this method.

50|$|The Van de Graaff {{generator}} was developed, {{starting in}} 1929, at MIT. The first model was demonstrated in October 1929.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the failure {{analysis}} of a conveyor belt related {{to the place of}} impact where material lands. It studies how the number of conveyor carrying idlers influences the belt compression stress in the place of impact. The landing material is represented by an impactor of 500 kg landing from the height of 4 m. The analyses are grounded in mathematical modelling of the <b>transport</b> <b>belt</b> and experimentally determine the quantities vital for the simulations. The place of impact under examination is the critical site of the whole facility as it is subject to extreme stress. The failure analysis considers two variants of idler number in the place of material impact. The results clearly demonstrate that the construction making use of a higher number of idlers is more suitable due to lower deformations of the belt. The conclusions presented in the article may thus lead to conveyor belt construction optimisations, and thus contribute to their longer life. At the same time, there is a great potential for further research, as the topic of longer conveyor belt life via changing the number of carrying idlers at the place of impact has not been widely investigated.

An irrigation scheme is {{incorporated into the}} Noah land surface scheme of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model that has a calibrated convective parameterization and a tracer package is used to tag and track water vapor. To {{assess the impact of}} irrigation over the California Central Valley (CCV) on the regional climate of the U. S. Southwest, simulations are run (for three dry and three wet years) both with and without the irrigation scheme. Incorporation of the irrigation scheme resulted in simulated surface air temperature and humidity that were closer to observations, decreased depth of the planetary boundary layer over the CCV, and increased convective available potential energy. The result was an overall increase in precipitation over the Sierra Nevada range and the Colorado River basin during the summer. Water vapor rising from the irrigated region mainly moved northeastward and contributed to precipitation in Nevada and Idaho. Specifically, the results indicate increased precipitation on the windward side of the Sierra Nevada and over the Colorado River basin.

40|$|Stratosphere {{circulation}} {{is important}} to interpret abundances of photo-chemically produced compounds like ozone that we aim to observe to assess habitability of exoplanets. We thus investigate a tidally locked ExoEarth scenario for TRAPPIST- 1 b, TRAPPIST- 1 d, Proxima Centauri b and GJ 667 C f with a simplified 3 D atmosphere model and for different stratospheric wind breaking assumptions. These planets are representatives for different circulation regimes for orbital periods: P_orb= 1 - 100 days. The circulation of exoplanets with P_orb≤ 25 days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave in the troposphere {{and also in the}} stratosphere: It leads to a strong equatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that confines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the distribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited to an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with P_orb> 25 days, like GJ 667 C f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the stratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses. The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked ExoEarths with P_orb≤ 25 days can, however, be circumvented with deep stratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like on Earth. For planets with 3 ≤ P_orb≤ 6 days, the extratropical Rossby wave acts as an additional safe-guard against the tropical Rossby wave in case of shallow wind breaking. Therefore, TRAPPIST- 1 d is less prone to have an equatorial <b>transport</b> <b>belt</b> in the stratosphere than Proxima Centauri b. Even our Earth model shows an equatorial wind jet, if stratosphere wind breaking is inefficient. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|E
30|$|Since the {{mathematical}} {{treatment of the}} whole process at a stroke is not possible due to its complexity, a hierarchy of models that adequately describe partial aspects of the process chain has been developed in research during the last years. In [1] the conjunction of those models has been elaborated using asymptotic analysis, similarity estimates and parameter identification. More precisely, {{the description of the}} fiber dynamics in turbulent air flows has been realized by a stochastic generalized string model that has been deduced from a special Cosserat rod under Kirchhoff constraint, consult [2, 3] for its derivation. This provides the basis for the software tool FIDYSTa that enables the full simulation of fiber motion under the influence of surrounding turbulent air flows up to the fiber lay-down on the <b>transport</b> <b>belt.</b> In this manner, the microstructure of virtual fiber webs can be in principle generated. However, this approach is computationally expensive and the complexity is strongly affected by the number of fibers. For this reason, a class of stochastic surrogate models has been proposed in order to compute only the image of the deposited fiber web, instead of describing the full fiber dynamics that lead to this web. These surrogate models have in common the structure of a system of ordinary stochastic differential equations that enables the fast computation of a considerable number of fibers. They contain parameters that are related to the physical production process, as for example turbulence influence and fiber coiling, and that have to be identified from the full simulation of a few fibers with help of the complex string model. Based on the original two-dimensional version in [4], the surrogate models have been frequently improved within the last years. This includes the addition of a moving conveyor belt [5] or, more general, the consideration of more specific types of production processes as for instance rotational spinning processes [1]. Further enhancements are given by a smooth version in [6] where the curvatures of the fibers are taken into account, and by modelling the lay-down in three dimensions [7, 8]. The latter has been intended as first step into a realistic generation of three-dimensional microstructures {{that can be used for}} study of flow resistance and elasticity of the non-woven. The mathematical analysis of these models is sophisticated due to degeneracies of the associated Fokker-Planck equations. The trend to equilibrium for the original two-dimensional model has been investigated using Dirichlet forms and operator semi-group techniques in [9], with a hypocoercivity method in [10] and with probabilistic methods in [11 – 13]. The higher-dimensional models have been accordingly analyzed in [13, 14]. With the help of various techniques from asymptotic analysis connections between these models have been shown and model reduction in the situation of large or small turbulence have been performed in [4 – 8]. A possible strategy for estimating the parameters of the two-dimensional models has been provided as a heuristic approach in [1] which has been successfully tested by FIDYST simulations of transversal as well as rotational spinning processes in the stated source. In [7] an extension of this identification strategy to the three-dimensional case has been proposed on condition that information about the fiber orientation is available. In this work we realize this approach in a real industrial problem for the first time. At the example of a pilot plant of the company Oerlikon Neumag, we discuss the calibration of the smooth three-dimensional surrogate model and illustrate the computation of corresponding fiber webs. For this we need both the full simulation of a few representative fibers with regard to the problem setting and image processing data from CT-scans of the resulting non-woven.|$|E
40|$|Alterations to {{the land}} surface can be {{attributed}} to both human activity and natural variability. Human activities, such as urbanization and irrigation, can change the conditions of the land surface by altering albedo, soil moisture, aerodynamic roughness length, the partitioning of net radiation into sensible and latent heat, and other surface characteristics. On the other hand, natural variability, manifested through changes in atmospheric circulation, can also induce land surface changes. These regional scale land surface changes, induced either by humans or natural variability, can effectively modify atmospheric conditions through land-atmosphere interactions. However, only in recent decades have numerical models begun to include representations of the critical processes driving changes at the land surface, and their associated effects on the overlying atmosphere. In this work we explore three mechanisms by which changes {{to the land}} surface–both anthropogenic and naturally induced–impact the overlying atmosphere and affect regional hydroclimate. The first land-atmosphere interaction mechanism explored here is land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) due to urban expansion. Such changes alter the surface albedo, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity of the surface. Consequently, the energy balance in urban regions is different from that of natural surfaces. To evaluate the changes in regional hydroclimate that could arise due to projected urbanization in the Phoenix–Tucson corridor, Arizona, my first study applied the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) with an Urban Canopy Model (UCM; which includes a detailed urban radiation scheme) coupled to the Noah land surface model to this region. Land-cover changes were represented using land-cover data for 2005 and projections to 2050, and historical North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data were used to specify the lateral boundary conditions. Results suggest that temperature changes are well defined, reflecting the urban heat island (UHI) effect within areas experiencing LULCC, whereas changes in precipitation are less certain (statistically less robust). However, the study indicates the likelihood of reductions in precipitation over the mountainous regions northeast of Phoenix and decreased evening precipitation over the newly urbanized area. The second land-atmosphere interaction mechanism explored here is irrigation which, while being an important anthropogenic factor affecting the local to regional water cycle, is not typically represented in regional climate models. In this (second) study, I incorporated an irrigation scheme into the Noah land surface scheme coupled to the WRF model. Using a newly developed water vapor tracer package (developed by Miguez-Macho et al. 2013), the study tracks the path of water vapor that evapotranspires from the irrigated regions. To assess the impact of irrigation over the California Central Valley (CCV) on the regional climate of the U. S. Southwest, I ran six simulations (for three dry and three wet years), both with and without the irrigation scheme. Incorporation of the irrigation scheme resulted in simulated surface air temperature and humidity that were closer to observations, decreased the depth of the planetary boundary layer over the CCV, and increased the convective available potential energy. The results indicated an overall increase in precipitation over the Sierra Nevada Range and the Colorado River Basin during the summer, with water vapor rising from the irrigated region moving mainly northeastward and contributing to precipitation in Nevada and Idaho. The results also indicate an increase in precipitation on the windward side of the Sierra Nevada Range and over the Colorado River Basin. The former is possibly linked to a sea-breeze type circulation near the CCV, while the latter is likely associated with a wave pattern related to latent heat release over the moisture <b>transport</b> <b>belt.</b> In the third study, I investigated the role of large-scale and local-scale processes associated with heat waves using the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis, and evaluate the performance of the regional climate model ensemble used in the North America Regional Climate Change Program (NARCCAP) in reproducing these processes. The Continental US is divided into different climate divisions (following the convention of the National Climate Assessment) to investigate different mechanisms associated with heat waves. At the large scale, warm air advection from terrestrial sources is a driving factor for heat waves in the Northeast and Midwest. Over the western United States, reduced maritime cool air advection results in local warming. At the local scale, an antecedent precipitation deficit leads to the continuous drying of soil moisture, more energy being partitioned into sensible heat flux and acting to warm surface air temperatures, especially over the Great Plains. My analysis indicates that the NARCCAP simulated large-scale meteorological patterns and temporal evolution of antecedent local-scale terrestrial conditions are very similar to those of MERRA. However, NARCCAP overestimates the magnitude and underestimates the frequency of Northeastern and Midwestern US heat waves, partially due to anomalous heat advection through large-scale forcing. Overall, the aforementioned studies show that utilization of new parameterizations in land surface models, such as the urban canopy scheme and the irrigation scheme, allow us to understand the detailed physical mechanisms by which anthropogenic changes in the land surface can affect regional hydroclimate, and may thus help with informed decision making and climate adaptation/mitigation. In addition to anthropogenic changes of the land surface, humans are of course affecting the overlying atmosphere. Currently, NARCCAP is the best available tool we have to help us understand the effects of changes greenhouse gas induced climate change at the regional scale. The regional climate models participating in NARCCAP are able to realistically represent the dominant processes associated with heat waves, including the atmospheric circulation changes and the land-atmosphere interactions that drive heat waves. This lends credibility, when analyzing the projections of these models with increased GHG emissions, to the assessment of changes in heat waves under a future climate...|$|E

Dieser Zustand konnte durch die Verwendung eines gliederlosen Zugmittels in Form eines Transportzahnriemens deutlich verbessert sowie die Transportgeschwindigkeiten signifikant erhöht werden. Durch Modifikationen an den Riemen-zähnen werden Befestigungsmöglichkeiten für Kunststofftragplatten geschaffen...|$|R
50|$|The macrocilia move in unison. They are angled {{towards the}} gullet and are stacked {{on top of}} each other like roof tiles. By this {{arrangement}} they effectively grip parts of the prey in synchronized waves like a conveyor <b>belt,</b> <b>transporting</b> it to the stomach, and the throat muscles promote this process. The three-toothed tip of the macrocilia is stiff enough for it to rip the outer wall of larger prey such as other ctenophores; at the same time, proteolytic enzymes penetrate into the resulting wounds, rapidly incapacitating the victim.|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Large {{quantities}} of commodities in different sizes <b>transported</b> on <b>belt</b> conveyors should often be mea-sured automatically {{by two or}} three conveyor belt scales. Continuous measurement can be dynamically performed by multi-stage conveyor belt scales, so that the masses of discrete objects on belt conveyors can be determined in sequence according to the different lengths. Belt conveyor scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 130 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minutes and more. The output signals from the multi-stage conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor and the object to be measured in motion. This measuring system consists of the three-stage conveyor belt scales with load-cells, and the photo-electro switches which detect the measuring lengths of the objects and distance between each object in sequence. The experimental results on the multi-stage conveyor belt scales suggest that the algorithms proposed in this paper are effective enough to practical applications...|$|R
