5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Scotland {{probably}} had about {{one quarter of the}} population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This was about four times the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed {{as a result of these}} trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and 1649–50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-cost}} net shape forging for demanding applications that {{are subject to}} {{a high degree of}} scrutiny, i.e. non-destructive testing by way of a dye-penetrant inspection technique, it is crucial <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> forging process disciplines be implemented. If the basic disciplines are not met, subsequent material removal operations will likely be necessary to remove material defects found at non-destructive testing inspection. Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E

25|$|Neural network {{research}} stagnated after {{machine learning}} research by Minsky and Papert (1969), who discovered two key {{issues with the}} computational machines that processed neural networks. The first was <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power.|$|E

25|$|Before the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} Roe v. Wade legalized abortion {{nationwide in}} 1973, {{it was already}} legal in several states, but the decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion must be legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). <b>That</b> <b>basic</b> framework, modified in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.|$|E

25|$|Further models {{studied the}} role of {{self-organization}} in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. Pierre-Yves Oudeyer developed models which showed <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals. These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.|$|E
25|$|Mutants & Masterminds game {{mechanics}} {{are based}} on the OGL d20 System, designed by Wizards of the Coast, however it is a highly modified version of <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> system. The largest differences pertain to character creation, injury and damage, and hit points, as well as the addition of Hero Points and, obviously, super powers. There are also numerous other differences such as the elimination of character classes and attacks of opportunity, a modified Skill list, a very different Feat selection, and the fact that any equipment possessed is considered a part of the character and purchased {{in a manner similar to}} powers.|$|E
25|$|Abahlali's {{original}} work was primarily committed to opposing demolitions and forced removals and to struggling for good land and quality {{housing in the}} cities. In most instances this {{takes the form of}} a demand for shack settlements to be upgraded with formal housing and services where they are or for new houses to be built close to where the existing settlements are. However the movement has also argued <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> services such as water, electricity and toilets should be immediately provided to shack settlements while land and housing in the city are negotiated. The movement has also engaged in the mass popular appropriation of access to water and electricity.|$|E

25|$|As well, many of Aristotle’s {{conclusions}} directly oppose {{those of}} twentieth century narratologists such as Vladimir Propp, who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not {{of human beings}} but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”. Propp also argues <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are {{defined in terms of}} a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in Poetics because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
25|$|In the United States in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, and {{prohibited}} {{the production of}} hemp in addition to cannabis. The reasons that hemp was also included in this law are disputed—several scholars have claimed that the act was passed in order to destroy the US hemp industry, with the primary involvement of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. But the improvements of the decorticators, machines that separate the fibers from the hemp stem, could not make hemp fiber a very cheap substitute for fibers from other sources because it could not change <b>that</b> <b>basic</b> fact that strong fibers are only found in the bast, the outer part of the stem. Only about 1/3 of the stem are long and strong fibers. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the purpose of}} developing the nylon was to produce a fiber {{that could be used in}} thin stockings for females and compete with silk.|$|E
