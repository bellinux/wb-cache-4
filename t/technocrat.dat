5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views.

40|$|Do {{the social}} and {{cultural}} specialists differ from the <b>technocrats</b> and other social classes with respect to their socio-political, cultural and economic preferences and behaviour? If they do, is this attributable to their level and field of education? The social and cultural specialists are assumed to form ‘new’ social class and the <b>technocrats</b> ‘old’ social class. A typical social class should differentiate itself with respect to moral attitudes, socio-political behaviour and lifestyle forms. To reveal whether these assumed classes are indeed typical classes, we have studied a variety of socio-political, cultural and economic preferences and behaviour of members of these social classes using the Family Survey of the Dutch Population (FSDP) 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2003. To unravel the net differences between {{the social and}} cultural specialists and the <b>technocrats,</b> we controlled for the field of study, the level of education and background factors. Taking these control factors into consideration, {{the social and cultural}} specialists differentiate themselves substantially from the <b>technocrats</b> in their socio-political and especially economic preferences and behaviour. With respect to their cultural preferences and behaviour, they do not differ significantly from the <b>technocrats.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The rise of <b>technocrats</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} salient changes that China and Mexico have {{experienced}} in the last two decades. This paper explores the following questions: Who are the <b>technocrats?</b> How do we explain the rise of the <b>technocrats?</b> What is the nature of these technocratic elites? How does expertise influence the distribution of power over policy and decision-making? What happens when experts have power? Does tactics of political ontrol change radically with the change of the new elites? What are the roles played by the elite in the process of democratization that is transforming political institutions in Mexico and China? This paper concludes that in both Mexico and Chin the <b>technocrats</b> played an important role in economic transformations and a supporting role in the course of slow and incremental political change, but they are not the determining factor in democratic transition. The most important change in the leadership in post-Mao China is the dramatic rise of the political elites with higher education, especially those majoring in science and engineering.

In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.

40|$|Dominant market {{theories}} analyze markets as ahistorical entities {{without the need}} for professional groups that manage crucial functions within them. This thesis, in contrast, approaches markets as historical systems that develop over time and that can be constituted in many different ways because of different historical trajectories. Different professional groups managing market routines, further, are seen as a crucial part of markets. Two concepts are introduced: “market architecture”, the specific way a market is constituted at a given time; and “market technocrats”, the seemingly disinterested third party functionaries that manage routines in markets and advocate changes in market architecture. The thesis argues that market <b>technocrats</b> exist because of uncertainty and lack of trust between market actors, and that they {{are an important part of}} how market architectures develop over time. It presents an analytical framework for understanding market <b>technocrats</b> and how they interact with and develop markets. Four different aspects of market <b>technocrats</b> are explored: the process of establishing market <b>technocrats</b> in market routines; the capture of the authority of market <b>technocrats</b> by other market actors; the expansionistic behavior of market technocrats; and the way changes in economic theory, as an important part of how economists with technocratic authority advocate market change, can help to explain changes in markets. These aspects are explored through four empirical papers: The Market Technocracy of Import Substitution: The Role of Asymmetric Information and The Swedish Seed Association 1880 – 1935; Limits of Market Technocracy: Swedish Fertilizer Research and the Crisis of Objectivity 1945 – 1960; Central Banks, and the Pursuit of Influence, Prestige, and Legitimacy: The Creation of the Nobel Memorial Prize; and From Market Engineering to Institutional Engineering: Reform Economics in Sweden 1950 – 2000. The results of the papers form the basis of a hypothetical narrative of how the role of market <b>technocrats</b> has changed during the 20 th century.

25|$|Sir Humphrey represents, in many ways, {{the perfect}} <b>technocrat.</b> He is pompous, arrogant, elitist and regards his less-well-educated {{minister}} with some contempt.

He genuinely believes that the Civil Service knows what the average person needs and is the most qualified body to run the country, the joke being not only that Sir Humphrey, as a high-ranking Oxford-educated Civil Servant, is quite {{out of touch with the}} average person but also that the Civil Service judges what is 'best for Britain' to be that which in actuality is best for the Civil Service. Jim Hacker, on the other hand, tends to regard what is best for Britain as being whatever is best for his political party or his own chances of re-election. As a result, Sir Humphrey and Hacker often clash.|$|E

Horst Bucholz had called Moltke too untrained and inexperienced to understand war planning, which prevented him from having a defence policy from 1906 to 1911; it was the failings of both men, that caused them to maintain a strategy that was doomed to fail. Foley wrote that Schlieffen and Moltke (the Younger) {{had good reason to}} retain Vernichtungsstrategie as the foundation of their planning, despite their doubts as to its validity. Schlieffen had been convinced that only in a short war was there the possibility of victory and that by making the army operationally superior to its potential enemies, Vernichtungsstrategie could be made to work. The unexpected weakening of the Russian army in 1904–1905 and the exposure of its incapacity to conduct a modern war was expected to continue {{for a long time and}} this again made a short war possible.
