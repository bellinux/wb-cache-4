500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers. During a radio {{broadcast}} in Honolulu, he enjoyed the opportunity {{to say hello to}} Rita ("Here's a great big radio hug, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> under the circumstances") and to his mother ("Love from me to you"). On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, a grand total of 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten." [...] It was a sentiment he would voice often in the following two months.|$|E
2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I can't give you another 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people. [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow night--to-morrow {{night it}} all begins!" [...] the youth continued. [...] "I must start with {{ready-made}} clothes. I'll get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> eat <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> drink wine, {{go to the}} music halls. To-morrow night." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} woman, {{when she had}} raised his head on a roll of damaged cotton, which served for a pillow, [...] "there's <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you," [...] he said, {{stepping}} down and retiring to the path, where he resumed the smoking of his pipe {{as he walked}} up and down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Na, then, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{for you is}} to put it by, to be {{sauce for}} the wild-duck the morn; for I think ye said ye were to bide here {{for a day or}} twa." ...|$|E

6000|$|Thornton {{rose to his}} feet. His {{eyes were}} wet. The tears were {{streaming}} frankly down his cheeks. [...] "Sir," [...] {{he said to the}} Skookum Bench king, [...] "no, sir. You can go to hell, sir. It's <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't do, Tallente," [...] he replied. [...] "We {{have had}} a meeting and decided to publish. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you is to promise that we will publish {{unabridged}} any comments {{you may have to}} make upon the matter, on the following day." ...|$|E
60|$|Yours received. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it is, {{to refer}} {{it to the}} War Department. The Rock Island case {{referred}} to, was my individual enterprise; and it caused so much difficulty {{in so many ways}} that I promised to never undertake another.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would rather}} {{go to some}} other place of {{confinement}} if I can,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'If not, <b>I</b> must make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> of that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is all I cam {{tell you}} of Mrs. Piper. I {{wish it were}} more [...] "scientific." [...] But valcat quantum! it is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> ma'am," [...] {{was all he}} said; {{and then}} drew the bow across the strings, as if eager to hear the dear notes again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Ralph," [...] she sobbed, [...] "it is very hard, but I {{know it is}} true. I {{have been}} just filled with vanity and pride, and after all I am nothing like as good as she is, nor as good as anybody, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to go back to}} school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will not," [...] {{says the}} man, [...] "for the covers will not hold ye. Not yet. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to enjoy ye meself, {{for the time}} is not ripe for {{destroying}} the limitations of print. Ye would look fantastic in type. All alone by meself must I drink this cup of joy. But, I thank ye, boys; I am truly grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{climb over}} me or go around, I don't care which," [...] murmured the lizard. [...] "When they're little, they're juicy; when they're big, there's more of 'em; but either way there's nothing so delicious as a parsnip. There are none {{here in the}} Fog Bank, so <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is dream of them. Oh, parsnips, par-snips, p-a-r-snips!" [...] He closed his eyes sleepily and resumed his dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll have to {{get along}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> without you, for I won't run away from a poor little baby, who counts on my findin' her folks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, I'll go {{back and}} do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to keep them in line, but Williams says the {{governor}} is entirely {{on the side of the}} mine-operators." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a rebuke in {{his final}} words, and she {{accepted}} it as such. [...] "I'll do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> Doctor," [...] she replied, {{and returned to her}} duty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{be glad to}} do {{something}} for ye," [...] said he; [...] "but then there's nowhar I could take ye. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to tell ye to go thar," [...] said he, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main street of the village. [...] "Go thar; they're kind folks. Thar's no kind o' danger but they'll help you,--they're up to all that sort o' thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Bacheller {{syndicate}} (117 Tribune Building) want a {{story of}} 5,000 words (lowest limit of their London agent) for $1,000 and offer to plank the check on delivery, and it was partly to meet that demand that I took that other holiday. So as I have no short story that suits me (and can't and shan't make promises), <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to offer the longer one which I finished on my second holiday--"Tom Sawyer, Detective." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the {{president}} of the company to come around personally and pay you your dividends on a silver platter," [...] Smoke sneered. [...] "No, sir. You fellows have got to be reasonable. Ten cents on the dollar will help start things. You buy two-fifths of the stock, hundred dollars par, at ten dollars. That's <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> And if you don't like it, just start jumping the claims. I can't stand more than a two-fifths gouge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easier {{said than}} done," [...] said the mate. [...] "The missis has got eyes like needles; still, I’ll do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for you. Look out! Here she comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the same}} with me, Sam. Nellie left to get married, and so did Cousin Dora, so I've got to do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for our family next June." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{take the}} job and do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for you," [...] said Munro Staton and arose to his feet. [...] "My hired man can run the farm while I am gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Barker!" [...] he said, and Lemuel {{lifted his}} head from the book he was reading. [...] "I have found {{something}} for you to do. I still prefer you should go home, and I advise you to do so. But," [...] he added, at the look that came into Lemuel's face, [...] "if you are determined to stay, this is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you. It isn't a full support, but it's something, and you must look about for yourself, and not rest till you've found full work, and something better fitted for you. Do {{you think you can}} take care of a furnace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Poplington came two {{or three}} days ago, and he is {{stopping}} at our hotel. We three have hired a carriage together {{two or three}} times and have taken drives into, the country. Once we went to an inn, the Cat and Fiddle, about five miles away, on a high bit of ground called Axe Edge. It {{is said to be the}} highest tavern in England, and it's lucky that it is, for that's the only recommendation it's got. The sign in front of the house has on it a cat on its hind-legs playing a fiddle, with a look on its face as if it was saying, [...] "It's pretty poor, but it's <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{for many}} reasons I would fain {{endeavor}} to tell my Oxford pupils some facts which seem to me worth memory about these six works of art; which, if they will reflect upon, being, in {{the present state of}} my health, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for them in the way of autumn lecturing, it will be kind to me. And as I cannot speak what I would say, and believe my pupils are more likely to read it if printed in the Nineteenth Century than in a separate pamphlet, I have asked, and obtained of the editor, space in columns which ought, nevertheless, I think, usually to be occupied with sterner subjects, as the Fates are now driving the nineteenth century on its missionary path.|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling, {{if there}} were a word to say, I would say it. I must be on the watch, and do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> At present <b>the</b> earth is too damp for mischief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{unfortunately}} Miss Norman is not here; and so I {{have to do}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> {{really must}} have some proof that I have fulfilled my trust. You see, Mr. Everard, though it is what lawyers call a [...] "friendly" [...] transaction, it {{is more or less}} a business act; and I must protect myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think of}} that," [...] Ralph laughed. [...] "Yes, the {{prospect}} is a cheering one. I promise you, O'Connor, that <b>I</b> will do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for you. Well, {{here we are}} alongside." ...|$|R
