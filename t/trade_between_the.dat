5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefitted from Denmark's {{neutrality}} during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of Højbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Dutch {{colonisation}} of the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), many people of Chinese descent were contracted as skilled artisans in the construction of Batavia on the northwestern coast of Java; they also served as traders, sugar mill workers, and shopkeepers. The economic boom, precipitated by <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> East Indies and China via the port of Batavia, increased Chinese immigration to Java. The number of ethnic Chinese in Batavia grew rapidly, reaching a total of 10,000 by 1740. Thousands more lived outside the city walls. The Dutch colonials required them to carry registration papers, and deported those who did not comply to China.|$|E

5|$|In short, the Rashtrakuta {{rule was}} {{tolerant}} to multiple popular religions, Jainism, Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. Buddhism too found support and was popular {{in places such}} as Dambal and Balligavi, although it had declined significantly by this time. The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara's Advaita philosophy. Islamic contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts, specifically in towns such as Kayalpattanam and Nagore. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappilas (Moplahs) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the port {{is closely related to}} the history of Constanța. Although Constanța was founded in the 2nd century AD the old Greek colony of Tomis was founded in the 6th century BC. The port-city was {{organised}} as an emporium to ease the <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Greeks and the local peoples. The Greek influence is maintained until the 1st century BC, when the territory between the Danube and the Black Sea was occupied by the Romans. The first years of Roman governorate were recorded by Ovid, who was exiled to Tomis for unknown reasons. In the next hundred years the port had a substantial development and the city changes its name to Constanța in honour of the Roman Emperor Constantine I.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Iron Age, {{there is}} much {{evidence}} for the use of horses in transport and battle, and for extensive <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast copper alloy cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. The horse was an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and myth, and is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Spanish territories and Spain. Because {{of the value of the}} goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E
