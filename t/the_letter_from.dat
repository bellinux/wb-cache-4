5|$|On November 21, the Boston Evening Traveller {{published}} an appeal by Schouler for contributions to assist soldiers' families at Thanksgiving which mentioned a widow {{who had lost}} five sons in the war.

In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life as she is unable to cope with her trauma and guilt any longer. She walks into a fire and is not seen again. At this point it is revealed that in Angela's version of Silent Hill the town is always on fire.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E

5|$|On March 23, the {{prosecution}} began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified {{the letters of}} complaint received against Rialto. Ernest H. Kastor, of a St. Louis advertising firm, testified that he introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902. Witnesses said that the agreement was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments. Dyer read into evidence <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Burton to Rialto.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} the next day, October 1, 2004, with his arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that she knows {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him and to leave.|$|E

Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} royal assent was at first signified by <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E

After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly.

Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it when he felt distressed.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted {{in the back of her}} neck. Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully removes the wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two removes <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> the mailbox.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality.

5|$|In 1743, Smart {{pushed his}} {{translation}} of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day as Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum {{and paid for}} the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's Essay on Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An Essay on Criticism (De Arte Critica) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.|$|E
5|$|The {{same month}} he {{returned}} home, {{he was awarded}} the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Trenchard confirming the King had bestowed this honour upon him was dated 30 March 1918. The award was gazetted on 29 March and the details were published on 2 April 1918. Shying away from this publicity, McCudden did not even tell his family of his attendance at Buckingham Palace on 6 April to receive his Victoria Cross from King George V and promotion to major. While on leave in London, he socialised a great deal with his friend Mick Mannock. He met C. G. Grey owner of The Aeroplane weeks later who offered to help McCudden finish his manuscript for his biography, Flying Fury, due for publication that year. McCudden accepted. Now famous, he also had his portrait painted by the known artist William Orpen.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would {{be viewed as}} intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if he voted against the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E

5|$|García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, {{his senior}} officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also {{accompanied}} by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition {{was approached by}} two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing {{him that he could}} advance safely. The port town of Ch'ich' was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel was {{believed}} to have come about from a cross of spaniels with the Black and Tan Terrier, which was cultivated by an unspecified Duke of Norfolk. However, later historians disagree with this theory, saying that the Duke of Norfolk's spaniels were of the King Charles type and that terrier stock {{had nothing to do}} with the origins of the Norfolk Spaniel. The theory of the Duke of Norfolk-based origins of the Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James Farrow, a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the origins of the breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{were outraged}} by {{the attack on the}} factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 Arab {{merchant}} ships at anchor in the harbor. Around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire. Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement. The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa. Moreover, the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish. The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices. The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>from</b> King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut, which was translated by the ruler's Arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of Arab traders. The Muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods, and attempted to sway the Hindu ruler against the Portuguese. The Portuguese and Arabs were extremely suspicious of each other's every action.|$|E
