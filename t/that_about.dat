5|$|A 2007 {{report found}} <b>that</b> <b>about</b> one-third of District {{residents}} were functionally illiterate, {{compared to a}} national rate of about one in five. This is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English. , 85% of D.C. residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language. Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006. D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $55,755; higher {{than any of the}} 50 states. However, 19% of residents were below the poverty level in 2005, higher than any state except Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|A 2013/4 {{survey by}} the National Association for Business Economics found <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 75 percent of those {{surveyed}} said ACA hadn’t influenced their planning or expectations for 2014, and 85 percent said the law wouldn’t prompt a change in their hiring practices. Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said that the act would have a harmful effect and 5 percent said it would be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely <b>that</b> <b>about</b> a third of the German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E

Rose had also radioed the American base at Queenstown with the approximate coordinates of the sinking before departing the area.|$|E
5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E

An earlier study predicted <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record.

5|$|Due to the hurricane's threat, workers fled oil {{platforms}} in the Gulf of Mexico, {{while the}} Coast Guard moved their boats inland.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved.

5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E

The Red Cross reported <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
