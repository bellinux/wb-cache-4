This topic is of great relevance for European Union which aims to stimulate a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in each of its region {{to come out of}} the actual crisis with the launch of a new set of territorial policies: the “Research and regional Innovation Strategies for the Smart Specialization”. This work deals with the inclusion of SMEs when implementing those RIS 3. We present several contributions to enhance a true involvement of SMEs within the RIS 3 dynamic. We highlight first the potentialities of the Collaborative Business Model dynamics as a suitable approach to support the collective participation of networks of SMEs in the definition of the RIS 3 orientations. Secondly we present the design of a collaborative platform called WeKeyInnovation (WKI), accessible online to share information about innovation <b>tools</b> <b>or</b> <b>devices</b> and which is progressively enriched by all the regional “entrepreneurs”. By collecting qualified empirical data WKI is designed to be a dynamic observatory of innovation processes within regional enterprises.

By being also a catalyst of regional “entrepreneurs” interactions, WKI facilitates the identification of potential partners and boost their adequate matching before to collectively engage in CBM processes.

40|$|Carbon nanotubes, a {{recently}} discovered form of carbon fiber with structural perfection {{similar to that}} of a fullerene molecule, have interesting electronic, chemical and mechanical properties due to their size and structure. Nanotubes have great potential as a bulk material for strong, lightweight composite materials, and as individual nano-scale <b>tools</b> <b>or</b> <b>devices.</b> Initial work on applications with individual multiwalled nanotubes as field emission sources and scanning force microscopy tips is described. The nanotubes display intriguing field emission behavior interpreted as the nanotube unraveling {{under the influence of the}} electric field. The unraveling process is believed to result in facile field emission from linear atomic carbon chains at the end of the nanotube. Such atomic wires represent an excellent field emitter. The work on multiwalled nanotube SFM tips was equally encouraging. The high aspect ratio of the nanotube allows it to image deep trenches inaccessible to commercially available Si pyramidal tips, and it reduces the interaction with the ambient water layer on the sample which perturbs image quality. The most remarkable advantage of nanotube SFM tips is a result of their mechanical properties. It was found that the nanotubes will remain rigid during normal imaging, but conveniently buckle to the side if circumstances arise which create large forces known to damage the tip and sample. This feature makes the tip more durable than Si tips, and is especially important for soft biological samples. In these two applications, as well as others, and in the measurements of novel nanotube properties, high quality, small diameter (0. 5 to 2 nm) diameter single-walled nanotubes are most interesting. Such material can be produced slowly and in small amounts by catalytic arc vaporization and catalytic laser vaporization of graphite. It is well known that nanotubes can be mass produced by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD), but the product consists only of large, defective multiwalled nanotubes. It has been found that the standard CCVD technique can be made to exclusively produce small single-walled nanotubes by lowering the concentration of reactants. It is shown that this change in product morphology is a result of a change in the rate limiting step of the CCVD reaction. Nanotube nucleation and growth termination are also studied for this CCVD system. Prospects for mass production of single-walled nanotubes by this modified CCVD technique are considered...|$|E

Instruments such as the astrolabe, the quadrant, and others were used to measure and accurately record the relative positions and movements of planets and other celestial objects. The sextant and other related instruments were essential for navigation at sea. Most instruments are used within the field of geometry, including the ruler, dividers, protractor, set square, compass, ellipsograph, T-square and opisometer. Others are used in arithmetic (for example the abacus, slide rule and calculator) or in algebra (the integraph).

40|$|The {{agricultural}} industry {{has not seen}} significant innovation in development of low-cost automated farming solutions, with current systems costing several {{thousands of dollars to}} implement. Currently these automated solutions are primarily implemented around crop planting and harvesting, and the large implementation cost of these systems makes them unfeasible for small-scale operations. Within many agricultural industries, workers expend a considerable amount of time undertaking simple tasks that are labour intensive. Many of these tasks could instead be completed using a self-driving robotic platform outfitted with the appropriate devices required for the tasks. This thesis covers the research work aiming to produce a solution that could turn an existing farming vehicle into a multipurpose low-cost agricultural platform, to act as the platform for an autonomous vehicle capable of performing pre-programmed tasks within an agricultural environment. A quad bike was selected as the vehicle platform for this research in which the control modules would control the speed and direction of this farm bike. Four modules were developed to control the vehicle components that would normally be operated by a human operator. These modules are comprised of mechanical actuators coupled with a microcontroller control system and includes some specific designs to maintain the user's ability to manually control the pre-existing systems. A gear-changing module controls the vehicles manual gearbox, providing a method to detect and control the vehicles current gear. A speed control module was developed to control the vehicles throttle and braking system and detects the vehicles speed. A steering module controls the vehicles steering system, allowing for accurate control of the vehicles direction. Finally, a vehicle controller module provides a central command interface that ties the previous three modules together and controls the vehicles electrical components and engine. Development of a low-cost differential GPS (DGPS) system was also undertaken to reduce the implementation cost of the system. Due to inconclusive results in relation to the positional accuracy of this system is was decided that a standard GPS system would be used for the vehicle prototype with further development on the DGPS system would be undertaken in future development of the research. The successful development of a farm automated vehicle platform was achieved through this research.

Thus, a dedicated <b>tool</b> <b>or</b> <b>device</b> such as a Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) is required in helping human to perform these research activities. This paper presents design and construction of ROV, which differ depending on its applications. Some of the ROV’s classifications include micro, mini, general, light work class, heavy work class and burial ROV. Therefore, it is essential to identify the design concept and the classification of a new proposed ROV for underwater application. Several main sub-modules need to be considered during the development of ROV, which include structured/ frame and fitting, control unit/CPU, monitoring system (camera), buoyancy and propulsion system. Each module needs to be properly designed so that the ROV can work as planned.

The concept of the three-dimensional contingency matrix is used as an initial point of model development.

A conceptual six-variables organization framework is proposed where the interrelationships among characteristics of the six variables and general capabilities of decision aiding systems are described by a series of IF [...] .

Finally, data are collected and a computer model based on artificial intelligence heuristics (production systems) is created to examine the consequences of various organization - DSS interactions.
