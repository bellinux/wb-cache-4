5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option <b>to</b> <b>update</b> <b>the</b> look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer <b>to</b> <b>update</b> <b>the</b> sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E

Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} something more.

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{managerial}} change from Burley to Freedman, the club announced plans to relocate the club back {{to the site of the}} Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, built on the club's original home, redeveloping it into a 25,000-seater, purpose-built football stadium. The following season started well, with a League Cup run that saw Palace beat Crawley Town, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and by late October the club were third in the league. A League Cup victory over Southampton set up a quarter final tie away at Manchester United. However league form began to slip and Palace went six games without scoring immediately prior to the match at Old Trafford. Entering the tie as the underdogs, a 35-yard free-kick from Darren Ambrose and an extra time header from Glenn Murray saw Palace win at Old Trafford for the first time in 22 years. The club then announced potential plans <b>to</b> <b>update</b> <b>the</b> image of the club through a new badge. On the pitch, league form remained patchy, and the semi-final of the League Cup ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Cardiff. Palace finished the season in seventeenth place, an improvement on the previous season.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 1981, Har Mar Mall {{was damaged}} {{by a large}} tornado during the {{afternoon}} hours. While the mall wasn't heavily damaged and only affected the mall's cosmetic appearance, several nearby local businesses and residences were left in ruins following the impact. Shortly after the tornado, a large renovation occurred <b>to</b> <b>update</b> <b>the</b> mall's appearance and fix any damage left by it. In 1988, another expansion took place, allowing Har Mar to acquire several larger retailers in the newly constructed space; the opening of Highland Superstore and TJ Maxx appeared later this year, along {{with the addition of}} a new food court with seating for over 400 people. Three years later, the Highland Superstore was converted to BizMart, a regional office supply store. BizMart was later acquired by OfficeMax in 1992 before ultimately closing in 1995; HomePlace opened in the space vacated by OfficeMax, and is currently leased by HomeGoods, the successor of HomePlace. In the 2000s, Har Mar underwent a cosmetic makeover that cost previous owner Emmes Realty Services nearly $12 million; Emmes sparked interest in opening a Von Maur at the center, but the proposal eventually dissolved.|$|E
