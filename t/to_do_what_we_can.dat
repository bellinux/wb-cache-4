It's been interesting for me, since the events of September 11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and {{talking to me about}} 'Never Too Far,' 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured {{that it would be a}} nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. ...

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on whether we can have reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I take as my starting point two papers recently published in Philosophical Studies, by Bart Streumer and Ulrike Heuer, which defend the two dominant opposing positions on this issue. Briefly, whereas Streumer argues that we cannot have reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Heuer argues {{that we can have}} reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when we can get closer to success but cannot have reason <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when we cannot get closer to success. In this paper, I reject both positions as they are presented, on the grounds that neither can accommodate an important category of reasons, which are the reasons to realise and to try to realise dimensions of value that lie at the boundary of what is realisable, specifically, genuinely valuable ideals. I defend a third view that we can have reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> even when we cannot, in Heuer's sense, get closer to success. Moreover, I argue that we can have reason to realise and to try to realise genuinely valuable ideals for their own sake and not simply for the sake of achieving mundane, realisable ends...|$|R

60|$|What are {{the uses}} of {{decisions}} of courts? They have two uses. First, they decide upon the question before the court. They decide {{in this case that}} Dred Scott is a slave. Nobody resists that. Not only that, but they say to everybody else that persons standing just as Dred Scott stands are as he is. That is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person it will be so decided again, unless the court decides another way, unless the court overrules its decision. Well, we mean <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to have the court decide the other way. That is one thing we mean to try to do.|$|E
60|$|It was {{certainly}} a good deed in Richard to liberate his mother from her captivity, and to exalt her as he did {{to a position of}} responsibility and honor. Eleanora fulfilled the trust which he reposed in her in a very faithful and successful manner. The long period of confinement and suffering which she had endured seems to have exerted a very favorable influence upon her mind. Indeed, it is very often the case that sorrow and trouble have this effect. A life of prosperity and pleasure makes us heartless, selfish, and unfeeling, while sorrow softens the heart, and disposes us to compassionate the woes of others, and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to relieve them.|$|E
40|$|How does {{it happen}} that our beliefs about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> cause us <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> believe we ought <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> This is <b>what</b> John Broome calls the "{{motivation}} question. " Broome’s {{answer to the}} motivation question {{is that we can}} bring ourselves, by our own efforts, <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> believe we ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by exercising a special agential capacity: the capacity to engage in what he calls enkratic reasoning. My aim is to evaluate this answer. In doing so, I shall focus on three core aspects of Broome’s overall account: his account of ought, his account of enkratic rationality, and his account of enkratic reasoning in particular. In each case I suggest there are problems...|$|R
