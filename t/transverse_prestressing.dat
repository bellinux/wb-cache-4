40|$|In the Netherlands, {{there is}} a need to {{determine}} the capacity of bridge decks as a large number of them were built back in the 60 ’s and 70 ’s. Since then, not only a lot of additional safety requirements have been incorporated into the modern codes but the traffic flow has also increased drastically. The current research deals with this question by taking into account arching action or compressive membrane action (CMA) in transversely prestressed decks on concrete girders. CMA is a phenomenon that occurs in deck slabs with edges restrained against lateral movement by stiff boundary elements. This restraint induces in-plane forces in the slab affecting both the flexural and the punching shear capacities. Existing methods were modified and a MATLAB program was developed to include the effect of CMA and the <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> to calculate the punching shear capacity of bridge decks. It was concluded that <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> enhances the CMA and improves the structural behaviour. However, detailed experiments are being carried out to further investigate the effect of different parameters, like geometry of the deck and the Transverse Prestress Level on the punching shear strength.

40|$|Introduction Many {{researchers}} have been discovered that bridge deck slabs which were designed to fail in bending, mostly fail under punching shear mode at a higher load than the expected for bending, because {{of the effect of}} in-plane compressive membrane forces, induced by the lateral restrained boundary conditions. Punching and bending failure modes are going to be analysed taken into account the enhancement due to compressive membrane action in the transverse prestressed concrete slab. Problem definition The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of compressive membrane action (CMA) in combination with the transversely prestress under a static point load applied at the midspan of the bridge’s slab. Research The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of the compressive membrane action and transversely prestress of the ultimate punching and bending capacity of a concrete deck slab. To develop the analysis of this scientific topic, research questions have been posed giving an orientation into the research and indicating the guiding components of the investigation. 1. Develop an analytical model to predict the ultimate capacity of a transversely prestressed slab accounting for the CMA and TPL. 2. To what extent can the CMA and the TPL contribute to the punching shear and bending capacity of the slab? 3. Comparative Study: Theoretical approach versus Experimental results Results – Conclusions Simulating the <b>transverse</b> <b>prestress</b> as an imposed strain, the punching capacity is hardly affected by the different prestress levels (1 % deviation) and the compressive membrane force slightly changes, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} theoretical approach underestimates the prestress. In flexural mode the bending capacity is higher than the punching shear leading to the conclusion that the slab will fail in punching shear. The ultimate capacity of the interior panel is higher than the exterior but the displacement is smaller because the higher stiffness of the interior makes it stiffer and less ductile. Recommendations 1. Prestress should be simulated as a progressing action until the failure stage, not as a constant effect. 2. Effective stiffness in punching shear has to account for the boundary conditions. 3. Compressive membrane action should be defined separately from the ultimate punching shear capacity.

Under overload vehicles, the concrete hinges of such bride are easily damaged, which usually causes single slab bearing and tremendously reduces the bridge’s load capacity. It is necessary to take some reinforcement measures to enhance the carrying capacity of such impaired bridge for traffic safety. In this paper, a field reinforcement experiment of an actual hollow slab bridge, which has experienced a destructive test with its transverse connections seriously damaged, was performed by applying external <b>transverse</b> and longitudinal <b>prestress</b> to it.

40|$|Performance of {{buildings}} and bridges during past earthquakes {{has indicated that}} many of these structures are vulnerable to seismic damage and structural collapse. The deficiencies in pre- 1970 s design codes have resulted in poor performance of reinforced concrete structures during seismic excitations. The Richter Magnitude 6. 6 - 1971 San Fernando Earthquake raised awareness for seismic retrofit needs of existing buildings for the first time. The majority of deficiencies of vulnerable concrete columns can be overcome through seismic retrofits that involve additional transverse reinforcement. This can be done either by providing reinforced concrete, steel, or fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets around existing columns; or by applying <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> to columns (RetroBelt System). The research project presented in this thesis involves a seismic retrofit methodology for seismically deficient building and bridge columns, utilizing the use of high-strength packaging straps as external reinforcement for <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing.</b> The emphasis in the project is placed on experimental research. Three seismically deficient full-size reinforced concrete columns, with a circular, a square and a rectangular cross- section, either critical in shear or flexure, were designed, built and tested under simulated seismic loading. The results indicate that external prestressing of columns in transverse direction with high-strength steel straps improves ductility and energy dissipation capacity of seismically deficient columns. They further indicate that current analytical techniques can be used to predict the force-displacement relationships of columns.

40|$|Performance of bridges {{during recent}} {{earthquakes}} has revealed inadequacies of pre- 1970 's designs, especially in concrete columns. The 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes in California, and the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, have demonstrated seismic deficiencies and resulting {{damage to a}} considerable number of major bridges. The deficiencies in bridge columns essentially stem from lack of properly designed transverse reinforcement, increasing their vulnerability to shear, confinement and reinforcement splice failures. The Structures Laboratory of the University of Ottawa has been active in developing new and effective seismic retrofit techniques. One such technique involves the <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> of concrete columns to improve concrete confinement, diagonal tension capacity and bond between steel and concrete in reinforcement splice regions. The technique, named as Retro-belt, has been verified through extensive experimental and analytical research on circular and square columns. However, questions remain in terms of its applicability to rectangular columns with a significantly different aspect ratio than square sections as well as its use as a repair technique. The objective of the current research effort is to extend the applicability of the Retro-belt technique to rectangular columns as well as explore the possibility of using it as a repair methodology. The research presented in this thesis consists of experimental and analytical phases. The experimental phase includes the tests of nine full-size bridge columns under simulated seismic loading. Three pairs of rectangular columns were designed, built and tested to extend the retrofit technique to rectangular columns. Three additional columns with circular, square and rectangular cross sections were designed and built as shear dominant columns to be damaged and repaired. They were damaged by initial loading, repaired by <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> and then retested to develop a repair methodology involving the Retro-belt technique. The analytical research was carried out to verify the applicability of existing design principles to columns that are transversely prestressed. Strength and deformability of columns computed by analytical means and recorded experimentally were compared to verify the analysis techniques. Design procedures were developed for retrofitting rectangular columns with shear, confinement and splice deficiencies. A repair design method was also proposed based on limited test data, to be further developed. The results indicate that pre- 1970 's columns suffer from lack of strength and deformability. Shear- and splice-deficient columns showed limited deformability of about 1 % drift ratio. Columns that lacked confinement and behaved predominantly in the flexure mode developed approximately 2 % lateral drift before they failed in a brittle manner. Those retrofitted by <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> showed improved deformability of approximately 4 % lateral drift, indicating the effectiveness of the Retro-belt techniques as a seismic retrofit methodology for rectangular columns. The application of <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> as shear repair techniques was explored through testing. The test results showed that the Retro-belt technique was effective in restoring shear strength of a damaged column and improving its deformability from 1 % to 4 % lateral drift. However, the technique, as applied in the current investigation, demonstrated only a limited improvement when used for repairing a splice-deficient column.

40|$|Incremental bridge {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the many}} ways in which a bridge can be constructed. In The Netherlands this method is not often used. This may be explained by the fact, that there are not many suitable locations for application of this method. Incremental bridge launching is profitable for long bridges and can only be used for straight bridges or when the superstructure has a constant horizontal and vertical radius throughout the length. However, when the preconditions for use of this method are met, incremental bridge launching can be a great solution for bridge design. Ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is a new concrete. In contrast to regular reinforced concrete, UHPFRC contains fibers to provide for the capacity that is necessary when the concrete is loaded in tension. However, as for incrementally launched bridges, its application is limited as of yet. One explanation for the reluctance to use the material, is that compared to regular concrete, the cost of production are many times higher. To make economical designs using UHPFRC, the high cost of production need to be recovered by material savings, when a structure is executed or during its lifetime. The aim of this thesis is to identify whether a superstructure designed in UHPFRC can increase the application range of incremental bridge launching in The Netherlands, and to explore whether the concept can compete with other bridge designs. In order to make a statement, a case study approach is used. It concerns the launch of the eastern approach bridge of the bridge over “Het Pannerdensch Kanaal”, designed in UHPFRC. The location suits incremental bridge launching perfectly, as there is a constant horizontal and vertical curvature in the alignment for over 550 meters. The most favorable cross-section for incrementally launched bridges is a box girder. A comprehensive analysis on the cross-sectional capacity of a prestressed box girder, designed with different concrete strength classes, is performed to optimize the shape. The design of a box girder takes a special procedure, where both the transverse and longitudinal directions are considered separately. Transverse bending moments and shear forces, due to mobile loading, are obtained with influence surfaces and the differential equation of the Euler-Bernoulli bending beam. For the longitudinal direction, a spreadsheet is developed to identify the bending moments and shear forces that occur during launch and service life. The force method for analysis of indeterminate structures is used to determine the governing bending moments for this multiple span bridge. Also, the sheet contains parts to determine the required amount of central and continuity prestressing and to optimize the length of the steel nose to reduce the peak moments during launch. The use of UHPFRC in the design of a structure requires a special approach. Requirements regarding quality control are strict and need to be prescribed to allow on-site production. The typical characteristics of UHPFRC have an important impact on the execution and production cycle of the incrementally launched bridge, which is therefore investigated. The case study is used to investigate the competitiveness of the design. Cost of production and execution are integrated into a price per cubic meter of concrete and compared to the design of The Zeeburgerbrug, which was launched and built with regular concrete. Efficient use of UHPFRC allows a light box girder design, which can be launched without auxiliary supports. Conventional and shear reinforcement are not necessary. <b>Transverse</b> and longitudinal <b>prestressing</b> provide sufficient bending moment capacity, while the fibers contribute to a huge shear capacity that is more than enough to withstand the shear forces. The required amount of central and continuity prestressing does not fit in the concrete cross-section. Therefore, all tendons are applied externally. The anchors and deviators will not fit in the concrete cross-section either. The cost comparison shows, that a lot of the higher cost of production of UHPFRC can already be compensated during the design and construction phases. The remaining part of the higher cost of production of UHPFRC need to be compensated differently, for instance by savings in maintenance cost due to better durability properties or by a lighter substructure, as we are able to generate proper savings in the amount of concrete for the superstructure. The case study proves that when the superstructure is considered only, it might be hard to design and execute the UHPFRC box girder more economically than the design of The Zeeburgerbrug. However, when we consider the total bridge over the entire service life, we might have a competitive design. Alternative bridge designs, that use different construction techniques should be developed to assess the competitiveness of the incrementally launched UHPFRC box girder for that location.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} facing the designers today is to investigate if the old bridges are still safe for modern traffic. The current research deals with this question by taking into account compressive membrane action (CMA) in determining the capacity of reinforced and transversely prestressed con-crete decks. CMA can significantly affect the flexural and punching shear strength of deck slabs but it is usually neglected for design and assessment purposes. Therefore, a flexural theory was used and a punching shear model was modified to fully utilize the effect of strength enhancement by CMA. Several experiments done by various researchers have been analysed by using these theories. It was concluded that considering CMA in the assessment shows that bridge decks can have a considerably larger shear capacity than assumed in the initial design. This is of high significance because in The Netherlands about 70 bridges have to be investigated, with very thin decks cast between the flanges of long prestressed beams. Using the actual design codes for the verification of the bearing capacity leads to values showing that the safety standards are not met. However, theoretical analyses show that nevertheless sufficient residual capacity might be available.

40|$|Bridges {{like other}} {{important}} lifeline structures must remain in service {{when they are}} subjected to strong earthquakes. Many existing bridges, especially those built before the 1970 s, are vulnerable to seismic damage since a number of deficiencies with regard to low design force levels, inadequate column confinement and lack of shear capacity were discovered during recent earthquakes. Bridge columns are expected to withstand seismically induced inertia forces without a significant loss of strength. This can be achieved in old columns through external retrofitting. Many reinforced concrete bridge columns in California were already retrofitted with steel jackets to enhance flexural ductility and shear resistance. Although this retrofitting technique is highly effective, it is also time consuming and costly, especially {{in view of the}} fact that high number of columns are yet to be retrofitted. Therefore, a new retrofitting technique has been developed through experimental research that involves external prestressing of bridge columns for improved deformability and shear strength. The supporting experimental work involved testing of 1485 mm high two 550 mm square and five 610 mm diameter circular cantilever columns. The columns were retrofitted with post-tensioned external hoops and high-strength steel straps at different spacing and stress levels. The results indicated that <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> of shear-dominant columns improved ductility and changed the mode of behavior from a brittle shear response to a ductile flexural behavior. The research project also included analysis of columns to establish lateral drift demands and capacities for bridge columns in Canada. A comprehensive survey of existing bridges in Canada was conducted to identify and classify common types of existing bridges in terms of their numbers, types, age, and structural and geometric properties. This information proved to be helpful in establishing column drift capacities and demands. A computer software DRAIN-RC, developed for non-linear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete structures, was used to determine the drift demands of columns under various ground motions. Drift capacities were computed by a computer program COLA, developed by the author. The program COLA uses proper material models such as confinement of core concrete, extension of longitudinal reinforcement in tension, and buckling of re-bars in compression. The decision for retrofitting depended on the capacity of a column when demand exceeded its capacity...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} made to study the shear transfer between precast prestressed beams and in-situ concrete in a relatively new method of construction of continuous bridge decks where the ends of precast beams are connected to an integral in-situ crosshead away from the supports. Two series of tests were carried out. In the first series 1 / 3 scale models of the M. o. T, C&CA M- 8 sections were used, and these were modified in the second series to study {{the effect of the}} beam's top flanges within the connection. One of the most important mechanisms of shear transfer proved to be the top flanges of the precast beam. For the precast beams with top flanges (first series), and with a 300 mm beam embedment length, it was discovered that: a) The shear force is transferred from a small length {{at the end of the}} beam. b) The in-situ concrete nibs (concrete surrounding the web) can take this shear force without stirrups. c) There is no need either to project all the bars from the precast into the in-situ concrete or to prestress the connection transversely as a means of improving shear transfer. d) It was possible to transfer the whole shear force at the connection with a reduced embedment length of 100 mm with nib stirrups. For the precast beam without top flanges, the transfer of the shear force at the connection required other improving details. In this respect <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> and web shear connectors were utilized effectively. The effect of projecting bars was also examined. In the general behaviour of composite continuous beams subjected to shear a detailed comparison was made between different Code predictions for the web cracking shear and web crushing strength. A mathematical model is also proposed to predict the stirrup stress according to shear span, effective depth and stirrup ratio when failure is controlled by web crushing. Stirrup stress measurement in the vicinity of continuous support made it possible to predict the enhanced shear strength and a design method is proposed for the continuous beams. A comparion is also made between different Code predictions in this respect. To obtain more information about the strength of web shear connectors used in the secod series, a separate dowel shear specimen was designed. Different interface conditions including bond, dowel bar size and strength and the effect of shrinkage were examined.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} questions that structural engineers {{all over the world are}} dealing with is the safety of the existing structures. In the Netherlands, there are a large number of transversely prestressed bridge decks that have been built in the last century and now need to be investigated for their structural safety under the actual (increased) traffic loads, for the rest of their service life. This research is an attempt to investigate the bearing (punching shear) capacity of such bridge decks under concentrated loads (wheel loads). Using the actual design codes for the verification of the bearing capacity leads to values suggesting that the safety standards are not met. However, since the bridge decks are laterally restrained by the supporting beams it is expected that compressive membrane action (CMA) exists in such deck slabs, and that the <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> of the deck slab in combination with CMA will enhance the bearing capacity, making thinner deck slabs possible with no problems of serviceability and structural safety. This thesis begins with an introduction to the research topic, listing briefly the background and the objectives, and concluding with the research strategy. A literature review regarding the punching shear capacity of transversely prestressed concrete decks and compressive membrane action has also been carried out. First, the general mechanism of punching shear and compressive membrane action is explained along with the relevant analysis methods and code provisions and then important experimental investigations done on prestressed deck slabs are briefly described. It is concluded that there is a need to investigate the bearing capacity of transversely prestressed concrete deck slabs supported by and connected to concrete girders using a large scale model since most of the past research is either done on concrete decks with steel girders or on small scale models. In order to investigate the research problem experimentally, laboratory tests on a 1 : 2 scale bridge model of a real bridge in the Netherlands have been performed. The model bridge consisted of a thin, transversely prestressed concrete deck (with unbonded tendons), cast in-situ between the flanges of long prestressed concrete girders. Prestressed transverse beams were also provided close to either end of the bridge deck. The interface between the deck slab and the girder flanges was either straight or skewed and two types of loads were applied: single and double. Loads were applied at midspan and close to the deck slab-girder flange interface. All the tests showed failure in punching shear (either brittle punching or flexural punching) regardless of the type and position of the load. Failure always occurred in the span of the slab, whereas the interface remained undamaged. The effect of various parameters, like the <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> level (TPL), the type and position of the load(s), the inclination of the joint (interface), the size of the loading plate etc., on the bearing capacity were also studied. As part of the numerical investigation, a 3 D solid, 1 : 2 scale model of the real bridge, similar to the experimental model, was developed in the finite element software DIANA and several nonlinear analyses were carried out. A comparison with the experimental results was made proving that satisfactory results were obtained that validated the finite element model. The normal forces arising from compressive membrane action were determined with the help of composed elements. A detailed parametric study was also carried out involving numerical modeling parameters, like the mesh size, displacement-load step size etc., and the material and geometrical parameters, similar to the experimental parametric study. In addition to that, the size effect was studied by carrying out a nonlinear analysis on a 3 D solid model of the real bridge, showing that a size factor of 1. 2 is appropriate to convert the results of the model bridge deck with 100 mm thickness to those for the real bridge deck with a thickness of 200 mm. A theoretical analysis of the model bridge deck was then carried out and it was demonstrated that the ultimate load carrying capacity as found from the experiments and the finite element analysis was much higher than predicted by governing codes and theoretical methods. The discrepancy was attributed to the lack of consideration of CMA in the theoretical approaches. In order to incorporate CMA in the analysis, the normal forces arising from compressive membrane action and determined via the finite element analysis were used in the fib Model Code 2010 punching shear provisions (based on the Critical Shear Crack Theory) to determine the ultimate bearing (punching shear) capacity. Calculations were performed at two Levels-of-Approximation (LoA); Elementary LoA (without CMA) and Advanced LoA (with CMA). Generally, it was observed that an increase in the TPL improved the behavior of the bridge deck with regard to both serviceability and ultimate limit state. An average safety factor of 3. 25 was obtained when the projected model bridge design capacity and the real bridge design capacity were compared with the design wheel load. It can be concluded that the existing bridges still have sufficient residual bearing capacity considering the beneficial effect of CMA. Moreover it was shown that appropriate nonlinear finite element models can predict the load bearing capacity quite accurately. The research described in this thesis, resulting in methods for the analysis of bridge decks including compressive membrane action, has the potential to result in considerable cost savings, since the models are able to demonstrate that many existing bridge decks are safe enough, contrary to earlier expectations. A proposal has been prepared to introduce the effect of compressive membrane action into the calculation models for punching shear offered in the fib Model Code for Concrete Structures 2010. To this end two more Levels of Approximation are added to the first three given already in the code. The new level IV enables the use of the Critical Shear Crack Theory in combination with the calculation of the curvature of the area around the concentrated load with a nonlinear finite element analysis using shell elements. The level V enables the prediction of the punching shear capacity with a tailored NLFE-program using composed elements. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Performance of bridges during {{previous}} earthquakes {{has demonstrated}} that many structural failures {{could be attributed to}} seismic deficiencies in bridge columns. Lack of transverse reinforcement and inadequate splicing of longitudinal reinforcement in potential plastic hinge regions of columns constitute primary reasons for their poor performance. A number of column retrofit techniques have been developed and tested in the past. These techniques include steel jacketing, reinforced concrete jacketing and use of <b>transverse</b> <b>prestressing</b> (RetroBelt) for concrete confinement, shear strengthening and splice clamping. A new retrofit technique, involving fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) jacketing has emerged as a convenient and structurally sound alternative with improved durability. The new technique, although received acceptance in the construction industry, needs to be fully developed as a viable seismic retrofit methodology, supported by reliable design and construction procedures. The successful application of externally applied FRP jackets to existing columns, coupled with deteriorating bridge infrastructure, raised the possibility of using FRP reinforcement for new construction. Stay-in-place formwork, in the form of FRP tubes are being researched for its feasibility. The FRP stay-in-place tubes offer ease in construction, convenient formwork, and when left in place, the protection of concrete against environmental effects, including the protection of steel reinforcement against corrosion, while also serving as column transverse reinforcement. Combined experimental and analytical research was conducted in the current project to i) improve the performance of FRP column jacketing for existing bridge columns, and ii) to develop FRP stay-in-place formwork for new bridge columns. The experimental phase consisted of design, construction and testing of 7 full-scale reinforced concrete bridge columns under simulated seismic loading. The columns represented both existing seismically deficient bridge columns, and new columns in stay-in-place formwork. The existing columns were deficient in either shear, or flexure, where the flexural deficiencies stemmed from lack of concrete confinement and/or use of inadequately spliced longitudinal reinforcement. The test parameters included cross-sectional shape (circular or square), reinforcement splicing, column shear span for flexure and shear-dominant behaviour, FRP jacket thickness, as well as use of FRP tubes as stay-in-place formwork, with or without internally embedded FRP crossties. The columns were subjected to a constant axial compression and incrementally increasing inelastic deformation reversals. The results, presented and discussed in this thesis, indicate that the FRP retrofit methodology provides significant confinement to circular and square columns, improving column ductility substantially. The FRP jack also improved diagonal tension capacity of columns, changing brittle shear-dominant column behavior to ductile flexure dominant response. The jackets, when the transverse strains are controlled, are able to improve performance of inadequately spliced circular columns, while remain somewhat ineffective in improving the performance of spliced square columns. FRP stay-in-place formwork provides excellent ductility to circular and square columns in new concrete columns, offering tremendous potential for use in practice. The analytical phase of the project demonstrates that the current analytical techniques for column analysis can be used for columns with external FRP reinforcement, provided that appropriate material models are used for confined concrete, FRP composites and reinforcement steel. Plastic analysis for flexure, starting with sectional moment-curvature analysis and continuing into member analysis incorporating the formation of plastic hinging, provide excellent predictions of inelastic force-deformation envelopes of recorded hysteretic behaviour. A displacement based design procedure adapted to FRP jacketed columns, as well as columns in FRP stay-in-place formwork provide a reliable design procedure for both retrofitting existing columns and designing new FRP reinforced concrete columns...|$|E
