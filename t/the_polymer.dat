5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into <b>the</b> <b>polymer</b> during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of <b>the</b> <b>polymer.</b> Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E

5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle.

Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw.

To better understand how water treatment parameters affect NDMA formation from <b>the</b> <b>polymers,</b> <b>the</b> effects of in situ chloramination, breakpoint chlorination, and pre-oxidation on the NDMA formation from <b>the</b> <b>polymers</b> were investigated. NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) as well as dimethylamine (DMA) residual concentration were measured from poly(epichlorohydrin dimethylamine) (polyamine) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (poly-DADMAC) solutions upon reactions with oxidants including free chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and monochloramine under different treatment conditions. The results supported that dichloramine (NHCl 2) formation was the critical factor affecting NDMA formation from <b>the</b> <b>polymers</b> during in situ chloramination. The highest NDMA formation from <b>the</b> <b>polymers</b> occurred near <b>the</b> breakpoint of chlorination.
