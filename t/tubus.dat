Friedrich had seen the dust and the manoeuvring of them, deeper in the Hills, from this same Fuchsberg yesterday, and inferred what was coming; calculated by what roads or hill-tracks they could issue: and how he, in each case, was to deal with them; his march-routes are all settled, plank-bridges repaired, all privately is ready for these proud Austrian musical gentlemen, here in the hollow. Friedrich has been upon this Fuchsberg with his <b>TUBUS</b> daily, many times since Monday last: it is our general observatorium, says Stille, and commands a fine view into the interior of these Hills. A Fuchsberg which has become notable in the Prussian maps: [...] "the Stanowitz Fuchsberg," [...] east side of Striegau Water,--let no tourist mistake himself; for there are two or even three other Fuchsbergs, {{a mile or so}} northward on the western side of that Stream, which need to be distinguished by epithets, as the Striegau Fuchsberg, the Graben Fuchsberg, and perhaps still others: comparable to the FOUR Neisse rivers, three besides the one we know, which occur in this piece of Country! Our German cousins, I have often sorrowed to find, have practically a most poor talent for GIVING NAMES; and indeed much, for ages back, is lying in a sad state of confusion among them. Many confused things, rotting far and wide, in contradiction to the plainest laws of Nature; things as well as names! All the welcomer this Prussian Army, this young Friedrich leading it; they, beyond all earthly entities of their epoch, are not in a state of confusion, but of most strict conformity to the laws of Arithmetic and facts of Nature: perhaps a very blessed phenomenon for Germany in the long-run.|$|E

40|$|Die fiberoptisch assistierte endo{{tracheal}}e Intubation durch die Larynxmaske ist ein sicheres Verfahren, um beim pädiatrischen Patienten mit unerwarteter sowie auch bei bekannter schwieriger Intubation den Atemweg einfach und zuverlässig zu sichern. Die Methode stellt eine Standardtechnik in der Atemwegssicherung dar; sie muss einerseits Bestandteil der klinischen Ausbildung sein und andererseits regelmäßig trainiert werden. Das Entfernen der Larynxmaske über den Endotrachealtubus wird durch dessen kurze Länge erschwert bzw. der Endotrachealtubus kann dabei sehr leicht aus der Trachea dislozieren. Nebst einer Vielzahl von Techniken, die Larynxmaske sicher über den Endotrachealtubus zu entfernen, bietet der Cook Airway Exchange Catheter in der Kinderanästhesie eine einfache Methode, nicht nur die Larynxmaske sicher über den <b>Tubus</b> zu entfernen, sondern anschließend auch den geeigneten <b>Tubus</b> einzuführen. Dies ist insbesondere bei gecufften Tuben wünschenswert, bei denen der Pilotballon des gecufften <b>Tubus</b> zu groß ist, um Larynxmasken der Größen 2, 5 und kleiner zu passieren. Die vorliegende Arbeit zeigt schrittweise die fiberoptisch assistierte endotracheale Intubation durch die Larynxmaske beim Kind und diskutiert ihre Bedeutung. Eine Liste mit aufeinanderabgestimmten Größen von Larynxmasken, Endotrachealtuben und Airway Exchange Cathetern ist ebenfalls enthalten. = Fibre optic-assisted {{tracheal intubation}} through the laryngeal mask airway {{is a simple}} and safe procedure for securing the airway in the paediatric patient with unexpected and known difficult tracheal intubation. Therefore, fibre optic-assisted tracheal intubation through the laryngeal mask airway represents a standard airway technique and {{must be part of}} clinical education and also regular training. However, the removal of the laryngeal mask airway over the tracheal tube is impaired by the short length of the tracheal tube, easily resulting in tube dislocation from the trachea. Among several techniques to overcome this problem, the Cook airway exchange catheter offers a reliable method not only for safe removal of the laryngeal mask over the tracheal tube but also for insertion of an adequate tracheal tube, particularly in paediatric patients. This is particularly important for cuffed tubes as the pilot balloon of the cuffed tube is too large to pass through laryngeal mask airway tubes size 2. 5 and smaller. This presentation demonstrates fibre optic-assisted tracheal intubation through the laryngeal mask airway in children step-by-step and discusses its clinical implications. A list with compatible sizes of laryngeal mask airways, tracheal tubes and airway exchange catheters is also provided...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} work is to present our {{preliminary}} results {{for the use of}} the Weerda distending diverticuloscope (W DD) for diagnostic and surgical interventions in patients with upper airways and digestive system disorders, especially of malignant origin. Material and methods: For the 2 -years period 2008 - 2009 the W DD was used in 21 patients. Under general anesthesia and protection of the front teeth the W DD is introduced, following the course of the endotracheal <b>tubus.</b> By adjusting the blades of the instrument very good exposition of the whole larynx and partially of the hypopharynx are achieved. Results: In 15 of the 21 cases the W DD allowed for optimal visualization of the region of interest. In 12 / 15 patients exploratory examinations with biopsies were performed. In 2 / 15 cases complete resection of carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall was performed. In 1 / 15 cases arytenoidecomy was performed. In 6 / 21 cases we were unable to introduce the instrument because of anatomical factors. Conclusion: The W DD presents a versatile tool for better exposing the laryngeal and hypopharyngeal regions. It is a valuable complement to the standard surgical armament of the ENT H&N surgeon, which gives new promissing diagnostic and treatment options...|$|E
40|$|Within the remit of the {{activities}} of the Emergency MedicalServices (EMS), there are occasions when it is hard to position the head of the patient in an adequate position for endotracheal intubation. Pre-hospital trauma life support suggests the „face-to-face ” intubation method in these situations. In patients with injuries sustained in accidents, this method is recommended prior to the removal of the patient from the vehicle; in this case, the patient is placed in the seated position. The „face-to-face ” method of intubation and its application. For this method of intubation and its application, at least two members of the EMS team are required, with the medical technician conducting manual head and neck stabilisation into a neutral position, while the practitioner prepares for the so-called “face-to-face ” position with the patient. Initially, the practitioner is to grip the handle of the laryngoscope firmly in their right hand while keeping the top of the blade in the upright position (contrary to normal intubation technique). Upon opening the respiratory passage in the patient with the left hand, the practitioner is to position the laryngoscope blade in the patient’s mouth, press the tongue slightly downward together with the lower jaw, and move the blade up and forward to produce epiglottal visualisation. The endotracheal <b>tubus</b> is then applied with the left hand between the patient’s glottis, to the desired depth. After intubation, the cuff is to be inflated with air by syringe. The third member of the team, if present, connects an Self inflating bag to the ET tube and checks the whole is correctly arranged. The „Face-to-face ” intubation method is the ideal way of providing and maintaining airways in patients with trauma, and is often crucial to their survival. Anestezjologia i Ratownictw...|$|E
40|$|Backround: Patients {{with acute}} {{respiratory}} failure often require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) means ventilation without an artificial airway – endotracheal <b>tubus</b> or tracheostomy canulla. The benefit of NIV is in avoiding {{the need for}} endotracheal intubation and its comorbidity, reducing morbidity, mortality and duration of hospitalisation and in its cost effectivness. Methods: At the surgical intensive care units of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana we analysed the treatment of acute postoperative respiratory failure with NIV and compared our results with world literature. Results: The retrospective study included 71 patients with acute postoperative respiratory failure, 39 male and 32 female, mean age 70 years. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure was observed in 29 (40 %) patients, hypercapnic type in 42 (60 %) patients. With CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) masks, and with helmets in 18 cases, we improved respiratory insufficiency in 46 (65 %) patients. During treatment the percentage of inhaled oxygen was gradually reduced. Carrico index (PaO 2 / FiO 2) was significantly greater (before NIV 158 ± 91, after NIV 239 ± 95, p = 0, 05) and PaO 2 raised from 9, 2 ± 2, 5 kPa to 11, 7 ± 3, 3 kPa (p = 0, 05). The values of PaCO 2 fell insignificantly (p = 0, 46). 25 (35 %) patients were intubated and transported to an intensive therapy unit. Conclusions: NIV {{has proven to be}} an effective therapy in patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure in strategy to reduce intubation rates with entailed comorbidity, the duration of hospital stays as well as morbidity and motrality rates. Our results with NIV therapy in postoperative respiratory failure were successfull in 65 %, and are comparable with results from literature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of defensive techniques against the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) with a primary focus on pheromone traps and selected factors affecting their efficacy. The factors tested are the setup system of pheromone traps and type of pheromone dispenser baits, {{the effect on the}} efficacy of pheromone traps of increasing evaporated pheromones, a comparison of the biological efficacy of different types of pheromone dispensers and an assessment of their impact on the swarming curve. In addition, an evaluation of non-traditional methods of forest protection against the spruce bark beetle (water spraying of whole landings, efficacy of insecticidal sraying of whole landings, and the use of insecticidal nets) was conducted and the possibility of the spruce bark beetle s sex determination was also examined. When comparing the systems of pheromone traps installation, (1) the standard way was along the stand edge with 20 m space and (2) traps concentrating in the centre of clear cut adjacent to each other with different baiting, the most effective way was found to be the standard trap arrangement and the system with traps installed in line with the dispenser in each pheromone trap. Efficacy decreased with a lower number of pheromone dispensers. The influence of increased amounts of evaporated pheromone on efficacy was tested. Pheromone traps with one, two or three dispensers were compared and it was found that a trap s efficacy was not increased with a higher amount of released pheromone. The Pheagr IT and IT Ecolure <b>Tubus</b> dispensers showed unchanged effectivity throughout the flight activity of spruce bark beetle, but other dispensers need to be replaced according to the instructions since their efficacy decreases, thus affecting the swarming curve. Trying to determine the sex of the spruce bark beetle by selected morphological parameters shows that the gender can only be reliably determined by an autopsy of genitals...|$|E
