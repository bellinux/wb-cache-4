5|$|Fort Runyon {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon, a native of New Jersey who {{commanded}} {{one of the first}} brigades of volunteers from that state. Later named commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia, he led that force into the First Battle of Bull Run, and served as commander for the first <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. In 1864, he was elected mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and was later named the U.S. Ambassador to Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> awards, actresses were {{nominated}} {{as the best}} in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.|$|E
5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} {{seats to}} hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election {{to hold a}} total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed in the <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second Fisher government exceeded even {{the output of the}} second Deakin government over a similar period. The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, and was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.|$|E

A Shelby County, Tennessee, court {{permitted}} her {{to participate in a}} pre-trial diversion program that expunged the felony charges from her record. She has denied the theft and claimed that it was a co-worker who stole the items from her workplace. Trenyce attended the University of Memphis on a full music scholarship.

5|$|Christopher Columbus {{discovered}} the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into {{contracts with the}} Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues {{and the power to}} rule. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the king of Spain via the Council of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Designed in {{the early}} 1930s, {{it was one of}} the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in the first <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, {{operating}} in the Condor Legion in various roles. Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939–1940. The Dornier was used throughout the early war, and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941, when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited.|$|E

5|$|In 1796, after <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolutionary Wars, Spain and the French Republic {{signed the}} Treaty of San Ildefonso. The secret {{terms of this}} treaty {{required}} Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally. In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced {{with the threat of}} attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east. Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796, controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795, and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral for the first <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. Tensions with Germany {{came to a head}} in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E

Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice with Germany signed in November. With the war over, the Virginias were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.|$|E

It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza. The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. Desks had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on voluntary contributions from the populace.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{maintained}} a cordial relationship with Wilson. The former president privately criticized his successor {{on a number}} of issues, but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy. Taft was appalled when, after Justice Lamar's death in January 1916, Wilson nominated Brandeis, whom the former president had never forgiven {{for his role in the}} Ballinger–Pinchot affair. When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis, Taft intervened with a letter signed by himself and other former ABA presidents, stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis. Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered; they met only once in the first <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wilson presidency, at a funeral at Yale. They spoke only for a moment, politely but formally.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
