25|$|Other early {{theories}} of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control {{of behavior and}} <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.|$|E

There were concerns that the lack of funds would be compensated for by financially crippled families or some computers left in boxes, unopened. The states were noncompliant upon learning that each would have to contribute up to A$3billion altogether, a contribution that was not mentioned by Rudd or Gillard in the election campaign.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{while doing}} {{unrelated}} archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her 40 {{years of research}} on Peirce the mathematician and scientist, culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and historian of ideas Max Fisch (1900–1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce; Fisch (1986) includes many of his relevant articles, including a wide-ranging survey (Fisch 1986: 422–48) {{of the impact of}} Peirce's <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> 1983.|$|E

25|$|Human reason {{requires}} more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire {{would have to be}} <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.|$|E
25|$|A {{difficulty}} {{encountered in}} the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential {{in order to make a}} machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.|$|E
25|$|With the {{discovery}} of recombinant DNA by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to Science suggesting that {{the consequences of this}} work were so potentially destructive {{that there should be a}} pause until its implications had been <b>thought</b> <b>through.</b> This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, Asilomar. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines were established.|$|E

25|$|The Jivamukti Yoga {{method of}} {{meditation}} is a mantra form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus. The mantra “Let-Go” is taught to all Jivamukti students, {{and provides the}} focus. The practitioner is instructed to align the silent repetition of the mantra with the incoming and outgoing breath. By witnessing the continuous movement of breath through the body and <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> the mind, Jivamukti teaches that the practitioner can eventually let go of identification with the body and mind and come to realize the supreme Self. The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment {{to be the ultimate}} goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction and then about 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q session with the teacher, and a final closing.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{uncontrolled}} public {{decisions have}} led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes {{the rule of law}} by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully <b>thought</b> <b>through,</b> which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority {{to face up to the}} people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.|$|E
25|$|Three major {{elements}} of the writing style indicate that the book can be classified as a psychological novel. The first is the emphasis {{of the mind and}} inner thoughts rather than the plot line and movement of the story. The feelings behind all actions chosen are far more important than the actions themselves; the actions are mere secondary behaviors in response to the psychological decisions of the character. Another element is the stream of consciousness, or inner monologue style of writing. The majority of the storyline takes place {{in the mind of the}} lead character rather than externally through actions and interactions with other characters. In addition to inner monologues, memories of dialogues or even imagined dialogues with other important characters aid in plot movement. The final element is the use of a non-chronological timeline and excessive flashbacks. The effect allows the reader to follow the character thought by <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> memories, feelings, and contemplations, thus creating the illusion that the reader is inside the character's mind, rather than a third party observer, as in classical novels.|$|E

500|$|Following his retirement, Cross {{attacked}} US {{foreign policy}} on Iraq, calling the plans [...] "fatally flawed" [...] shortly after General Sir Mike Jackson—Chief of the General Staff {{at the time}} of the invasion and also recently retired—called the same plans [...] "intellectually bankrupt". In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was over.

500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that this was just a joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he said there had been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E
500|$|In {{hopes of}} winning over the opposition, Hitler {{arranged}} meetings in Munich {{with the three}} Greater Ruhr Gau leaders, including Goebbels. Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally. The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them. Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: [...] "I love him... He has <b>thought</b> <b>through</b> everything," [...] "Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius." [...] He later wrote: [...] "Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius." [...] As {{a result of the}} Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.|$|E
500|$|On 30 July the Executive Council {{approved}} {{the suspension of}} the levy for two years, from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2010. After widespread criticism, the government said that maids with advanced contract renewals would {{not be required to}} leave Hong Kong; employers would benefit from the waiver by renewing contracts within the two-year period. According to the government, some employers could benefit from the waiver for up to four years. The effect of turning a two-year moratorium into four-year suspension was denounced by newspapers across the political spectrum, and the levy itself was called [...] "farcical" [...] in a South China Morning Post editorial. Stephen Vines wrote: [...] "The plan for a two-year suspension of the levy... provides an almost perfect example of government dysfunction and arrogance", and Albert Cheng said that the controversy exposed [...] "worst side of our government bureaucracy". Columnist Frank Ching criticised senior officials for living in ivory towers, and said that {{there would have been no}} disruption if the government had suspended payment immediately and repaid those who had prepaid. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor called for the levy's permanent abolition, saying that the temporary two-year waiver was discriminatory and criticising the confusion and inconvenience caused to employers by the Immigration Department because the policy had not been <b>thought</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
