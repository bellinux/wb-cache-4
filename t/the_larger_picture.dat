500|$|In 1925, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co {{published}} Childe's second book, The Dawn of European Civilisation, {{in which}} he synthesised the varied data about European prehistory {{that he had been}} exploring for many years. An important work, it was released when the few archaeologists across Europe were amateur and focused purely on studying their locality; The Dawn was a rare example that looked at <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>picture</b> across the continent. Its importance was also {{due to the fact that}} it introduced the concept of the archaeological culture into Britain from continental scholarship, thereby aiding in the development of culture-historical archaeology. Childe later stated that the book [...] "aimed at distilling from archaeological remains a preliterate substitute for the conventional politico-military history with cultures, instead of statesmen, as actors, and migrations in place of battles." [...] In 1926 he published a successor, The Aryans: A Study of Indo-European Origins, exploring the theory that civilisation diffused northward and westward into Europe from the Near East via an Indo-European linguistic group known as the Aryans; with the ensuing racial use of the term [...] "Aryan" [...] by the German Nazi Party, Childe avoided mention of the book. In these works, Childe accepted a moderate diffusionism, believing that although most cultural traits spread from one society to another, it was possible for the same traits to develop independently in different places, a theory at odds with the hyper-diffusionism of Sir Grafton Elliot Smith.|$|E
500|$|Established by 1967 as {{a critic}} for the seminal US music {{magazine}} Crawdaddy!, Pearlman was also the mentor, manager and producer for the band Soft White Underbelly, which, after various changes of name, became Blue Öyster Cult, a term taken from the Imaginos script. The adapted and amended rhymes of Pearlman, along with his friend and colleague Richard Meltzer's arcane writings, were used as lyrics {{for most of the}} band's early songs; musician and writer Lenny Kaye recalls in his introduction to the re-mastered edition of their first album that [...] "the band kept a folder full of Meltzer's and Pearlman's word associations in their rehearsal room, and would leaf through it, setting fragments to music". Fragments of the Imaginos script are scattered out-of-context throughout the songs of the first four albums, where the original meanings are lost to listeners unaware of <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>picture.</b> The resulting mystery feeds fan fascination for the music of Blue Öyster Cult, and is responsible for their reputation as [...] "the world's brainiest heavy metal band". Much fan speculation centers around lyrics' relationship to the Imaginos storyline, while Pearlman's deliberate reticence and misleading in revealing his sources only augments the obscurity of the matter. During the band's first period of activity, the theme of the alien conspiracy became more defined and predominant in the mind of its author, to the point that notes on the cover of their 1974 album Secret Treaties referred to the secret history conceived by Pearlman, while its songs [...] "Astronomy" [...] and [...] "Subhuman" [...] contained lyrics fully dedicated to the Imaginos plot.|$|E

[...] Once the Spanish threw their army into the fray, the balance of military force shifted rapidly to the Catholic side. [...] The loss of the archbishopric of Cologne to the Catholic contender, Ernst of Bavaria, resulted in the consolidation of Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories, the Jesuit-run establishment of a Catholic Counter-Reformation stronghold on the lower Rhine, and the consolidation of Spanish bridgeheads on the Rhine river, via which Philip of Spain could assault the Protestant Dutch provinces.|$|E

Speaking on the changes, the artist commented, “It made the work more up to date…but the irony is that this project didn’t have to change much.” [...] Wodiczko cited the locations, Boston and New York, as sufficient to garner different readings of the work. “The works in Boston and New York have different publics. New York’s character and the [...] shows gave Out of Here a big international audience as opposed to the more local audience in Boston.” Collectively, these narratives paint a picture of the individual veterans who told them, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>picture</b> of the Iraq War, and the more subtle clues to the war’s repercussions.|$|E

Dean said about the film's accuracy: [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>picture,</b> it reflected accurately what happened." [...] Stone addressed the criticism of fictional material in the film, saying, [...] "The material we invented was not done haphazardly or whimsically, {{it was based on}} research and interpretation." [...] John Taylor, head of the Nixon Presidential Library, leaked a copy of the script to Richard Helms, former Director of the CIA, who threatened to sue the production. In response, Stone cut out all scenes with Helms from the theatrical print and claimed that he did for [...] "artistic reasons" [...] only to reinstate this footage on the home video release.|$|E
2500|$|Whereby {{religion}} is an institutional mechanism, spirituality {{is a personal}} one. Unlike religion, spirituality cannot be abandoned or switched. It is an integral component of one's consciousness. Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, it envisions <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>picture</b> and exists to solve problems and end injustice. Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African American faith and life. She explains {{that it is not}} grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment." [...] In a blaze of glory: womanist spirituality as social witness. Nashville: Abingdon Press. One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation paints the picture of spiritual black womanists being [...] "church going" [...] women that {{play a vital role in}} the operation of the church. In William's article Womanist Spirituality Defined she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual's experiences with God. For instance, Williams declares, [...] "the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and the way in which we relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences". However, this connotation is disputed in Monica Coleman's Roundtable Discussion: [...] "Must I Be a Womanist?" [...] where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism. This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies. Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, [...] "Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field". Here Coleman explains that the majority of womanists have painted the spiritual aspect of womanism to be spiritual in terms of Christianity. A specific example of this occurs in Walker's [...] "Everyday Use", in the instance when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, [...] "When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. Just like when I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout". This could be categorized as an example of the spiritual aspect of womanism because of the mention of relation to the Christian God. However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption when she states: [...] "How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?" [...] Here Coleman pokes a hole in the pre-conceived notions of womanist scholarship. Coleman believes that the notorious sector of spirituality that womanism is most known for referring to is limited in its scope. Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and represent and support radical womanist spirituality. Considering womanism as a whole, it is also important to understand how it relates to feminism.|$|E
