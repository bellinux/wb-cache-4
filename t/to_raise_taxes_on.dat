5|$|In 1956, {{the party}} adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, {{a far more}} {{moderate}} proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto. For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E

25|$|Tensions between Gregory and the {{imperial}} court began around 722, when emperor Leo III attempted <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the papal patrimonies in Italy, draining the Papacy’s monetary reserves. Leo required this revenue {{to pay for}} the ongoing Arab war, while Gregory needed it to provide local foodstuffs for the city of Rome, thereby relieving Rome on its reliance upon the long-distance supply of grain. The result of which was, through refusing to pay the additional taxes, Gregory encouraged the Roman populace to drive {{the imperial}} governor of Rome from the city, and Leo was unable to impose his will upon Rome, as Lombard pressure kept the exarch of Ravenna from fielding an army to bring the pope to heel.|$|E

25|$|When Japanese {{funding for}} the army diminished, Bose was forced <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the Indian populations of Malaysia and Singapore. When the Japanese were {{defeated}} at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in its Burma campaign, notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, {{with the fall of}} Rangoon, Bose's government ceased to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrendered under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan's surrender {{at the end of the}} war also led to the surrender of the remaining elements of the Indian National Army. The INA prisoners were then repatriated to India and some tried for treason.|$|E

Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> other tobacco products.|$|E

30|$|A {{discussion}} on aggregate demand policy cannot escape {{the problem of}} {{where to find the}} necessary financial resources and therefore also deciding on the instruments to fight tax evasion and elusion or conducting an in-depth spending review. It is clear that the European Parliament should elaborate on criteria to implement an effective spending review both at the EU level and at the country level in order to free public resources for the implementation of the EYG. Labor income earners – the working and middle class – already pay too many taxes and need alternatives <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> them <b>to</b> support social expenditure. Otherwise, it becomes a vicious circle which will quickly put our democracies under threat, like the last Italian political elections suggest.|$|R

Louisiana has since been obligated <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> businesses because the unemployment trust fund had dropped below the prescribed threshold. Louisiana was set to receive about $3.8 billion overall. Jindal intends to accept at least $2.4 billion from the stimulus package.

[...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's Fact Checker to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, he did not want <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> oil companies. Romney's chief energy advisor also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of {{the oil and gas industry}} that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers.

On May 17, Corwin's campaign announced that Corwin would consider alternatives to the Ryan voucher plan, if they would help keep Medicare solvent. Corwin called her Democratic opponent's proposals <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the wealthy an attack on those [...] "who help our jobs grow and who will keep Medicare from going into bankruptcy", and has said that the Democrats, including Hochul, have offered no alternative to the Republicans' voucher plan.|$|E

40|$|When {{government}} needs more revenue than {{is available from}} a pollution tax rate equal to marginal environmental damage, our intuition tells us <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the clean good above zero and <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the dirty good above that first-best Pigouvian rate. Yet new {{results suggest that the}} second-best pollution tax is below the Pigouvian rate. This note reconciles these views by pointing out that these new results use a labor tax to acquire additional revenue, and that the labor tax is equivalent to a uniform <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> both clean and dirty goods. Thus, depending on the normalization, the total <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the dirty good can be above the Pigouvian rate. These recent results are meant to show that the difference between the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the dirty good and the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the clean good is less than the Pigouvian rate. Any one tax rate can be set to zero as a conceptual matter, but implementation of some taxes might be easier than others as a practical matter. ...|$|R

2500|$|Early in his term, Bush {{faced the}} problem {{of what to do}} with {{leftover}} deficits spawned by the Reagan years. At $220billion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times its size since 1980. This financial situation severely limited the President's ability to enact major domestic programs. The federal government did not have the revenues for any large, new domestic ventures, nor did the political climate lend itself to enacting them. To compensate for these constraints, Bush stressed [...] "a limited agenda," [...] that included volunteerism, education reform, and anti-drug efforts. Having pledged during the campaign not to raise taxes, the President found himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the budget and reduce the deficit without imposing additional taxes on the American people. He also faced a Congress controlled by the Democrats. Although Republicans thought that the government should approach the budget deficit by drastically cutting domestic spending, the Democrats wanted <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the richest Americans. Budget negotiations for the 1991 fiscal year proved especially contentious and problematic. Bush had no choice but to compromise with Congress, and his administration entered into lengthy talks with congressional leaders. Bush issued a written statement to the press, reneging on his 1988 [...] "no new taxes" [...] campaign promise, noting that tax increases might be necessary to solve the deficit problem.|$|E
