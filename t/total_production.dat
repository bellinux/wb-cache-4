5|$|All {{production}} aircraft were flight tested before delivery. During the Second World War, Jeffrey Quill was Vickers Supermarine's chief test pilot, {{in charge of}} flight-testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine. He oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area. Quill devised the standard testing procedures which, with variations for specific aircraft designs, operated from 1938. Alex Henshaw, chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940, was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory. He co-ordinated a team of 25 pilots and also assessed all Spitfire developments. Between 1940 and 1946, Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires, more than 10% of <b>total</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
40|$|The second law of thermodynamics, which asserts the non-negativity of {{the average}} <b>total</b> entropy <b>production</b> of a {{combined}} system and its environment, is {{a direct consequence of}} applying Jensen's inequality to a fluctuation relation. It is also possible, through this inequality, to determine an upper bound {{of the average}} <b>total</b> entropy <b>production</b> based on the entropies along the most extreme stochastic trajectories. In this work, we construct an upper bound inequality of the average of a convex function over a domain whose average is known. When applied to the various fluctuation relations, the upper bounds of the average <b>total</b> entropy <b>production</b> are established. Finally, by employing the result of Neri, Roldán, and Jülicher [Phys. Rev.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found {{positive}} associations between recruitment and indices of spawner quality (condition) for stocks exhibiting an indeterminate relationship between recruitment and spawner biomass. This suggests that spawner biomass is insensitive to interannual variability in condition affecting <b>total</b> egg <b>production.</b> This hypothesis was tested for the Northeast Arctic (NA) cod stock using a simulation approach. Because abundance of the Barents Sea capelin stock is an important determinant of condition of NA cod, the simulations varied length-specific proportion mature, weight, and fecundity of NA cod according to capelin biomass while holding numbers at length constant. <b>Total</b> egg <b>production</b> and spawner biomass and their associated errors were estimated for levels of capelin biomass which encompassed the range observed in the Barents Sea. Increasing condition significantly increased both <b>total</b> egg <b>production</b> and spawner biomass, however, the magnitude of increase in <b>total</b> egg <b>production</b> was approximately double that in spawner biomass. Incorporating hypothesized effects of condition on atresia and skipped spawning increased the difference between <b>total</b> egg <b>production</b> and spawner biomass. Comparing sim~~lation results for different numerical abundances and size compositions indicated that spawning stocks dominated by smaller length classes had larger differences between <b>total</b> egg <b>production</b> at the minimum and maximum capelin biomasses...|$|R

5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if <b>total</b> <b>production</b> is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E

5|$|Sometime in {{the spring}} of 1827, Poe turned over his manuscripts to an 18-year-old printer named Calvin F. S. Thomas, whose family may have been known by Poe's birth parents.

Poe used his own money to pay for the publication of his poems as the 40-page collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, the only known book printed by Thomas.

5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F.

Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's <b>total</b> <b>production</b> in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, <b>total</b> <b>production</b> had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the production of nutrients by different varieties of sorghum grown with high valuable indigofera legume in intercropping system and to determine the suitable variety of sorghum that produced the highest nutrient in the system. The experiment was done at Jonggol Animal Science Teaching and Research Unit (UP 3 J) Jonggol, from November 2014 to March 2015. This experiment was conducted using completely randomized design with 2 factors (3 x 4) and 4 replications. The first factor was sorghum varieties (PATIR 3. 2 (S 1), PATIR 3. 7 (S 2), and CTY- 33 (S 3)). The second factor was indigofera composition (0 % indigofera (I 0), 30 % indigofera (I 1), 40 % indigofera (I 2), and 50 % indigofera (I 3)). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and HSD test. There was no interaction among varieties of sorghum and indigofera composition. Indigofera population of up to 50 % in multiple cropping system had the highest (P< 0. 01) dry matter content, crude protein content, ash content, <b>total</b> fresh weight <b>production,</b> <b>total</b> dry weight <b>production,</b> <b>total</b> crude protein <b>production,</b> <b>total</b> ash <b>production,</b> and carrying capacity.

Parallel {{with the results}} for C 4 grass production, burns in the first spring of the study (2006) negatively affected <b>total</b> forage <b>production</b> (Scheintaub et al. 2009; Figure 5 c). During the subsequent eight-year period from 2007 to 2013, none of the burn treatments significantly affected <b>total</b> forage <b>production</b> across {{a wide range of}} precipitation conditions.

5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent.

Britain's Alvis-Staussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible. The Soviets were also interested so Škoda shipped the S-II-a prototype and one production LT vz. 35 to the proving grounds at Kubinka for evaluation. The Soviets were only interested in buying the prototype, but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well, believing that the Soviets would simply copy the design and build it without paying any royalties.|$|E
