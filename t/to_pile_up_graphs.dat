The errors disturb correct construction of <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> blocks. The purpose of this resrarch {{is to make the}} mobile manipulator syste which can bulid a fance being composed of the blocks as an example of constructing a huge structure. In this paper, a new recognition method to detect the position/orientation errors of the mobile manipulator on the irregular terrain using a hand-eye camera and 3 -D landmark is proposed. First, the Kinematical formulation of the mobile manipulator and the landmark is proposed. Second. the hqnd-eye system is constructed to recognized to the position and orientation errors. Third, repetitive calculation method to detect the 3 -D position/orientation errors is proposed. Finally. the proposed system is evaluated by simulation experiments...|$|R
