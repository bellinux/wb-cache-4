5|$|Shortly {{after moving}} in, Eddy became close to another student, Daniel Spofford. He was 33 {{years old and}} married when he joined her class; he later left {{his wife in the}} hope that he might marry Eddy, but his {{feelings}} were not reciprocated. Spofford and seven other students agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week if she would preach to them every Sunday. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> the Christian Scientists' Association.|$|E
5|$|Rise Against {{was formed}} in 1999 after the {{dissolution}} of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. Bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski were still interested in making music, and decided to start a new band. The two recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, the former lead vocalist of the punk band Baxter. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> Transistor Revolt, and released the extended play Transistor Revolt in 2000. Transistor Revolt garnered the attention of Fat Mike, the co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. He signed the band to a recording contract in 2000, with the stipulation that they change their name; the band members ultimately decided on Rise Against.|$|E
5|$|Ely was {{enrolled}} at Washington High School in Portland, Oregon. He {{did not play}} in the school band, but had a passion for singing. In 1959, Lynn Easton's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton on the drum kit. The two teenagers grew up together, as their parents were close friends. Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out a band. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> The Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group. The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermaket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist. Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University.|$|E

25|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of surrounding areas were Australian Aboriginals who arrived about 40,000 years ago.

Land grants by the new colonial government began in about 1810.|$|E
25|$|The Dropouts {{experienced}} {{a small number}} of personnel changes that eventually led to the group's current incarnation featuring Dan Watchorn on guitar, Vince Nudo on drums, and Mike Dyball on bass guitar. This lineup existed for no more than a year under the Dropouts name, before the suggestion of Priestess was made. With the band's change in musical style came new songs; no song on Hello Master dates back to before <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> Priestess.|$|E

25|$|The Wichita {{were known}} to tattoo their faces and bodies with solid and dotted lines and circles. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> Kitikiti'sh / Kirikirish ("raccoon-eyed people") because of the tattooed marks around their eyes. They wore clothes made of tanned hides, which the women {{prepared}} and sewed. They often decorated their dresses in elk teeth.

25|$|The {{origins of}} Þeyr {{date back to}} the late 1970s when singer Magnús Guðmundsson, bassist Hilmar Örn Agnarsson and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (drums and synthesizer) were playing in a garage band called Fellibylur (Hurricane). The band was {{expanded}} with vocalist Elín Reynisdóttir, who at the time was singing at a church choir, guitarist Jóhannes Helgason from a rock band called Piccolo, and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson from Hattimas. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> Frostrósir (Frostroses) and played rock music and some Icelandic songs at dancehalls in Reykjavík and its surroundings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, several {{movements}} advocating a separate status for Cabinda came into being. The Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (MLEC) {{was formed in}} 1960 {{under the leadership of}} Luis Ranque Franque. Resulting from the merger of various émigré associations in Brazzaville, the MLEC rapidly became the most prominent of the separatist movements. A further group was the Alliama (Alliance of the Mayombe), representing the Mayombe, a small minority of the population. In an important development, these movements united in August 1963 to form a united front. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> the FLEC, and the leadership role was taken by the MLEC’s Ranque Franque.|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} Cayuse people which lived {{to the west}} of the Nez Perce at the {{headwaters}} of the Walla Walla, Umatilla and Grande Ronde River and from the Blue Mountains westwards up to the Deschutes River, they oft shared village sites with the Nez Perce and Palus and were feared by neighboring tribes, as early as 1805, most Cayuse had given up their mother tongue and had switched to Weyíiletpuu, a variety of the Lower Nez Perce/Lower Niimiipuutímt dialect of the Nez Perce language. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> by their Nez-Percé name as Weyiiletpuu (″Ryegrass People″); today most Cayuse are enrolled into the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, some as Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs or Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 a {{group of}} Ray's {{students}} approached him about forming a band. Ray agreed and an informal group was formed. As the group practiced together and improved they were eventually asked to entertain in public. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> the Cupertino Banjo Band and the original nine members were Glenn Atkinson, Jerry Deerwester, Don Flora, Pearl Nicolino, Chuck Ray, Sr., Manuel Rodriques, Steve Sedlak, Sidney Steele, and Merle Wilhelm. Later, as the group increased in size, they temporarily called themselves the Golden Gate Banjo Band. Then in 1971, as an acknowledgment that band members came from a much larger area than Cupertino, {{they came up with}} the name Peninsula Banjo Band. The band included members from as far south as Santa Cruz and as far north as Burlingame.|$|E

25|$|On the {{political}} spectrum of Marxism, Trotskyists are usually considered to be toward the left. In the 1920s <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> the Left Opposition, although today's left communism is distinct and usually non-Bolshevik. The terminological disagreement can be confusing because different versions of a left-right political spectrum are used. Anti-revisionists consider themselves the ultimate leftists on a spectrum from communism on the left to imperialist capitalism on the right. But given that Stalinism is often labeled rightist within the communist spectrum and left communism leftist, Anti-revisionists' idea of left {{is very different from}} that of left communism. Trotsky and Stalin, despite being Bolshevik-Leninist comrades during the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, became enemies in the 1920s and thereafter opposed the legitimacy of each other's forms of Leninism. Trotsky was extremely critical of the Stalinist USSR for suppressing democracy and lack of adequate economic planning.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, Anderson formed a tag team with Larry Zbyszko and <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> The Enforcers. After {{competing}} for several months and moving up in the tag team ranks, they successfully captured the WCW World Tag Team Championship on September 2, 1991. The reign would be short lived, however, as they lost the titles roughly {{two and a half}} months later to Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes. Anderson and Zbyszko went their separate ways shortly afterward. Anderson quickly rebounded from his split with Zbyszko and formed a tag team with Beautiful Bobby Eaton, a long-time friend and best known for his time as one half of the Midnight Express. At this point, they were members of Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance. They quickly moved up the tag team division and were soon a threat to Steamboat and Rhodes. Anderson and Eaton quickly won the titles on January 16, 1992 and defended the titles against all comers for the next four and a half months before losing the titles to The Steiner Brothers in May.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} was concluded on 30 March 1946. A new {{government had to}} be formed before the Governor's rule lapsed on 29 April. The Congress, despite securing an overwhelming majority, was unable to agree upon a candidate for Chief Minister. Madras Presidency in 1946 was made of four linguistic regions - Tamil Nadu, Andhra, Mysore and Kerala and the Madras Congress Legislature Party (CLP) had four main factions. The factions were both regional - Tamil versus Andhra and Tamil versus Keralites and Karnataka members; and communal - Brahmin versus non-Brahmin. The largest faction {{was that of the}} sixty to seventy non-Brahman Tamil members headed by Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president Kamaraj. The remaining Tamil members were either uncommitted or supported Rajaji, who also had the support of P. Subbarayan. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> as the Reform Group and numbered between twenty and thirty. The Andhra faction made up of 77 members, was further divided between the supporters of Prakasam and Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya. There were also smaller Andhra factions of non-Brahmins from the Circars and non-Brahmins from the Rayalaseema. CLP also had eighteen members from Malabar and South Canara/Bellary.|$|E
