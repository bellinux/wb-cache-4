5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having {{a higher level of}} ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, {{in a similar manner}} to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E

Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the wine.|$|E
25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} {{necessarily}} determine <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the final wine, because the winemaker may choose to ferment the wine fully or let some residual sugar remain.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary reason}} that {{fructose}} is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative <b>sweetness.</b> It is <b>the</b> sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. <b>The</b> relative <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> fructose {{has been reported}} in the range of 1.2-1.8 times that of sucrose. However, it is the 6-membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar. Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form. Therefore, <b>the</b> relative <b>sweetness</b> decreases with increasing temperature. However it has been observed that <b>the</b> absolute <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> fructose is identical at 5 °C as 50 °C and thus <b>the</b> relative <b>sweetness</b> to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in <b>the</b> absolute <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> sucrose at lower temperatures.|$|R

25|$|The {{temperature}} of {{service is a}} criterion to put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served with ice. Between 8 and 9°C, the chill will accentuate the liveliness of the bubbles and reduce <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> a sweet or Fortified wine. For an aromatic dry wine service between 10 and 12°C stimulates vivacity and gives freshness to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at a temperature between 12 and 14°C which allows the flavours and the structure to be revealed.|$|E
25|$|The acidity in wine is an {{important}} component in the quality and taste of the wine. It adds a sharpness to the flavors and is detected most readily by a prickling sensation {{on the sides of the}} tongue and a mouth-watering aftertaste. Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the wine (the leftover residual sugar) and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine with too much acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste flabby and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on their skins to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending {{on the level of}} sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.|$|E
