5|$|After {{many years}} of {{evaluating}} {{a wide range of}} alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century, Highway 82 {{had grown}} to four lanes. It was easier for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the {{congestion}} that developed when it got there. Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> the city and/or county. In 1998 CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after considering all the proposals and taking public input, released a Record of Decision.

5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat {{with one of the}} smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts, {{along with}} the five other New England states, {{features}} the local governmental structure known as the New England town. In this structure, incorporated towns—as opposed to townships or counties—hold many of the responsibilities and powers of local government. Most of the county governments were abolished {{by the state of}} Massachusetts beginning in 1997 including Middlesex County, the largest county in the state by population. <b>The</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> these now defunct counties elect only Sheriffs and Registers of Deeds, who are part of the state government. Other counties have been reorganized, and a few still retain county councils.|$|E

5|$|Metcalfe's {{political}} career began in 1812 {{when he was}} elected to represent Nicholas County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. His service was interrupted by the War of 1812. In 1813, he raised a company of volunteers and commanded them at the Battle of Fort Meigs. While he was away at war, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> his district re-elected him to the Kentucky House; only thirteen votes were cast against him. He continued to serve in the Kentucky House until 1816.|$|E
5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson {{was anxious}} to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for {{the election of a}} new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E
5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E

There are nine council members elected on a nonpartisan basis at the regular municipal election or at the general election for terms of four years: one council member from each of five wards and four council members on an at-large basis. The mayor is also elected for a term of four years.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor of}} Paris is elected {{indirectly}} by Paris voters; <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> each arrondissement elect the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement {{has a number}} of members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes citywide is not selected if the other candidate has won the support of the majority of council members. Mayor Bertrand Delanoë (2001–2014) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> Henderson County chose Dixon to {{represent}} them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures {{to protect the rights of}} slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic. Though some of these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850.|$|E

5|$|Under the Maryland Constitution of 1776, the Governor {{was chosen}} for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly. An 1838 {{constitutional}} amendment allowed voters to elect the Governor to three-year terms from one of three rotating gubernatorial districts: eastern, southern, and western. At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland Constitution of 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from three to four years, which brought elections for Governor in line with elections for Federal offices that occur only in even years. Finally, the Constitution of 1864 eliminated the rotating gubernatorial election districts and, since the election of 1868, the Governor has been elected by all <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation of the New Orleans Hornets to Oklahoma City, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> that city approved a $120 million renovation of the Ford Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide tax breaks and other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Winter Olympics {{had been}} awarded in 1970 to Denver, United States, but in November 1972 <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> <b>of</b> {{the state of}} Colorado voted against public funding of the games by a 3 to 2 margin. The IOC turned to offer the Games to Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia, which had been a {{candidate}} for the 1976 Games. However, a change in provincial government brought in an administration which did not support the Olympic bid, so the offer was rejected. Salt Lake City, {{a candidate for the}} 1972 Games, offered itself, but the IOC opted to ask Innsbruck, which had maintained most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games. Despite only having half the time to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted the invitation to replace Denver in February 1973. Two Olympic flames were lit because it was the second time the Austrian town had hosted the Games. The 1976 Games featured the first combination bobsleigh and luge track, in neighbouring Igls. The Soviet Union won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal.|$|E
