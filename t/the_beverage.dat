5|$|Although hot {{chocolate}} is generally consumed for pleasure, <b>the</b> <b>beverage</b> confers several potential health benefits. A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, {{hot chocolate}} was valued as a medicine {{as well as a}} drink.|$|E
5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} to the parent company violated <b>the</b> <b>beverage</b> contracts between various parties. Negotiations between the two entities eventually failed, {{which led to a}} class action suit being filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Burger King Corporation, Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper on behalf of all Burger King franchises in the United States in May 2009. In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when <b>the</b> <b>beverage</b> is heated.|$|E

With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush and Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks caused by LeChuck exploding.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in <b>the</b> <b>beverage</b> contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E

40|$|Arabica and Robusta {{coffee beans}} were roasted at 220 ^ 108 C for 7, 9 and 11 min to {{identify}} chemical descriptors in <b>the</b> <b>beverages.</b> <b>The</b> pH of <b>the</b> <b>beverages</b> showed <b>the</b> lowest {{value in the}} medium roasting level. In each degree of browning, the soluble solids content remained slightly higher in Arabica drinks. The contents of caffeine did not vary, but trigonelline decreased with burning up intensity. Chlorogenic acids also decreased with increasing roasting time. The 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid prevailed in Arabica and Robusta <b>beverages,</b> but <b>the</b> isomers of dicaffeoylquinic and feruolilquı´nic acids remained higher in Robusta. It was concluded that trigonelline and total caffeoylquinic, fatty dicaffeoylquinic and fatty feruolilquı´nic acids detached <b>the</b> <b>beverages</b> according to roasting intensity. Caffeine and pH allowed drinks separation between both species. Soluble solids take apart Arabica and Robusta drinks in each degree of roasting.
