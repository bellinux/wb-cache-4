"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching.</b> Both of you." ...|$|E

In later series, this was accompanied by her following speech: [...] "I'd like to <b>thank</b> all of <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> me and my little show here tonight; if you've enjoyed it, then it's all been worthwhile. So, until we meet again, goodbye - and I love you all!" [...] after which she would be showered with gifts of champagne, boxes of chocolates, etc. Her presence was never explained on the programme. In one episode she [...] "marries" [...] Arthur Lowe who claims he only agreed to appear on the understanding he could meet her.

40|$|Isolation {{of cells}} from the primary source is a {{necessary}} step in many more complex protocols. Miltenyi offers kits to isolate cells from several organisms including humans, non-human primates, rat and, as we describe here, mice. Magnetic bead-based cell separation allows for either positive selection (or cell depletion) as well as negative selection. Here, we demonstrate negative selection of untouched or na ve CD 4 + helper T cells. Using this standard protocol we typically purify cells that are ≥ 96 % pure CD 4 +/CD 3 +. This protocol is {{used in conjunction with}} the protocol Dissection and 2 -Photon Imaging of Peripheral Lymph Nodes in Mice published in issue 7 of JoVE, for purification of T cells and other cell types to adoptively transfer for imaging purposes. Although we did not demonstrate FACS analysis in this protocol video, it is highly recommended to check the overall purity of isolated cells using the appropriate antibodies via FACS. In addition, we demonstrate the non-sterile method of T cell isolation. If sterile cells are needed for your particular end-user application, be sure to do all of the demonstrated procedures in the tissue culture hood under standard sterile conditions. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> and good luck with your own experiments...|$|E

I hope you know that it is because of you I am able to chase my dreams. To my daughter Adelaide, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> being the inspiration I need to always be my best self. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> giving me the motivation to succeed even when the odds are stacked against me. To my family, by blood and by law, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> believing in me and for always encouraging me to be my very best. I would not have gotten this far without you...|$|R
