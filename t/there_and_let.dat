25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E
500|$|A {{supporter}} of the Democratic Party, Ebert publicly urged liberal filmmaker Michael Moore to give a politically charged acceptance speech at the Academy Awards: [...] "I'd like to see Michael Moore get up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> 'em have it with both barrels and really let loose {{and give them a}} real rabble-rousing speech." [...] During a 1996 panel at the University of Colorado at Boulder's Conference on World Affairs, Ebert coined the Boulder Pledge, by which he vowed never to purchase anything offered through the result of an unsolicited email message, or to forward chain emails or mass emails to others. Ebert endorsed Barack Obama for re-election as President in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The Allied command {{structure}} was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the Kokoda Track campaign. MacArthur was {{highly critical of}} the Australian performance, and confided to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, that [...] "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking." [...] MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that [...] "in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea." [...] Jack Beasley suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: [...] "Moresby is going to fall. Send Blamey up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> him fall with it!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In a January 2010 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy said, [...] "First of all, I haven't recorded {{a new album}} as such. I've recorded a lot of songs, but I haven't planned beyond just putting the songs out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> them have their own life, {{and see how the}} music lives on its own, without videos, without a big promotion. It's more just about getting songs out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> them have their own life."On 8 March 2010, production duo Crookers released their new album Tons of Friends which features Murphy on the tracks [...] "Royal T" [...] and [...] "Hold Up Your Hand".|$|R
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{his first}} {{official}} {{year on the}} track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track. His jockey, Willie Lovell, explained {{that he needed to}} do very little to win: [...] "In the stretch, when I saw Easy Jet had it, I let him run his own race. All I had to do was just sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E

If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> us alone.” ...|$|E
5000|$|I think, ultimately, gun to my head, TV is the place. Being able {{to spend}} years with a character, to really develop them, to {{understand}} them, to challenge the actor, {{to learn from the}} actor, to work with a team of writers - that experience is so fulfilling. The idea of putting something out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> it grow is really exciting.|$|R

5000|$|Transcripts of {{telephone}} conversations reveal that by December 1970 Nixon's {{dissatisfaction with the}} success of the bombings prompted him to order that they be stepped up.

I want them to use the big planes, the small planes, everything they can that will help out <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>let's</b> start giving them a little shock." ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 1875, Sioux {{delegations}} {{headed by}} Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in an eleventh-hour attempt to persuade President Ulysses S. Grant to honor existing treaties and stem {{the flow of}} miners into their territories. [...] They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. [...] The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). [...] The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. [...] Spotted Tail said, [...] "You speak of another country, {{but it is not}} my country; it does not concern me, and I {{want nothing to do with}} it. [...] I was not born there... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> us alone."

2500|$|Inayat Khan and Vera met at Manetta's, a {{restaurant}} in Clarges Street, Mayfair. Above all else, Vera wished to confirm that Inayat Khan believed in her own ability to succeed. Confidence {{was the most important}} thing for any agent. However poor Inayat Khan 's jumping or even her encoding, Vera knew that those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Inayat Khan feel that she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Vera began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Inayat Khan looked startled and said: [...] "Yes, of course." [...] Vera then told her about the letter and its contents. Inayat Khan was upset that anybody should think she was not fit for the job. [...] "You know that if you have any doubts, it is not too late to turn back," [...] Vera said. [...] "If you don't feel you're the type–if for any reason whatever you don't want to go p you only have to tell me now. I'll arrange everything so that you have no embarrassment. You will be transferred to another branch of the service with no adverse mark on your file. We have every respect for the man or woman who admits frankly to not feeling up to it." [...] She ended by adding: [...] "For us there is only one crime: to go out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> your comrades down." ...|$|E
