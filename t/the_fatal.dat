5|$|On {{the episode}} of Raw {{following}} Over the Limit, Bret Hart was announced {{as the new}} Raw General Manager. During Batista's promo {{at the beginning of}} the show, Hart interrupted and told him that if he wanted a rematch against Cena, he would have to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>Fatal</b> 4-way match at <b>the</b> <b>Fatal</b> 4-Way pay-per-view in June. Batista refused to wrestle, citing his injuries, and as a result Hart awarded the match to his opponent Orton by forfeit. Following Hart's decision, Batista quit WWE. This storyline was put in place as Batista was legitimately leaving WWE to pursue acting and a career in mixed martial arts.|$|E

It was the fourth loss of a DC-6 and <b>the</b> third-most <b>fatal</b> at <b>the</b> time.|$|R
50|$|The {{lyrics of}} <b>the</b> <b>Fatals</b> Picards are often of a parodic or humoristic character, though some songs, more {{particularly}} in the recent years, are more of a militant left-wing kind.|$|R
5000|$|C'est l'histoire d'une meuf, {{parody of}} the video for a song by {{humanitarian}} band les Enfoirés. <b>The</b> <b>Fatals</b> Picards accuse some of the singers in that band of being in there only to restart a flagging career.|$|R

5|$|The {{location}} of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy {{moved through the}} pantry facing east. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that a second gunman actually fired <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> shot, a possibility supported by former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch. Other witnesses, though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. <b>The</b> <b>fatal</b> injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Commandante, {{parody of}} songs by e.g. Noir Désir, mixing {{somewhat}} confused but strongly expressed left-wing political messages and somewhat meaningless Spanish lyrics meant {{to give a}} South American feel (in <b>the</b> <b>Fatals</b> song, <b>the</b> Spanish backing vocals are actually road directions).|$|R
50|$|In 2015, <b>the</b> Cerro <b>Fatal</b> {{tortoises}} {{were described}} as a distinct taxon, donfaustoi. Prior to the identification of this species through genetic analysis, {{it was noted that}} there existed differences in shells between <b>the</b> Cerro <b>Fatal</b> tortoises and other tortoises on Santa Cruz. By classifying <b>the</b> Cerro <b>Fatal</b> tortoises into a new taxon, greater attention can be paid to protecting its habitat, according to Adalgisa Caccone, {{who is a member of}} the team making this classification.|$|R

50|$|In 1931 Frederick Griffith coauthored a {{paper on}} acute tonsillitis—its sequelae, epidemiology, and bacteriology. In 1934, Griffith {{reported}} voluminous findings on the serological typing of Streptococcus pyogenes. More casually as well as medically called simply streptococcus, S pyogenes is implicated in conditions ranging from the usually minor strep throat, to <b>the</b> sometimes <b>fatal</b> scarlet fever, to <b>the</b> often <b>fatal</b> puerperal fever, to <b>the</b> usually <b>fatal</b> streptococcal sepsis. Streptococcal infection was a frequent coinfection complicating recovery from lobar pneumonia by pneumococci infection.|$|R

5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. <b>The</b> <b>fatal</b> dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} {{had serious}} puncture wounds {{on the front}} of the skull, indicating that it had been preyed upon by a large carnivore.

50|$|Starting in 2000, IWRG has on {{occasion}} promoted {{a variation of}} the steel cage match under <b>the</b> moniker Prisión <b>Fatal</b> ("Deadly Prison"). <b>The</b> Prisión <b>Fatal</b> name predates other IWRG steel cage match shows held by IWRG throughout the year, such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo ("Gulf War"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos ("War of the Sexes"), or IWRG El Castillo del Terror ("The Tower of Terror") shows. <b>The</b> Prisión <b>Fatal</b> shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in Arena Naucalpan, owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. <b>The</b> 2000 Prisión <b>Fatal</b> show was <b>the</b> first time that IWRG promoted a show under that name, and it was not used again until <b>the</b> 2012 Prisión <b>Fatal</b> show.|$|R

5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> crash.|$|E
5|$|Collyer Monument is an {{historic}} monument to firefighters in Mineral Spring Park, {{at the corner}} of Mineral Spring Avenue and Main Street, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, United States. The monument was built in 1890 by the sculptor Charles Parker Dowler to honor Samuel Smith Collyer, a fallen Pawtucket Fire Chief. The life-size bronze sculpture stands atop a pedestal of Westerly granite which contains a bronze plaque showing <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> accident and the reverse bears the inscription. The Collyer Monument represents a significant example of monumental work of the period and an early example of local civic pride. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{have been}} made to the alleged 2004 {{poisoning}} of Viktor Yushchenko, the alleged 2003 poisoning of Yuri Shchekochikhin and <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> 1978 poisoning of the journalist Georgi Markov by the Bulgarian Committee for State Security. The incident with Litvinenko has also attracted comparisons to the poisoning by radioactive (unconfirmed) thallium of KGB defector Nikolay Khokhlov and journalist Shchekochikhin of Novaya Gazeta (the Novaya Gazeta interview with the former, coincidentally, prepared by Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was later found shot to death in her apartment building). Like Litvinenko, Shchekochikhin had investigated the Russian apartment bombings (he {{was a member of the}} Kovalev Commission that hired Litvinenko's friend Mikhail Trepashkin as a legal counsel).|$|E
