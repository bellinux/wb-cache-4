5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana.

At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E

5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those <b>today,</b> <b>was</b> 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known <b>today</b> <b>was</b> invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare <b>today,</b> <b>was</b> widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal <b>today,</b> <b>was</b> first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ <b>today),</b> <b>was</b> shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
5|$|In the Outer Hebrides {{all of the}} {{inhabited}} {{islands are}} now connected {{to at least one}} other island by a land transport route, but only four Inner Hebridean islands are connected by road, all to the mainland. The Clachan Bridge from Argyll to Seil was designed by Thomas Telford and dates from 1792. Skye has been connected to Kyle of Lochalsh by the Skye Bridge since 1995. Danna is also connected to the Tayvallich peninsula in Argyll by a stone causeway; and tiny Eilean Donan, dominated by its castle, has had a connection to the mainland perhaps from as early as the 13th century. The arched bridge in use <b>today</b> <b>was</b> constructed in the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Thoroughbred as it {{is known}} <b>today</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th century and 18th century and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and around 100,000foals are registered each year worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{area known}} as Croatia <b>today</b> <b>was</b> {{inhabited}} throughout the prehistoric period. Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina. Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country. The largest proportion of the sites is in the river valleys of northern Croatia, and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include Starčevo, Vučedol and Baden cultures. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture.|$|E
5|$|The final {{development}} in the modern design of the clarinet used {{in most of the}} world <b>today</b> <b>was</b> introduced by Hyacinthe Klosé in 1839. He devised a different arrangement of keys and finger holes, which allow simpler fingering. It was inspired by the Boehm system developed for flutes by Theobald Boehm. Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is different from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the Oehler system clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert system clarinets.|$|E

5|$|The lords of {{the manor}} of Swakeleys resided at Swakeleys House, though {{the house that}} stands <b>today</b> <b>was</b> not the first on the site.

In 1803, a further £60,000 (equivalent to £ <b>today)</b> <b>was</b> added, and George's debts of 1795 were finally cleared in 1806, although the debts he had incurred since 1795 remained.|$|E
