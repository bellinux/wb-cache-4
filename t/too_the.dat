Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E

5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a good reason to dismiss anyone. In this way, <b>too,</b> <b>the</b> Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, <b>too.</b> <b>The</b> {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E

5|$|According to latter {{episode of}} Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself {{and with their}} help {{slaughtered}} the demon army. In this version, Kali {{is described as a}} Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon Raktabija. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas in herself and says that they are her different forms. In the Vamana Purana <b>too,</b> <b>the</b> Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.|$|E

Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario then turned to reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except {{for the city of}} Negroponte itself, and ruling it from the fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were taken, and Licario's ships raided the Peloponnese.|$|E

The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.|$|E

5|$|Leguat {{mentioned}} that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This {{may be the}} reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets {{would have been the}} last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, <b>too.</b> <b>The</b> Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy Pingré visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, <b>too.</b> <b>The</b> set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them <b>too.</b> <b>The</b> team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E

5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha <b>too.</b> <b>The</b> lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
