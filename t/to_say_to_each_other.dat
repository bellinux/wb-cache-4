The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they had something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other)</b> - and these results were not {{taken into account in}} the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E

60|$|Through {{the tunnel}} {{that had led}} me in pursuit of them we passed, walking slowly, for we had much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just yet, my boy. We {{have much}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> nor is she in this hotel. To-morrow, when both are better prepared, you shall meet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Stobell, [...] "you and me {{have got}} {{a word or two}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> I haven’t had the {{pleasure}} of seeing your ugly face since—" ...|$|E
6000|$|He glanced coolly around him. [...] "Whatever we've got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other," [...] he said deliberately, [...] "had {{better not}} be overheard. At least what I have got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'M {{afraid it}} won't do--for Leyton saw you," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Now, then, shut that door, {{for you and}} I, Jack Somers, have a word <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't go yet," [...] said Mrs. Walshingham, {{rising and}} taking his hand. [...] "I'm sure you two must have heaps <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other," [...] {{and so she}} escaped towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do people}} in society always have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other?</b> And the Lathebys are {{coming here to}} dine to-morrow, and will come again, I don't doubt, on the 27th." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad you've found {{something}} to amuse you, for it {{has seemed to}} me that you and Dale haven't had much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> I've been listening all the time." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was well}} that Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home {{had a great}} deal <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other-almost an inexhaustible fund of {{discourse}} in old recollections; otherwise, I think, our party would have been but a still one that evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fan, dear," [...] {{said the}} other, after {{returning}} from the bedroom {{to make sure that}} Merton still slept, [...] "we must talk in as low a tone as possible, I mean without whispering. And we have so much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's so {{long since}} we parted, and {{we have so much}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other!" [...] Bernard exclaimed at last, and he {{accompanied}} this declaration with a laugh much more spontaneous than the one he had given a few moments before.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} gratified him, however, {{to observe that}} his {{companion}} appeared to see no ground for joking in {{the idea that they}} should have a good deal <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} last night {{that we might have}} {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> I dare say that you may have thought that it was about Margaret and yourself. Isn't that so?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she could}} not weep, {{and the sight of}} her cold, pale, impassive face soon stopped the {{fountain}} of Ursula's tears. In a few moments, the sisters had nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{seem to find}} a {{great deal}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other," [...] said Mrs. Elliot, looking {{significantly}} at {{the backs of the}} couple as they turned away. [...] "Did you notice at the picnic? He was the only person who could make her utter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{see with}} {{different}} eyes in such matters.

6000|$|I need {{scarcely}} {{say that}} there was a hearty meeting between us three, and that we had much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> But in the midst of it all my mother turned to the old gentleman and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{messengers}} {{went and}} there followed a silence. There {{are times when}} the heart is too full for words; at least, Heliodore and I found nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> We only clasped each other's hand and waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you wait}} near the entrance?" [...] Signor Polani said. [...] "I see that my young cousin, Matteo, has {{accompanied}} his father, and you will, no doubt, find enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{while we are}} with the council." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{we have so}} much {{we might}} be <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other," [...] he tried again. [...] "So much we... ought <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{had reached}} the end of the rose-alley, where a summer-house that was in itself a rose-bower partly {{disclosed}} itself. The other gentlemen had lagged behind. [...] "I will amuse MYSELF, and console your other guardian, dear," [...] said the vivacious Milly, with a rapid exchange of glances with Yerba, [...] "until this horrid business is over. Besides," [...] she added with cheerful vagueness, [...] "after so long a separation you must have a great deal <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|R

The New York Times reported that on Sesame Street, Lee's Mr. Hooper ranked ahead of all live cast members in recognition by young audiences, according to a survey. His bowtie and hornrimmed reading glasses became his trademark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it curious?" [...] she remarked. [...] "When {{two people}} have {{something}} particular <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> {{and nothing to}} hinder them, they never seem {{to know how to}} say it. You are the oldest, sir. Why don't you begin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he exclaimed, {{suddenly}} {{giving a}} severe slap to his unoffending thigh, [...] "I'll {{have nothing to}} do with him. If he's so touchy--as that comes to, the less that he and I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit, Allan," [...] she said, [...] "and let us talk, for I {{think we}} have much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Have you slept well? And eaten?--though I fear that the food is but rough. Also was the bath made ready for you?" ...|$|E
60|$|She came in slowly, {{looking from}} one to another with her troubled glance, and finally {{accepting}} the chair that Captain Tremayne made haste to offer her. She had so much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> person present {{that it was impossible to}} know where to begin. It remained for Sir Terence to give her the lead she needed, and this he did so soon as he had closed the door again. Planted before it like a sentry, he looked at her between anger and suspicion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Afloat. You {{remember}} that the world of which we speak had its seas. A war {{was going on in}} it. It was a funny work! and terribly in earnest. Its war was being carried on over the land, over the water, under the water, up in the air, and even under the ground. And many young men in it, mostly in wardrooms and mess-rooms, used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other--pardon the unparliamentary word--they used <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'It's a damned bad war, but it's better than no war at all.' Sounds flippant, doesn't it." ...|$|R
