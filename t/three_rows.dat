5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window. On its side were <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E

5|$|The tail is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates that {{are found in the}} western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles on the head and shoulders, and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.|$|E
5|$|Under the Capstone {{refurbishment}} program most Amfleet I short-distance coaches had <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> {{of seats}} removed, reducing their total capacity from 84 to 72 seats. During the 1980s {{most of the}} Amfleet I long-distance coaches were refurbished for use on the premium Metroliner service on the Northeast Corridor.

5|$|During 2011–14, {{the club}} sold all 36,000 of its {{allocated}} season tickets each season and experienced an average match attendance {{that is very}} close to its maximum seating capacity (see table in previous section). Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, an expansion of the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended {{with the addition of a}} third tier which, in conjunction with an additional <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000. Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed for the start of the 2015–16 season.|$|E

5|$|Griffon {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains, colored red, yellow, and black. Each train has <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,400 riders per hour. Unlike traditional roller coasters, Griffon's trains are floorless, allowing the riders' legs to dangle throughout the ride. Riders also experience up to 4 times the force of gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated to two or <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, {{and then the next}} tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E

5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of six riders.|$|E
5|$|The {{next seven}} games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. Fischer {{was unable to}} get the initiative. Spassky was {{choosing}} lines that Fischer was unable to break. With a three-point lead, Fischer was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate. The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected {{to what he said}} were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly– they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants– removed the television cameras), a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including <b>three</b> <b>rows</b> of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
