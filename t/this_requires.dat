5|$|Stable {{isotopes}} of neon {{are produced}} in stars. 20Ne is created in fusing helium and {{oxygen in the}} alpha process. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> temperatures above 100 megakelvin, which are only available in the cores of stars of more than 3 solar masses.|$|E
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of vapors. In {{the absence}} of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may be {{installed}} at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel desk accessory to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. Control panels, however, {{are contained in}} separate files.|$|E
5000|$|Turning {{circle of}} 55 feet. <b>This</b> <b>required</b> a short wheelbase, but the ditch and bank {{climbing}} requirements also limited the vehicle's overhang beyond its wheels. Together {{with the weight}} limit, <b>this</b> <b>required</b> an extremely compact vehicle.|$|R

50|$|There {{is no more}} {{important}} element in the unique experience that is a UD education than the core curriculum of the undergraduate education. Almost no exceptions to <b>this</b> <b>required</b> coursework is allowed within the University for undergraduate students. Over the years even the most minor efforts to change <b>this</b> <b>required</b> course of study has resulted in chaos and conflict.|$|R
5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> {{the use of}} a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E
5|$|Moonlight Madness is a {{video game}} for the ZX Spectrum home computer, {{published}} in 1986 by Bubble Bus Software. It is an arcade adventure game in which players control a boy scout. The object {{of the game is}} to unlock a safe within a mansion to obtain pills for the mansion's owner, a mad scientist, who has collapsed. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> the player to traverse the mansion's rooms while avoiding hazards such as dangerous house servants and fatal falls.|$|E
50|$|The new {{toll plaza}} was {{retrofitted}} for open road tolling to encourage FasTrak use. <b>This</b> <b>required</b> {{the removal of}} eight toll booths.|$|R
5000|$|Extra-vehicular {{activity}} to perform practice {{work on a}} tool panel. <b>This</b> <b>required</b> installing handrails on later flights to prevent excessive astronaut exertion.|$|R

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E
5|$|Retail and OEM {{copies of}} Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro, and Windows RT can be {{upgraded}} through Windows Store free of charge. However, volume license customers, TechNet or MSDN subscribers and users of Windows 8 Enterprise must acquire standalone installation media for Windows 8.1 and install through the traditional Windows setup process, either as an in-place upgrade or clean install. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> a Windows 8.1-specific product key.|$|E
5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
50|$|Note: The {{title of}} the {{commission}} was changed to Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in 1943. <b>This</b> <b>required</b> a new commission for the ambassador.|$|R

50|$|In July 2010, the {{duplication}} {{of the section}} between Schwartau-Waldhalle and Kücknitz was put into operation; <b>this</b> <b>required</b> four new bridges to be constructed.|$|R
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with altitude, {{and this has}} an effect on the absolute pressure of the diving environment. The most important effect is that the diver must decompress to a lower surface pressure, and <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> longer decompression for the same dive profile.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are {{performed}} serially {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} dictated by these actions. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
50|$|Within {{months of}} the Battle of Tippecanoe, the United States {{declared}} war against Great Britain. <b>This</b> <b>required</b> the increased manning of the Regular Army.|$|R

50|$|Note: On September 30, 1952, the U.S. {{legation}} in Damascus was {{upgraded to}} embassy status. <b>This</b> <b>required</b> a promotion and new commission for the envoy.|$|R
5|$|When {{the game}} is completed, a {{challenge}} mode—ten trials called the Challenge of the Gods—is unlocked; <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., “Kill all cyclopes before time runs out”). The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, as rewards. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards.|$|E
5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; <b>this</b> <b>requires</b> taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
