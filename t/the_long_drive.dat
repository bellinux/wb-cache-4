25|$|Before the Barnsley and Shepley Lane Head Turnpike was built, {{this small}} hamlet was {{situated}} on the packhorse route from Penistone to Huddersfield. Merchants would travel from Penistone, through Thurlstone, along Broadstones Road and Dearne Dike Lane to Five Lane Ends, down Piper Wells Road, Cross Lane and Carr Lane, before turning down <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> into Shepley Carr. The route would then follow the fields (before they were enclosed), past the Shepley War Memorial, and into the village. The travellers would then head out towards Stocksmoor and Farnley Tyas through Stones Wood (where Devil worship once took place). Some old locals tell stories of a ghostly coach and fours furiously speeding down <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> on wintry nights before vanishing at the hamlet. The present house at Shepley Carr is the third building on this site and dates from 1862. A house which stood on the site previously burnt down in 1740.|$|E
25|$|Certain costly inefficiencies were {{inherent}} {{in the process of}} transporting live animals by rail, particularly {{due to the fact that}} some sixty percent of the animal's mass is composed of inedible matter. Many animals weakened by <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> died in transit, further increasing the per-unit shipping cost. Swift's ultimate solution to these problems was to devise a method to ship dressed meats from his packing plant in Chicago to the East.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Brympton is larger today {{than at any}} time in its history. Until the 20th century, it barely {{qualified}} as a village, having been deserted in the 14th century. Thereafter the village consisted of a few cottages scattered along <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> to the secluded mansion, a few of which can be discerned in the view by Knyff (illustrated right). Today a new urban area known as Brympton is a suburb of Yeovil, and has encroached on the seclusion of the house.|$|E

25|$|A {{secondary}} {{benefit of}} the mid-engine arrangement was that it created a smooth and streamlined nose profile. Much {{was made of the}} fact that this resulted in a configuration “with as trim and clean a fuselage nose as the snout of a high velocity bullet”. Entry to the cockpit was through side doors (mounted {{on both sides of the}} cockpit) rather than a sliding canopy. Its unusual engine location and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> shaft caused some concern to pilots at first, but experience showed this was no more of a hazard in a crash landing than with an engine located forward of the cockpit. There were no problems with propeller shaft failure.|$|E
25|$|Haig's typed diary – {{probably}} {{based on}} notes prepared in April - describes Petain as “almost unbalanced and most anxious”, claiming that after attending a French Cabinet meeting in Paris, {{where he had}} been ordered to “cover Paris at all costs”, he threatened to retreat on Paris, leaving the British right flank uncovered. Tim Travers argues that Petain said at the meeting that he would only retreat on Paris if Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Major-General Clive reported from the meeting that Petain had come away satisfied that Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Haig Petain denied that he had ordered a retreat on Paris or had threatened Haig that he might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported. Petain appears not to have discovered until 25 March that Michael was an all-out effort, but nonetheless was, according to other eyewitness accounts, in a state of despair by Tuesday 26 March. Sheffield's view is that Haig and Lawrence, on <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> back to GHQ from their meeting with Petain may simply have misunderstood his intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig's diary for this period were honest if mistaken recollections.|$|E
500|$|Regardless {{how it is}} credited, the {{horsepower}} race {{centered around}} the V8 engine and the muscle-car era lasted until new smog regulations forced dramatic changes in OEM engine design in the early 1970s. This in turn opened up new opportunities for aftermarket manufacturers like Edelbrock. Each year brought larger engines and/or increases in horsepower, providing a catalyst for customers to upgrade to newer models. Automobile executives also deliberately updated the body designs yearly, {{in the name of}} [...] "planned obsolescence" [...] and added newly developed or improved features such as automatic transmissions, power steering, power brakes and cruise control, {{in an effort to make}} the previous models seem outdated and facilitate <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> from the suburbs.

500|$|The {{development}} {{team found}} that players experienced greater freedom when controlling three characters in missions. Lead mission designer Imran Sarwar felt they opened up more strategic manoeuvres. He cited a combat scenario with the lead protagonists where Michael De Santa sets up at a sniper outpost and provides covering fire for Trevor Philips, {{who makes a}} frontal assault on the enemy position while Franklin Clinton manipulates flank points. Benzies felt that character switching streamlines the interplay between free roam and linear mission gameplay, as it eliminates San Andreas cumbersome long distance drives to mission start points. Players may [...] "explore the whole map without {{having to worry about}} <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> back", according to Benzies. Houser noted the mechanic's use during missions negated long drives as well. The open world's dynamic mission content is a feature borrowed from Red Dead Redemption, where it was received positively. Dynamic missions present themselves while players explore the open world, and may be accepted or ignored. The team implemented dynamic content all throughout the open world. In Los Santos for example, players may encounter an armoured van and try to intercept it to steal its contents.|$|E

2500|$|After {{six years}} since his last studio album, in 1997 Taylor {{released}} Hourglass, an introspective album {{that gave him}} the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. [...] "Jump Up Behind Me" [...] paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> from New York City {{back to his home}} in Chapel Hill. [...] "Enough To Be on Your Way" [...] was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996. Rolling Stone Magazine found that [...] "one of the themes of this record is disbelief", while Taylor told the magazine that it was [...] "spirituals for agnostics". Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and Hourglass was a commercial success, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard 200 (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on [...] "Little More Time With You". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is one of}} the {{occasions}} where doubt {{has been}} cast on the authenticity of Haig's diary. Haig's handwritten diary of the next meeting (Dury, 24 March at 11pm) is brief.

2500|$|Nelson Story {{decided to}} try for Montana and its lucrative market of gold miners in Virginia City, Montana and {{became part of the}} first ever cattle drive on the Bozeman Trail. He pointed his herd north for <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive.</b> With a large measure of courage and a large measure of luck he brought his cattle over the Bozeman Trail into Montana. At Fort Phil Kearny, between present day Buffalo and Sheridan, Wyoming, the U.S. Army ordered Story and his drovers to stop because of Indian problems. Story ignored the order, evaded the Army and {{continued}} the drive into Montana, encountering and fighting Sioux and Crow Indians along the way. Only one drover was killed by Indians. The feat would not be duplicated for another 4 years. Story and the herd arrived in what is now Livingston, Montana in December 1866 and established winter quarters for his men and cattle. Story's cattle established a thriving industry, and {{for at least two years}} he shrewdly bought and sold cattle to hungry miners for up to ten times the Texas price. In 1870, when the placer mining in Montana was starting to decline, Story and his ranch in the Paradise Valley had become the leading cattleman in the northern plains. Some credit Story with naming the now famous Paradise Valley for its grand scenery and abundant wildlife. This 1866 cattle drive inspired Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Lonesome Dove., ...|$|E
