5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the <b>test</b> <b>procedures,</b> which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E

They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty <b>test</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing s null {{hypotheses}} simultaneously. In {{order to deal with}} the multiplicity problem, the classical approach is to restrict attention to multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> that control the familywise error rate (FWE). The closure method of Marcus et al. (1976) reduces {{the problem of}} constructing such procedures to one of constructing single tests that control the usual probability of a Type 1 error. It was shown by Sonnemann (1982, 2008) that any coherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> can be constructed using the closure method. Moreover, it was shown by Sonnemann and Finner (1988) that any incoherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> can be replaced by a coherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> which is at least as good. In this paper, we first show an analogous result for dissonant and consonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures.</b> We show further that, in many cases, the improvement of the consonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> over the dissonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> may in fact be strict {{in the sense that it}} has strictly greater probability of detecting a false null hypothesis while still maintaining control of the FWE.

5|$|The {{ski jumping}} venue {{took place at}} Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was {{gathered}} on the wind flow within the ski jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The test event for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that the ski jumping events took place as scheduled. The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners of the ski jumping test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs {{on the side of the}} hill, mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.|$|E

25|$|Statistics is {{increasingly}} {{being taught in}} schools with hypothesis testing {{being one of the}} elements taught. Many conclusions reported in the popular press (political opinion polls to medical studies) are based on statistics. An informed public should understand the limitations of statistical conclusions and many college fields of study require a course in statistics for the same reason. An introductory college statistics class places much emphasis on hypothesis testing – perhaps half of the course. Such fields as literature and divinity now include findings based on statistical analysis (see the Bible Analyzer). An introductory statistics class teaches hypothesis testing as a cookbook process. Hypothesis testing is also taught at the postgraduate level. Statisticians learn how to create good statistical <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> (like z, Student's t, F and chi-squared).

40|$|Residential {{two-stage}} gas furnaces {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the total number of models listed in the March 2005 GAMA directory of equipment certified for sale in the United States. Two-stage furnaces are expanding their presence in the market mostly because they meet consumer expectations for improved comfort. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> serves as the method for reporting furnace total fuel and electricity consumption under laboratory conditions. In 2006, American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) proposed an update to its <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> which corrects some of the discrepancies found in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and provides an improved methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The objectives of this paper are to explore the differences in the methods for calculating two-stage residential gas furnace energy consumption in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and in the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and to compare test results to research results from field tests. Overall, the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> shows a reduction in the total site energy consumption of about 3 percent for two-stage compared to single-stage furnaces at the same efficiency level. In contrast, the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> shows almost no difference in the total site energy consumption. The 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> appears to provide a better methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The results indicate that, although two-stage technology by itself does not save site energy, the combination of two-stage furnaces with BPM motors provides electricity savings, which are confirmed by field studies...|$|R

Furthermore, we updated the O’Brien Fleming Group Sequential <b>Testing</b> <b>procedure</b> to make it more flexible via three extensions.
