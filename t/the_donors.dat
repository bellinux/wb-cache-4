5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|During the hot Washington summers, the Harrisons {{took refuge}} in Deer Park, Maryland and Cape May Point, New Jersey. In 1890, John Wanamaker joined with other Philadelphia devotees of the Harrisons and made a gift to them of a summer cottage at Cape May. Harrison, though appreciative, was uncomfortable with the {{appearance}} of impropriety; a month later, he paid Wanamaker $10,000 as reimbursement to <b>the</b> <b>donors.</b> Nevertheless, Harrison's opponents made the gift the subject of national ridicule, and Mrs. Harrison and the president were vigorously criticized.|$|E

5|$|In {{organizing}} a 1952 exhibition of abstract art, Marcus lured local leaders {{to the show}} by two means. First, he solicited the donation of art from the collections of David Rockefeller and his brothers, along with those from other noted national business leaders. Second, he requested that <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> personally write letters of invitation to their Dallas colleagues, feeling that the otherwise suspect art would benefit from the imprimatur of respected figures known for their fine taste. His efforts were rewarded by a numerous and appreciative turnout for the show.|$|E
5|$|Johann Ludwig Schneller {{brought in}} skilled Arab laborers from Bethlehem and Beit Jala to {{construct}} a total of eight buildings, which were constructed in stages and completed in the early 20th century. The year of completion {{and the name of}} the German city in which <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> for that building lived were engraved on each building façade. One of the buildings, called “the Red House” or “the model house,” was built entirely from materials produced on the orphanage grounds, including bricks, floor tiles and wrought-iron work.|$|E
5|$|Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded {{they show}} an {{exterior}} view of saints and <b>the</b> <b>donors.</b> The inner panels contain {{scenes from the}} Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement.|$|E
50|$|Prior to each donation, <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> iron {{level is}} checked {{to make sure}} they are not anaemic. <b>The</b> <b>donor</b> will be {{required}} to fill in a questionnaire to provide consent and declare that the donation will be safe (for example, stating that <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> does not have a heart condition), and it is safe to give <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> blood to someone else.|$|R
50|$|Some {{donors are}} non-anonymous, {{but most are}} anonymous, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> {{conceived}} person doesn't know the true identity of <b>the</b> <b>donor.</b> Still, he/she may get <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> number from <b>the</b> fertility clinic. If that donor had donated before, then other donor conceived people with <b>the</b> same <b>donor</b> number are thus genetic half-siblings. In short, donor registries match people who type in <b>the</b> same <b>donor</b> number.|$|R
40|$|A gift on the {{occasion}} of death (donatio mortis causa) in Roman law was a contractual disposition, made during the life of <b>the</b> <b>donor,</b> and in his contemplation of his own death, which took effect upon <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> death. <b>The</b> donee had no claim against <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> during <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> life. Only on {{the occasion}} of <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> death, had <b>the</b> donee assumed property rights over {{the subject matter of the}} gift. The transfer of property was conditional upon the donee outliving <b>the</b> <b>donor.</b> In contrast, a post-mortem gift (donatio post mortem) a contract modality with a suspensive term (délai suspensif). It gave the donee the claim against <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> during <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> lifetime, but delayed until the occasion of <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> death. Here, <b>the</b> transfer of property rights was not conditional upon the donee outliving <b>the</b> <b>donor,</b> as <b>the</b> donnee's inheritors could succeed to his rights against <b>the</b> <b>donor.</b> A post-mortem gift and a gift {{on the occasion}} of death had significantly different legal effects in Roman law. Still, the confusion among the two is not uncommon in contemporary legal doctrine and legislation. For instance, some agreements are sometimes labeled as gifts {{on the occasion of}} death, even though they do not possess characteristics of the Roman donatio mortis causa. On the other hand, a post-mortem gift is occasionally being assigned certain characteristics, which are in fact typical for a gifts on the occasion of death...|$|R
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Trustees of the Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds, Inc., was {{established}} and incorporated in 1983, and replaced a similar entity that {{was established}} in 1924. The Trustees manage endowments, most of which provide annual scholarships to graduating seniors based on criteria stipulated by <b>the</b> <b>donors.</b> Combined endowment assets are currently valued at or around $1.68 million (adjusted for inflation) covering thirty-four annual scholarships. To recognize the custodianship provided by the Trustees, the BCCAA has placed a bronze plaque in the main hall of the school which carries an individually cast nameplate {{for each of the}} thirty-four permanent endowments held by the Trustees.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend <b>the</b> <b>donors,</b> and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxable income}} of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> {{is reduced by}} 300 USD. If <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> income was in the 35% income tax bracket {{both before and after}} <b>the</b> deduction, <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> tax {{liability}} (amount of taxes owed to the government) is reduced by 105 USD.|$|R

5|$|The square is a tree-lined {{section of}} Millennium Park {{with a large}} lawn. The area {{broadcasts}} free wifi wireless technology. The square has {{earned a reputation as}} an outdoor culture spot by hosting a wide range of cultural events such as local and international art and photography exhibitions, as well as occasional live musical performances. This reputation is reminiscent of the earlier neo-classical meeting place. When Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley dedicated the square, it was dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>donors,</b> known as the Founders Group, who funded Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{consists of}} the two donor wings, a pair of saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. <b>The</b> <b>donors</b> are on the outer wings, kneeling in front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in grisaille make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony {{the patron saint of}} skin diseases and ergotism, known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece, of which Rolin was a member.|$|E

5000|$|When a taxable gift in {{the form}} of cash, stocks, real estate, or other {{tangible}} or intangible property is made, the tax is usually imposed on <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> (<b>the</b> giver) unless there is a retention of an interest which delays completion of the gift. A transfer is [...] "completely gratuitous" [...] when <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> receives nothing of value in exchange for the given property. A transfer is [...] "gratuitous in part" [...] when <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> receives some value but the value of the property received by <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> is substantially less than the value of the property given by <b>the</b> <b>donor.</b> In this case, the amount of the gift is the difference.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{screening}} is complete and a legal contract signed, <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> will begin <b>the</b> donation cycle, which typically takes {{between three and}} six weeks. An egg retrieval procedure comprises both <b>the</b> Egg <b>Donor's</b> Cycle and <b>the</b> Recipient's Cycle. Birth control pills are administered {{during the first few}} weeks of the egg donation process to synchronize <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> cycle with <b>the</b> recipient's, followed by a series of injections which halt the normal functioning of <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> ovaries. These injections may be self-administered on a daily basis for a period of one to three weeks. Next, follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH) are given to <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> to stimulate egg production and increases the number of mature eggs produced by the ovaries. Throughout <b>the</b> cycle <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> is monitored often by a physician using blood tests and ultrasound exams to determine <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> reaction to <b>the</b> hormones and the progress of follicle growth.|$|R
5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with <b>the</b> <b>donors,</b> and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} panels contain both {{saints and}} donors; the kneeling donors face inwards towards the center panel. These exterior panels are unusual for devotional triptychs {{of the period}} in that <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> face each other, seemingly without an object for their devotion; the usual convention was to show them facing saints. Art historians speculate Memling meant to {{emphasize the importance of}} the devotional scenes on the interior panels by having <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> gaze directly at the opening between the panel doors.|$|E

5000|$|Doctors and {{the media}} debated whether <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> and/or <b>the</b> {{recipient}} had attempted suicide, with reports stating that <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> had hanged herself. The family of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> told <b>the</b> funeral director who handled <b>the</b> <b>donor's</b> death {{that it had been}} accidental. Local French newspapers stated that Dinoire's daughter said that her mother had attempted suicide. Dubernard said that the recipient had not tried to kill herself. Olivier Jardé, an orthopedic surgeon from Amiens {{and a member of the}} French National Assembly, said that both <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> and <b>the</b> recipient had attempted suicide. The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, stated that Dinoire had said in a telephone interview that she had tried to commit suicide. In her 2007 memoir, Dinoire stated that <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> had killed herself, and this [...] "gave Dinoire a feeling of sisterhood" [...] with her.|$|R
25|$|Blood donors in India donate around 350 millilitres of blood.

25|$|The {{figures in}} the four panels of the lower {{register}} are all positioned within uniform niches. The outer panels show <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The inner panels contain grisaille paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. The grisaille is used to give the illusion of sculpture and imply that these are cult representations of the two saints before which <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> kneel, gazing into the distance with their hands clasped together in veneration. As with {{the most of the}} other panels on the inner and outer views, they are lit from the right. Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth, and bring realism to both the faux statues and painted niches.|$|E
