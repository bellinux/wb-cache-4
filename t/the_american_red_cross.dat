50|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>red</b> {{squirrel}} (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is one {{of three}} species of tree squirrel currently classified in the genus Tamiasciurus, known as the pine squirrels (the others are the Douglas squirrel, T. douglasii, and Mearns's squirrel, T. mearnsi). <b>American</b> <b>red</b> squirrels are also referred to as pine squirrels, North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> squirrels, boomers, and chickarees. They are medium-sized (200-250 g) diurnal mammals that defend a year-round exclusive territory. The diet of these tree squirrels is specialized on the seeds of conifer cones. As such, they are widely distributed across North America wherever conifers are common, except on the Pacific coast, where they are replaced by Douglas squirrels. Recently, <b>American</b> <b>red</b> squirrels have been expanding their range to include primarily hardwood areas.|$|R

50|$|Red {{squirrels}} can {{be easily}} distinguished from other North American tree squirrels by their smaller size, territorial behavior and reddish fur with a white venter (underbelly).
