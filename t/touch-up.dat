5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} Game Boy incarnation of the Mega Man series came {{after the release of}} Mega Man 3 on the NES. Early reports of Dr. Wily's Revenge were made in February 1991 in both the magazine GamePro and Steven A. Schwartz's book The Official Guide to Mega Man. The North American version of this game and the first DOS Mega Man game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the Dr. Wily's Revenge North American artwork is a simple <b>touch-up</b> of Mega Man 3s regional cover, with the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped out of the picture.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-operative}} and post-operative care, facility fees, anesthesia, and medications must {{be taken}} into consideration when reviewing surgery costs. No surgeries are a guaranteed success and therefore a second procedure or a <b>touch-up</b> may be required to achieve the desired appearance. These costs are typically not included in the original cost.|$|E
25|$|Using today's {{digital imaging}} technology, {{this kind of}} picture editing is now usually done with a raster image editor, which is capable of even more subtle work {{in the hands of}} a skilled <b>touch-up</b> artist. In the fine {{retouching}} industry, the airbrushing technique is often considered a low-end practice, with significantly inferior quality to that found in the most important fashion photography publications.|$|E

5000|$|... 3.0: Released on March 14, 2009. This now {{includes}} {{the music and}} speech packs {{as part of the}} game download, as well as adding a plethora of <b>touch-ups,</b> enhancements, improvements, and many other new features to the game.|$|R
50|$|No live {{album was}} {{released}} from the tour, although one was planned as far as having a front and back cover designed and studio <b>touch-ups</b> being made on several recorded tracks. Eventually, the album was shelved due to contractual disputes with Allen Klein.|$|R
25|$|Microsoft {{developed}} Windows 3.1, {{which included}} several minor improvements to Windows 3.0, but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode, and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a <b>touch-up</b> to Windows 3.1 which included {{all of the}} patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} most {{extensive}} recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and <b>touch-up</b> of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, {{who was responsible for}} restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, <b>touch-up</b> of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to Mona Lisas left elbow with watercolour.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the impending release of OS/2 2.0, Microsoft developed Windows 3.1 (first released in April 1992), which included several improvements to Windows 3.0, such as display of TrueType scalable fonts (developed jointly with Apple), improved disk performance in 386 Enhanced Mode, multimedia support, and bugfixes. It also removed Real Mode, and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a <b>touch-up</b> to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the tour, the band went to Montreux, Switzerland, in October for some overdub work, returning to Musicland Studios in Munich in December to perform similar work. After some final <b>touch-ups,</b> Black and Blue was completed in New York City in February 1976.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a <b>touch-up</b> after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|Glue smears and {{droplets}} {{are sometimes}} present around the joints of furniture. They {{can be removed}} {{using a combination of}} scraping, scrubbing and sanding. These approaches remove surface glue, but not the glue beneath the wood surface. Sub-surface glue will reduce the absorption of stain by wood, and may alter the scratch pattern created by sanding. Both these effects will influence {{the way in which the}} wood colours when stains are used to finish the wood. To overcome this problem it may be necessary to locally stain and <b>touch-up</b> areas previously covered by glue to ensure that the finish on such areas matches that of the surrounding wood.|$|E
500|$|The Vancouver {{branch of}} Sony Pictures Imageworks was {{responsible}} for the digital <b>touch-up.</b> The group improved the sewer and high school battle scene with many of Spider-Man's poses and environments that were used in the film. The comic book was cited as a basic source for Spider-Man's poses. The visual designers helped bring the Lizard to life by first building a digital version of a production design maquette. Many of the staff were involved with the process. They also started by thinking about lizard biology and how his muscles would work. A large man referred to as [...] "Big John" [...] stood in as the character during shooting, performing much of the interaction with other characters. The computer-generated Lizard replaced him in post-production. The creators would then fuse the design of the Lizard with the actor Rhys Ifans. Ifans then used motion capture for the Lizard's speaking parts, which Webb found challenging to incorporate into the character's final version.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} since, the stadium's {{capacity}} has gradually decreased. Following different modernization <b>touch-ups,</b> more seats were added. During the mid-1990s, {{in order to}} meet UEFA demands for spectators' comfort and security, standing places at the stadium were completely done away with. Seats were installed on all 4 stands so that the stadium‘s maximum capacity was 60,000.|$|R
50|$|The wig on each human AA is {{made from}} natural human hair for the highest degree of realism, {{although}} using real hair creates its own problems, since the changing humidity and constant rapid motions of the moving AA carriage hardware throughout the day cause the hair to slowly lose its styling, requiring <b>touch-ups</b> before each day's showing.|$|R
2500|$|The current seven-volume, English-language [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] edition is {{published}} in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering {{was done by}} Walden Wong.

2500|$|The {{benefits}} of ultrasonic welding {{are that it}} is much faster than conventional adhesives or solvents. [...] The drying time is very quick, and the pieces {{do not need to}} remain in a jig {{for long periods of time}} waiting for the joint to dry or cure. [...] The welding can easily be automated, making clean and precise joints; the site of the weld is very clean and rarely requires any <b>touch-up</b> work. The low thermal impact on the materials involved enables a greater number of materials to be welded together.|$|E
2500|$|Several options {{have been}} {{considered}} {{to deal with the}} damage. Officials at Arlington National Cemetery determined that proper repair can return the Tomb Monument to an acceptable appearance. However, because the cracks will continue to lengthen and widen, continuous grouting, regrouting, <b>touch-up,</b> monitoring, and maintenance would be required. Therefore, a report commissioned by Arlington National Cemetery and published in June 2006 confirmed the Cemetery's conclusion that [...] "replacement of the three pieces of the Tomb Monument is the preferred alternative". A final decision was scheduled to be made on September 30, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|The {{updated version}} {{was first used}} by Fisk Tires, to {{showcase}} its newly introduced Air-Flights in advertisements. This included twelve times in the Saturday Evening Post, between Feb. 8 and Aug. 23, 1930 (pictured atop). It was offered {{to the public as}} an 11x14" [...] art print in 1930. The image appeared in many other formats, with or without a facial <b>touch-up.</b> For instance, on the front cover and endpapers of promotional children's books in 1931. Subjects: Candy Land, Jack and the Bean Stalk, Little Black Sambo, Peter Rabbit, The Three Bears and Three Little Kittens. They were subtitled [...] "Time to Re-tire / A Bedtime Story." [...] It also showed up on ashtrays, bridge score pads, electrical clocks, five different jigsaw puzzles (#1 pictured), matchbooks, posters and rubber heel replacements for shoes. These items were either freebies, or giveaways with an automotive purchase. Martin's version was used by Fisk retailers on their data books, display windows, letterheads and mailing envelopes (pictured). It appeared in a scaled-down form, in Boys' Life and other magazines (along with hundreds of newspapers) from 1930-34. Fisk Tires then went back to the original sleepy boy in 1935. Incidentally, Norman Rockwell drew many paintings featuring the character, which were published in 1917-19, 24-25. Likewise, J.F. Kernan and Leslie Thrasher, which were published between [...] 1924 & 27.|$|E
