5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E

Although the film did not perform well at the box office, Johar earned some appreciation for his performance. Critic Sarita A.

2500|$|Notwithstanding these arguments, [...] {{there is}} {{reportedly}} [...] "a consensus" [...] among Muslim economists that Islamic finance for commercial transactions [...] "would not be free", {{but would have}} some kind of [...] "cost" [...] other than interest. Taqi Usmani writes: [...] "People not conversant with the principles of Shari'ah and its economic philosophy sometimes believe that abolishing interest from the banks and financial institutions would make them charitable, rather than commercial, concerns which offer financial services without a return. Obviously, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> a wrong assumption.

2500|$|More {{evidence}} of reporting {{is found in}} Act 2 Scene 5. In this scene, in True Tragedy, after realising that the Battle of Towton is lost, Exeter, Margaret and Prince Edward urge Henry to flee, with Exeter exclaiming, [...] "Away my Lord for vengeance comes along with him" [...] (l.1270). However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> unqualified – {{there is no indication}} whatsoever of who [...] "he" [...] is. In 3 Henry VI, however, the line is [...] "Away; for vengeance comes along with them" [...] (l.124). In this case, [...] "them" [...] is Warwick, Richard and Edward, all of whom are mentioned by Prince Edward and Margaret in the lines immediately preceding Exeter's. As such, the line in True Tragedy can only be understood if one refers to the equivalent scene in 3 Henry VI. This type of anomaly, where vital pieces of qualifying information are omitted, is common in the bad quartos.|$|E
