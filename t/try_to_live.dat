5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E

25|$|When Pratt met Rogers at McClintocksville on a {{business}} trip, he already knew Charles Ellis, having earlier bought whale oil from him back east in Fairhaven. Although Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt, {{the two young men}} agreed to sell the entire output of their small Wamsutta refinery to Pratt's company at a fixed price. This worked well at first. Then, a few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt.|$|E

25|$|The monsters of {{the week}} in the series, Ghosts are twisted aberrations born from the regrets or {{suffering}} {{of people who have}} died and become lost in limbo. Panty and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts killing each other or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever Panty and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a paper-mache model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.|$|E
25|$|The girls try {{to adjust}} to the new world in which Alison is very much alive, while still {{trying to keep up with}} Ali's new lie about her {{whereabouts}} over the last two years. They <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> their lives free from 'A' after Aria manages to save them from Shana, the rooftop shooter, in New York. The girls think Shana was 'A', and with her gone, they no longer worry about 'A'. However, 'A' returns, blowing up the Cavanaugh house and leaving the liars more afraid than ever. With Alison back, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer notice how their friendship has changed since Ali's disappearance. The other residents in Rosewood also deal with Alison coming home, and it leads to Mona making an army against her, consisting of residents whom Ali bullied back in the day. The liars try to figure out who killed Mrs. DiLaurentis, and if there is a connection between her and the girl who was buried in Alison's grave, Bethany Young.|$|E
25|$|The series {{focuses on}} several social themes such as faith, organ {{donation}} {{and the treatment}} of middle-aged men. However, the main philosophy seen across the story is the individualism, the stance which emphasizes the moral worth of an individual. Subaru and Hokuto believe that nobody can fully understand another person's suffering. Despite his belief in this philosophy, Subaru is a resigned individual who worries more about others than himself. This is because Subaru believes he can hurt others {{with the idea that}} he will never understand other people. The same problem comes from the fact Subaru and Hokuto are twins and as a result <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in order to see each other as different people. Across the plot, Subaru develops as an individual as his actions are deemed as arrogant by Seishiro for taking the guilt. Additionally, he starts taking actions that he believes are immoral despite his reasons for them such as lying to a mother about her daughter's wish to stop her from taking revenge.|$|E

25|$|The {{sentiments of}} Jews {{who fled the}} 1929 Hebron {{massacre}} and their descendants are mixed. Some advocate the continued settlement of Hebron {{as a way to}} continue the Jewish heritage in the city, while others suggest that settlers should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in peace with the Arabs there, with some even recommending the complete pullout of all settlers in Hebron. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron. The two most public examples of the descendants' views are the 1997 statement made by an association of some descendants dissociating themselves from the then-current Jewish settlers in Hebron and calling them an obstacle to peace, and the May 15, 2006 letter sent to the Israeli government by other descendants urging the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement in Hebron in their names, and urged it to allow the return of eight Jewish families evacuated the previous January from the homes they set up in empty shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, was established in 2007. One of the purchasers is a descendant of Jews who fled Hebron during Arab massacres.|$|E
500|$|The first {{scientists}} {{to discuss the}} concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists. Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the [...] "obligation of the name" [...] {{in the context of}} compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation; Karl Abraham wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might then <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to their names in some way. In 1952 Carl Jung referred to Stekel's work in his theory of synchronicity (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related): ...|$|E
500|$|Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were {{captured}} {{before they reached}} Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck {{and the rest of}} the platoon in prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all. Almost all of Baum's unit was captured; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended. He was too weak to file a combat report, and hospitalized for several months after the war ended. He did not think his men had accomplished that much.

500|$|... "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was {{delivered}} on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that I did my best to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{penchant for}} {{addressing}} {{political and social}} issues, {{as well as their}} staid depiction in Corbijn's black-and-white sleeve photographs, contributed to the group's earnest and serious image as [...] "stone-faced pilgrim". This image became a target for derision after the band's critically maligned Rattle and Hum project in 1988. Various critics called them [...] "po-faced", [...] "pompous bores", and [...] "humourless". The group's continued exploration of American music for the project was labelled [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "misguided and bombastic". After Bono told fans on the 1989 Lovetown Tour that U2 would [...] "dream it all up again", the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s. They incorporated alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and adopted a more ironic, flippant image by which they embraced the [...] "rock star" [...] identity they struggled with in the 1980s. Bono referred to their 1991 album Achtung Baby as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree". Author Bill Flanagan summarised the impact of The Joshua Tree on the group's career in his liner notes for the album's 20th anniversary release: [...] "The Joshua Tree made U2 into international rock stars and established both a standard they would always have to live up to and an image they would forever <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979, Frith {{relocated}} to New York City, where he immediately hooked up with the local avant-garde/downtown music scene.

He spent some 14 years in New York, during which time he joined a few bands, including John Zorn's Naked City (in which Frith played bass) and French Frith Kaiser Thompson (consisting of John French, Frith, Henry Kaiser and Richard Thompson). Frith also started three bands himself, namely Massacre, Skeleton Crew, and Keep the Dog.|$|E
