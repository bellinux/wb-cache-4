5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of <b>those</b> <b>comments.</b> The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 2013, the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico {{observed}} {{a moment of}} silence to remember Regina Martínez, after a proposal made by Manuel Rafael Huerta from the Labor Party (PT). Huerta mentioned in his petition that a year after the murder the circumstances were still unclear and the official version from the government of Veracruz was not to be believed. The president of the chamber left <b>those</b> <b>comments</b> out, but found the proposal relevant and invited deputies to join in the minute of silence.|$|E

This angered Willkie, and on his return from his 49-day trip, he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his report at the White House.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made <b>those</b> <b>comments</b> about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E

25|$|Vivek Tiwary's The Fifth Beatle (2013), {{a graphic}} novel {{biography}} of the Beatles manager Brian Epstein, depicts a meeting between Parker and Epstein {{that took place in}} the mid 1960s. In the scene, Parker is satirically portrayed as a gluttonous, satanic figure. The scene contrasts Parker's management of Elvis with the freedom Epstein allows the Beatles. The scene also portrays Parker as anti-semitic. Tiwary claimed in an interview that Parker did make <b>those</b> <b>comments.</b>|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} argument, the Court again {{sided with the}} respondents. It noted that, indeed, five of the Justices had {{advocated}} a reconsideration of Aguilar when deciding another case. However, the Court said, this did not necessarily mean {{there had been a}} change in their jurisprudence or reasoning, because Aguilar's propriety was not in question when <b>those</b> <b>comments</b> were made. The Court stated that the views of its members, outside of a judgment to this effect, did not constitute a change in Establishment Clause law.|$|E

In January 2016, announcing an October date for the referendum, Matteo Renzi stated that if his reforms were rejected he would resign as Prime Minister and leave politics. Some opposition parties, predominantly Five Star Movement, Lega Nord and Italian Left, and also some newspapers like Il Fatto Quotidiano and Il manifesto, accused Renzi of turning the referendum into a plebiscite on his premiership with <b>those</b> <b>comments.</b> However, after some months, Renzi said that his government will continue {{until the end of the}} legislature.|$|E

Nonetheless, some players still sustained injuries. In the 2012 playoffs, the Chicago Bulls were eliminated after losing Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah to injuries, and the New York Knicks lost to the Miami Heat while losing Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert to knee injuries.

500|$|In September 2011, Chris meets Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a {{homophobic}} customer at the garage. Warren {{makes his}} prejudice against gay people clear to Chris. Mason said Chris was unsure {{how to respond}} to the situation, as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in the way Warren does. Chris tells his boss, Lucas Fitzgerald, about Warren, but he is disappointed when Lucas does not do anything about it. Of Chris's situation, Mason explained [...] "It was very confronting for him. And because the guy wasn't pointing his remarks directly at Chris, Lucas didn't understand why Chris was so offended. At first, he didn't have an appreciation of how deep <b>those</b> <b>comments</b> hurt Chris." [...] The storyline divided the opinions of viewers with some understanding why Lucas would not want to confront Warren, while others were on Chris's side. Mason said he was pleased that viewers were discussing the storyline and he admitted he appreciated both sides. The actor said [...] "Lucas wasn't there when the customer was saying these things, so he didn't understand Chris's point of view. However, as the story went along, we saw Lucas change and his respect for Chris grew." [...] Mason added the storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being willing to change your ideas.|$|E
