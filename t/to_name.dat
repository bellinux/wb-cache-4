5|$|A {{decision}} on which factions were <b>to</b> <b>name</b> {{chiefs of staff}} and military regional commanders was announced on 19 August 2003 as the first move in military reform, superimposed {{on top of the}} various groups of fighters, government and former rebels. Kabila was able <b>to</b> <b>name</b> the armed forces chief of staff, Lieutenant General Liwanga Mata, who previously served as navy chief of staff under Laurent Kabila. Kabila was able <b>to</b> <b>name</b> the air force commander (John Numbi), the RCD-Goma received the Land Force commander's position (Sylvain Buki) and the MLC the navy (Dieudonne Amuli Bahigwa). Three military regional commanders were nominated by the former Kinshasa government, two commanders each by the RCD-Goma and the MLC, and one region commander each by the RCD-K/ML and RCD-N. However these appointments were announced for Kabila's Forces armées congolaises (FAC), not the later FARDC. Another report however says that the military region commanders were only nominated in January 2004, and that the troop deployment on the ground did not change substantially until the year afterward.|$|E

5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run.

5|$|Claiming {{the right}} <b>to</b> <b>name</b> his discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune {{for this new}} planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.

This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E
