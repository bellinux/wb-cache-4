50|$|In January 2001, Verisign mistakenly issued two Class 3 {{code signing}} {{certificates}} {{to an individual}} claiming to be an employee of Microsoft. The mistake was not discovered and the certificates were not revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit. Because Verisign code-signing certificates do not specify a Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point, {{there was no way}} for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked, placing Microsoft's customers at risk. Microsoft had <b>to</b> later <b>release</b> <b>a</b> special <b>security</b> patch in order to revoke the certificates and mark them as being fraudulent.|$|R

50|$|In January 2010, Google {{security}} researcher Tavis Ormandy revealed <b>a</b> serious <b>security</b> flaw in Windows NT's VDM implementation {{that allowed}} unprivileged users to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level, noted as {{applicable to the}} security of all x86 versions of the Windows NT kernel since 1993. This included all 32-bit versions of Windows NT, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7. Ormandy did publish a proof-of-concept exploit for the vulnerability. Prior <b>to</b> Microsoft's <b>release</b> of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> patch, the workaround for this issue was to turn off 16-bit application support, which prevented older programs (those written for DOS and Windows 3.1) from running. 64-bit versions of Windows were not affected since they do not include the NTVDM subsystem. Once the Microsoft security patches had been applied to the affected operating systems the VDM could be safely reenabled.|$|R
