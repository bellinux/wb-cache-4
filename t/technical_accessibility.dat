500|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>accessibility</b> and a Do it {{yourself}} (DIY) spirit are prized in punk rock. UK pub rock from 1972-1975 {{contributed to the}} emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play. Pub rock also introduced the idea of independent record labels, such as Stiff Records, which put out basic, low-cost records. Pub rock bands organized their own small venue tours and put out small pressings of their records. In the early days of punk rock, this DIY ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands. Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was [...] "rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music". In December 1976, the English fanzine Sideburns published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned [...] "This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band". The title of a 1980 single by the New York punk band Stimulators, [...] "Loud Fast Rules!", inscribed a catchphrase for punk's basic musical approach.|$|E
50|$|The network {{approach}} to modeling using these programs is {{popular due to}} its <b>technical</b> <b>accessibility</b> to individual with general knowledge of computer simulation techniques and human performance analysis. The flowcharts that result from task analysis lead naturally to formal network models. The models can be developed to serve specific purposes - from simulation of an individual using a human-computer interface to analyzing potential traffic flow in a hospital emergency center. Their weakness is the great difficulty required to derive performance times and success probabilities from previous data or from theory or first principles. These data provide the model's principle content.|$|E

Because technology can meet the legal provisions and be legally compliant (e.g., no such product exists at time of purchase) but may not meet the United States Access Board's <b>technical</b> <b>accessibility</b> standards, users are often confused between these two issues. Additionally, evaluation of compliance can be done only when reviewing the procurement process and documentation used when making a purchase or contracting for development, the changes in technologies and standards themselves, it requires a more detailed understanding of the law and technology than at first seems necessary.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWeb {{pages are}} {{composed}} by several elements that allow users {{to interact with}} available content. Some of these elements, such as menus, are responsible for assisting the navigation in the website, helping in the localization and access of the information requested by the user.

Non-accessible menus hinder users find {{the information that they}} are looking for and therefore they can give up accessing the web site. This paper aims at addressing the problem by helping developers to create accessible web menus based on model-driven approach. Adopting this approach can help developers build accessible menus without knowing the <b>technical</b> details about <b>accessibility.</b> In direction to this objective, we initially studied the different types of menus and their structures, as well as the accessibility guidelines that involve creating accessible menus.

For many users for a BCI based interface is their first choice for good quality interaction, such as those with major psychomotor or cognitive impairments. However, there are many more for whom the BCI would be an attractive option given an acceptable learning overhead, including less severe disabilities and safety critical conditions where cognitive overload or limited responses are likely. Recent progress has been modest as there are many <b>technical</b> and <b>accessibility</b> problems to overcome.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to move from {{traditional}} delivery models and to introduce a flexible, pedagogically sound model that ’blended‘ a range of approaches together in a way that utilised the benefits offered by Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

Phase 1 of the study, completed in 2003, was the design and development of a process-based quality management system for web-supported learning (WSL) using a basic ISO 9000 approach (University of Pretoria, 2003). The second phase, reported in this paper, investigated what factors directly affect the quality of the web-supported learning opportunities (products) produced. A taxonomy of critical success factors for quality web-supported learning was derived from a comparative analysis of the literature. It was refined and validated by critical colleagues within the case study. It has three components: underlying assumptions and exogenous factors; refined taxonomy of factors in six categories; graphic interpretation based on Ingwersen’s (1996) model of information retrieval. The taxonomy emphasizes the dynamic nature of the teaching and learning process and non-negotiable factors such as staff and student training, <b>technical</b> support, <b>accessibility</b> and reliability of the technology...|$|R
