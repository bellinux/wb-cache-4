5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of eruption.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{periodic}} law, dubnium should belong to group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies investigated {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with the predictions from {{the periodic}} law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under tantalum in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of the Allied advance.|$|E

5|$|Possibly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> {{at which}} she was constructed, Tsukuba {{reportedly}} suffered from numerous defects. Shortly after she was completed in 1907, the ship sailed for America where she participated in the Jamestown Exposition Naval Review in May. The ship then sailed to Europe where she made numerous port visits {{over the next several}} months. While in Britain, Tsukuba was fitted with a Vickers fire-control system that calculated the firing data for each gun and with which the gunnery officer fired the guns in unison. Ikoma visited England in July 1910 as part of the Japan–British Exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The Amateur Radio on the International Space Station {{project had}} {{the crew of}} the station to make brief windows to radio contact with schools and clubs on the ground. The first school to be {{contacted}} by the ISS was Luther Burbank School in southwest Chicago. The contact had been planned for 19 December 2000, but due to technical problems, it was delayed to 21 December 2000. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of the space station, the window of radio contact only lasted for 5–10 minutes, which was usually enough for 10 to 20 questions.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of the aircraft, and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also {{take into account the}} exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|E

5|$|The {{process by}} which {{electric}} current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies {{with that of the}} charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet, tigris, {{as well as}} {{the common}} name, tiger, come from the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both used for the animal. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself a derivative of the Latin word tigris and the Greek word tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> with which a tiger launches itself at its prey. It is worth mentioning that Mesopotamia, where the Caspian tiger had occurred, has a river called 'Tigris'.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} light has become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower at the {{speed of light}} through glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} model for an {{active galactic nucleus}} is based upon an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core region of the galaxy. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc. In about 10% of these galaxies, a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.|$|E

However, they quickly adjusted. Film Roman went on to do the animation {{for the rest of}} the series and eventually The Simpsons Movie. Previously, the animation was produced by Klasky Csupo.|$|E

5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental {{means by which}} forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
5|$|The size {{of these}} castles varied {{depending}} on the geography of the site, {{the decisions of the}} builder and the available resources. Analysis of the size of mottes has shown some distinctive regional variation; East Anglia, for example, saw much larger mottes being built than the Midlands or London. While motte-and-bailey and ringwork castles took great effort to build, they required relatively few skilled craftsmen allowing them to be raised using forced labour from the local estates; this, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> with which they could be built – a single season, made them particularly attractive immediately after the conquest. The larger earthworks, particularly mottes, required an exponentially greater quantity of manpower than their smaller equivalents and consequently tended to be either royal, or belong to the most powerful barons who could muster the required construction effort. Despite motte-and-bailey and ringworks being common designs amongst Norman castles, each fortification was slightly different – some castles were designed with two baileys attached to a single motte, and some ringworks were built with additional towers added on; yet other castles were built as ringworks and later converted to motte-and-bailey structures.|$|E

An early experiment <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light was conducted by Ole Rømer, a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a telescope, Rømer observed the motions of Jupiter and one of its moons, Io. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes <b>to</b> traverse <b>the</b> diameter of Earth's orbit. However, its size was not known at that time. If Rømer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000m/s.|$|R
