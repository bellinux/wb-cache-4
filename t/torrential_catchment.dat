40|$|A {{project is}} a task {{comprising}} a set of interrelated activities requiring time and resources for their execution. It {{is often the case}} that during the construction of longitudinal and cross section structures for the regulation of a <b>torrential</b> <b>catchment</b> the required resources (labour, materials, mechanization, and finances) are often limited and because of that we face the problem of their efficient use. This paper deals with the problem of planning the execution of river regulation works on the Jelašnička River with the aim to minimize the time extension due to limited resources. In the planning phase of project realization labour force is the limited resource. Heuristic techniques, i. e. the Gray-Kidd algorithm with the use of MS Project software were applied in the distribution of resources for the purposes of optimal labour engagement. This method uses the data acquired by the CPM method of network planning as input elements. Through more iterations, by moving noncritical and then critical project activities, the minimal extension of project duration was achieved by engaging more labour force. Therefore, the proposed heuristic and CPM method performed well in resolving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem.

40|$|Abstract. A {{sediment}} routing {{model for}} steep torrent channel networks called SETRAC {{has been developed}} and extensively tested. SETRAC has been ap-plied to well document case studies on flood events in <b>torrential</b> <b>catchments</b> with substantial sediment transport in the Austrian and Swiss Alps. The influ-ence of form roughness, armouring and transport by size fractions on modelling bedload transport is discussed. The simulation results show the importance of form roughness losses when computing bedload transport in torrents and moun-tain streams. Neglecting from roughness losses results in an overestimation of the observed bedload transport {{by a factor of}} about 10 on average...|$|R
40|$|Flood hazard mapping can be {{performed}} using different methods that, generally speaking, can be grouped into four main categories: historical and paleohydrological methods, hydrogeomorphological methods, hydrological-hydraulic methods, and the recently developed dendrogeomorphological methods. These groups of methods {{are not mutually exclusive}} and, in fact, they should be used complementarily. Unfortunately, in the case of ramblas, this combination is really difficult. On one hand, paleohydrological methods are not suitable for so small and <b>torrential</b> <b>catchments</b> as ramblas are and, on the other hand, hydrological-hydraulic methods demand a large amount of hydrologic data, non available in most of these systems. Indeed, many authors assert the inadequacy of these methods to predict extreme floods in Mediterranean small catchments. Anyway, hydrogeomorphological method is nowadays achieving more relevance. It is based on the location and typology of landforms and sediments generated during floods in order to delineate flooding areas and identify processes. It is a qualitative approach that gives a realistic image of the processes and it is enough to make decisions, with a minimum effort, in the 80...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the efficacy of bioengineering works for sediment trapping and retention in <b>torrential</b> <b>catchments</b> in the Southern Alps of France. For this, we monitored the behaviour of brush layers and brush mats on fascines, established in the floor of 8 experimental marly gullies. The two main questions of this study were: 1 / Do the cuttings regenerate? 2 / How much sediment was trapped by each bioengineering structure? The study period was characterised by very dry conditions, as well as the occurrence of a centennial rainfall event (69 mmh- 1 during 1 h). The results show that, despite of the very unfavourable climate, the Salix species had a very good rate of regeneration, allowing the formation of thick vegetation barriers and covers. The bioengineering works permitted an efficient trapping of movable sediments in gully floors, with an average of 0. 05 m 3 per work in one year. Recommendations for the use of bioengineering works for restoring eroded catchments are proposed on the basis of the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Alluvial {{events in}} Italy are a {{constant}} and continuous problem {{due to the}} peculiar orographic and climatic setting of the territory. Even though less frequent than in the Alps, debris-flows and floods greatly contributed also along the Southern Apennines to build alluvial fans, a widespread geomorphic unit located at the catchment mouth. These areas have been frequently chosen as sites for the urban development, as they were considered safer than the valleys, for the lower probability of being affected by floods. Due to the orographic position, the heavy rainfall events characterizing the study area can lead to flash floods with large debris loads. Such phenomena may be extremely risky for the population, and cause heavy damages. Starting from the consideration that past events can provide information on future events, we compiled a database on alluvial events in <b>torrential</b> <b>catchments</b> of Campania region, a highly prone area to such phenomena. By consulting different types of information sources we collected about 500 events. The database is being constantly updated, and contains temporal and spatial information for each event, since availability of these data is considered a mandatory step in order to perform a correct hazard and risk analysis...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion on marly terrains is a {{frequent}} problem in the mountain and Mediterranean areas in the Durance catchment in the French Southern Alps. One {{of the consequences of}} this erosion is high yields of fine sediment at the exit of catchments, which can cause economic, social and ecological damages downstream. To avoid these sediment transports, an innovative use of bioengineering techniques can be considered by letting erosion occur on slopes while retaining the eroded materials before they reach the catchment exit, therefore obtaining low sediment yields with fewer interventions as possible. This can be carried out with the use of bioengineering structures within small gullies, where vegetation obstacles can play a very significant role in sustainable trapping and retention of fine sediment in gully floors. The application of such ‘low-cost' ecological action requires establishing a specific strategy for the interventions. To do this, research from 1998 aimed at better understanding the role of bioengineering structures and vegetation in controlling erosion and sedimentation in marly <b>torrential</b> <b>catchments</b> under mountainous and Mediterranean climate. Results were then used to propose rules, simulations and an action plan for such a control at the scale of the Durance catchment in France. En milieu montagnard, l'érosion et la sédimentation sont des phénomènes qui augmentent les risques d'inondation dans les vallées. Pour lutter contre ces processus, des méthodes inspirées de l'ingénierie écologique font leur preuve aujourd'hui en France, notamment dans le bassin versant de la Durance, où l'utilisation innovante d'ouvrages de génie végétal dans les lits des ravines érodées permet le développement d'obstacles végétaux efficaces pour piéger et retenir les sédiments...|$|R
40|$|Rockglaciers are {{the most}} {{prominent}} features of alp ine permafrost. They are creeping accumulations of debris, moving usually at rates of cm/yr or dm/yr. The observed changes on rock glacier dynamics are all related to velocity changes, and show in most cases an increase in velocity. Depending {{on the importance of}} the velocity increas e, the five following types of reaction can be distinguished: * Moderate positive and negative velocity changes, re lated to changes of MAGST with a time lag of one to two years. * Acceleration of rock glacier displacement, with opening of crevasses on the rock glacier surface. * Rupture and dislocation of the lower part of rock g laciers: in several cases, {{the lower part of the}} rock glacier starts to move significantly more than the upper part. * Total collapse of the lower part of the rock glacier: the lower part of the rock glacier breaks down as a debris flow and is totally removed * Very strong acceleration of the rock glacier: the a cceleration speeds up to very high values. One case is known so far, were velocities reached values as high as 80 m/yr ! The expected effects of velocity changes can be eit her local and limited to the rockglacier surface, or affect the downslope area : * Veloctiy increase will induce increased damage to i nfrastructures built on rockglaciers. * Strong acceleration will increase the surface instability, and the formation of scarps can lead to local rockfall hazard on the rockglacier surface. * Velocity increase will induce increased rockfall ac tivity on the rockglacier front, as well as a progression of the front. * Partial or total rupture and collapse can occur in a few cases, and threaten potentially large areas downslope. * Where rockglacier fronts are overhanging steep slopes or <b>torrential</b> <b>catchments,</b> secondary processes mobilizing the released debris can induce an increased hazard downslope. The following recommendations can be made in order to reduce hazard due to rockglaciers : * Infrastructures on rockglaciers should be avoided. * The zones in front of active rockglaciers should be avoided. * If the front of an active rockglacier is overhanging a steep slope, a security zone should be observed downslope of the rockglacier, with conside ration of potential direct and indirect processes like rockfalls and debris flows. * Paths and trails crossing rockglaciers or passing in front of rockglaciers should be regularly checked for security...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{hydrology}} {{and sediment}} yield and its scale dependency {{has been limited}} by {{the quantity and quality}} of instrumental data. This paper aims to apply alternative methods to estimate runoff and sediment production rates at the event-scale and to characterize the hydro-sedimentary response of a highly <b>torrential</b> Mediterranean <b>catchment</b> to historical changes in land use and vegetation. A selection of well-dated and spatially-distributed check dams within the catchment were used to calibrate and validate a hydro-sedimentary distributed model (TETIS). Sediment volumes deposited by individual runoff events and trapped in check dams were estimated on the bases of detailed stratigraphic descriptions and subsequent GPS/TLS surveys. The model results showed a good agreement with the observed water flows and sediment volumes deposited behind several check dams. Management and land uses proved to be a decisive factor in the hydrological behaviour of the catchment, especially affecting erosion and sediment yield. It was observed that while the hydrological response of the catchment was sensitive to the percentage of each land use type, the sedimentary response was more dependent on the spatial distribution of land use. These differences between hydrology and sedimentary behaviour imply that the optimal soil use distribution for soil conservation may differ from the optimal soil use scenario oriented to attenuate flood peaks. This study suggest that soil use policies and erosion mitigation strategies should consider a holistic hydro-sedimentary approach, in order to become an adaptive option to reduce and mitigate the effects of erosion and flood peaks under global change.
