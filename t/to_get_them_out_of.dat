25|$|Three {{years later}} the capital was {{restructured}} and the company {{was taken out of}} Judicial Management. PUTCO pioneers began giving aptitude tests to potential drivers. A year later it also introduced advertising on the sides of its buses. On 7 January 1957 workers from Johannesburg and Pretoria townships began a boycott of PUTCO, due to the company increasing fares by 25% (one penny at that time) in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a continuous financial crisis. This spontaneous act marked the start of a three-month period during which an estimated 70,000 workers joined in the action, which became known as the 1957 Alexandra Bus Boycott. PUTCO was forced to rescind the increase in the bus fare.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, {{the insurgents}} {{occupied}} buildings in northern Anahuac. Bradburn {{worried that the}} armed men wanted {{to do more than}} free the American prisoners; he suspected a full-scale revolt. Bradburn had Travis and Jack tied to the ground with weapons pointed at them. Bradburn threatened to shoot both men if the Texians attacked. Travis encouraged Johnson to lead an attack anyway. During the ensuing negotiations, the Texians offered to exchange the cavalry officers for Travis and the other prisoners. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody in exchange for the cavalry officers and for the withdrawal of the Texians to Turtle Bayou. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, between 15 and 30 of them remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and warned that he would begin firing on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had lied to them just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the buildings they had occupied. Unbeknownst to the Texians at the time, the buildings contained extra ammunition and supplies.|$|E

500|$|Two years later, the [...] "pom-pom" [...] {{directors}} {{were moved to}} the rear corners of the bridge <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the funnel gases. Another [...] "pom-pom" [...] director was added on the rear superstructure, abaft the HACS director in 1938. Two HACS Mark III {{directors were}} added to the aft end of the signal platform the following year, and the Mark I director aft was replaced by a Mark III. During Hoods last refit in 1941, a Type 279 air warning radar and a Type 284 gunnery radar were installed, although the Type 279 radar lacked its receiving aerial and was inoperable.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the {{decision}} to extend an amnesty to the mutineer sailors engendered much criticism from Brazil's upper classes. As historian Zachary Morgan put it, [...] "for the elite, {{the intention of the}} naval renovation itself was to fix their institution, propelling Brazil to the front of a South American arms race, and to make their navy competitive with that of any Western nation. Instead, enlisted men had used those very ships to humiliate the naval elite. The ships were saved, but at what cost?" [...] These sailors were given shore leave on the day the revolt ended (26 November). In the next days, the ships were disarmed to prevent a recurrence of events, and the rebels were discharged from the navy as threats to the service's discipline—nearly 1,300 of them, a drop so drastic that the Brazilian Navy was forced to pay for Portuguese merchant crewmen to fill the gaps. The government later claimed that over 1,000 of the dismissed sailors were given tickets to their home states <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the capital.|$|E
500|$|The Albums 2000–2010 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most reviewers. A writer from The Sun awarded the box set a perfect five star rating, stating [...] "Whether you like hot-pant Kylie, indie Kylie, girl-next-door Kylie or dark Kylie, there's something for every Kylie fan {{in this special}} box-set. Made up of five albums and celebrating ten years of tunes, we challenge you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your head." [...] Scott Harrah from Stagezine awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, but did not review the box set; instead, he reviewed each album individually because [...] "all [...] are so different in both sound and concept." [...] Jon O'Brien from AllMusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, labelling her earlier work as [...] "infectious". Despite being critical towards the lack of inclusion of her 1994–1998 Deconstruction work, and the inclusion of her albums, X, and Aphrodite, he concluded [...] "Kylie {{has yet to make}} that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steiner {{and his men}} {{standing}} eyeball-to-eyeball with the 300 armed Italians, relayed to the Pentagon [...] "I am not worried about our situation. We have the firepower to prevail. But I am concerned about the immaturity of the Italian troops. ...A backfire from a motorbike or a construction cart could precipitate a shooting incident {{that could lead to}} a lot of Italian casualties. And I don't believe that our beef is with our ally, the Italians, but rather with the terrorists." [...] The American leadership in Washington concluded that while Steiner and his men could take the terrorists it was unlikely they would be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Italy. By 4:00a.m. CET the next day, orders arrived for Steiner and his men to stand down.|$|E

2500|$|Empire.com ranked him #46 {{in their}} list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, praising {{the look on his}} face when he {{strangles}} a cop with his own handcuffs and that [...] "when American novelist Cormac McCarthy wants to throw a dark character at you, it's a safe assumption that you're not going to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your head for a good, long while - if ever. One of his best is Chigurh, and between the Coens and Bardem, they never missed a beat in bringing this monster to the screen. With the kind of unholy relentlessness usually reserved for horror icons, the hired killer has an almost supernatural ability to track his prey, and is rather short in the mercy department, preferring to leave the tough decisions to a coin toss. And that bowl cut is utterly terrifying." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 28, 2006, at a White House {{reception}} for those newly elected to Congress, Webb {{did not choose}} {{to wait in the}} line to have his picture taken with the president, whom Webb often criticized during the campaign. The president approached Webb later and asked him, [...] "How's your boy?", referring to Webb's son, a Marine serving in Iraq. Webb replied [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Iraq, Mr. President." [...] Bush responded, [...] "That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?", Webb responded, [...] "That's between me and my boy, Mr. President." [...] The Hill cited an anonymous source who claimed that Webb was so angered by the exchange that he confessed he was tempted to [...] "slug" [...] the president. Webb later remarked in an interview, [...] "I'm not particularly interested in having a picture of me and George W. Bush on my wall." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thompson and {{his crew}} {{witnessed}} an unarmed woman being kicked and shot at point-blank range by Captain Medina, who later claimed that he thought she had a hand grenade. Thompson then saw a group of civilians (again consisting of children, women, and old men) at a bunker being approached by ground personnel. Thompson landed and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the Vietnamese while he was trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bunker {{that they were to}} open fire on these soldiers. Thompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant (identified as Stephen Brooks of 2nd Platoon) and told him there were women and children in the bunker, and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out. According to Thompson, [...] "he [...] said {{the only way to get}} them out was with a hand grenade". Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to [...] "just hold your men right where they are, and I'll get the kids out". He found 12–16people in the bunker, coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter, standing with them while they were flown out in two groups.|$|E

2500|$|Corrupt county {{commissioner}} Jefferson Davis (J.D.) [...] "Boss" [...] Hogg, who either runs or has fingers in virtually everything in Hazzard County, is forever {{angry with the}} Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, for always foiling his crooked schemes. He is always looking for ways <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the picture so that his plots {{have a chance of}} succeeding. Many episodes revolve around Hogg trying to engage in an illegal scheme, sometimes with aid of hired criminal help. Some of these are get-rich-quick schemes, though many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and often tries to frame Bo and Luke for various crimes as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg's latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and put it out of business. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue (see below), Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions, as he believes they are generally out to get him.|$|E
