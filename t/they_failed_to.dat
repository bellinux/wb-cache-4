Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E

The Malmö FF team won Allsvenskan five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, but had to contest these play-offs each time to claim the national title. Though they won the play-offs in 1986 and 1988, <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> do so in 1985, 1987 and 1989, and therefore were not Swedish champions those years.|$|E
