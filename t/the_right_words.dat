25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words,</b> while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E

500|$|While {{composing}} the song's lyrics, Martin {{could not}} find <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words.</b> He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend {{who happened to be}} present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{started working}} on the album in mid-July 2000. While {{compiling}} songs for Sweet Kisses, she had expressed inconvenience when a track's lyrics were too suggestive or delivered a message she {{did not agree with}} and thus asked for its modification. However, for Irresistible, she decided to let Tommy Mottola, the CEO of Columbia, take control of the whole project. He enlisted many established composers and producers for the album, hand-picked each song for the track list, and rejected those he felt were not so good. Although she had previously announced that she would write a few songs for her second album, Simpson does not share songwriting credits on any of the tracks. On being asked why, she said that she was very shy when it came to songwriting and felt that it requires a lot of [...] "bravery" [...] to write songs. She also expressed that she could not find <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words</b> for the songs and hence did not write for the record. According to Simpson, the album did not have a definite concept or theme; Mottola selected songs which they felt were good enough for Simpson and compiled them into an album.|$|E

Woods compared the band to Panic! at the Disco [...] "without the bounce or the creativity" [...] saying the album [...] "takes the bastardisation of honest musical forms to new heights." [...] Dan MacIntosh of PopMatters felt the songs as [...] "sound like high school gossip." [...] He {{went on to}} note the album has: [...] "Over-the-top drama" [...] combined with [...] "stripped-down, pop-rock hooks," [...] which {{for the most part}} [...] "prevent overbearing emotional mood swings." [...] He concluded by mentioning the band has [...] "much to say, but lacks <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words</b> to say it all." [...] The Skinny reviewer Billy Hamilton noted the album was [...] "Brimming with slickly produced pre-pubescent punk-pop" [...] that made [...] "Blink 182 seem like nihilists." [...] He considered the sound as being [...] "faux-guitar music for a generation yet to move on from the tweeny-rock of Busted." [...] In an artist spotlight for Spin, writer Alyssa Rashbaum described the album as [...] "energetic, youthful power-pop about high school cliques, drama-loving girls, and fake IDs." ...|$|E

Choir singers from the Purasawalkam and Vepery areas of Chennai were used in the song. According to film historian and actor Mohan V. Raman, [...] "Kannadasan could not get <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words</b> nor was there a tune ready and Sivaji came to the composing and did a pantomime of what he would like to do and thus was born the line and the song". Cellist R. Selvaraj, whose father {{was a part of the}} orchestration for [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] said 250 instrumentalists were used for playing different instruments in sync. Other sources state that Viswanathan used over 300 instruments for the song. The music directors tried over 100 different ways of composing the tune of [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] before the song was recorded. It was based on the raga Bilaskhani Todi. S. S. Vasan of The Hindu Tamil compared the sombre moments in [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] to that of the song [...] "Mujhko Is Raat Ki Tanhai Me" [...] from Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960).

Simon goes on in the interview to explain the process of how he goes about writing songs, [...] "The music always precedes the words.

2500|$|Filled pauses {{consist of}} repetitions of syllables and words, {{reformulation}} or false starts where speakers rephrase their speech {{to fit the}} representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words</b> in one's lexicon to carry across an intended meaning. There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur.
