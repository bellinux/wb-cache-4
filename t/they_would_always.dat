5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E

25|$|Claiming {{continental}} European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry {{when they}} next applied {{to join the}} community in December 1967 under the Labour leadership of Harold Wilson. During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying {{too much on the}} Americans, saying that sooner or later <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> do what was in their best interests. Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany {{as a result of the}} EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk. After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.|$|E

On stage, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>always</b> begin gigs acoustically, before finishing with electric guitars. Constant gigging in London helped the band build up a following, and in December 1982, they played four shows with U2. These shows were {{the first time that}} Bono joined The Alarm on stage.|$|R
25|$|Lair {{knew that}} his {{superiors}} felt that the hostilities in Laos could be settled only one of two ways: either direct military intervention with American troops, or a surrender of Laos to communism. With this in mind, Lair took the offer back to his superior, Desmond Fitzgerald, with the observation that Vang Pao already had gathered 4,300 potential Hmong recruits. Lair's expressed opinion was that the Hmong were the only potential fighting force between the North Vietnamese invasion and Vientiane. He believed the Hmong would defend {{their way of life}} with ongoing guerrilla raids that would tie the Vietnamese down. Moreover, a functional guerrilla force would be best instructed by Thai PARU because they shared a commonly intelligible language. The absence of Caucasian faces in the operation would guarantee plausible deniability for the covert operation. The only caveat in Lair's expertise was that the Hmong could never fight for fixed positions as infantry would; <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> need a line of retreat.|$|E

The other was that the Hmong militia would be tasked with offensive operations in enemy territory, to expand Royalist holdings.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} a cold open in which Rose, via narration, recollects her life with the Doctor and her belief that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be {{travelling}} together. She then mentions that this episode is [...] "the story of how I died".|$|E
60|$|At {{this time}} there was in the palace a knight who was called Sir Red. He was very well liked by the king, but hated by {{everyone}} else, for he was wicked both in will and deed.

500|$|The series {{follows the}} Hair Bear Bunch, {{a group of}} three bear cousins who live at the local Wonderland Zoo. They also serve as the [...] "wacky heroes" [...] of the show. [...] The three bears would {{occasionally}} escape their luxurious cage to ride on their [...] "invisible motorcycle"; however, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> return to the cage before Mr. Peevly or Lionel Botch were able to catch them. The bears had several motives for pranking and fooling Mr. Peevly and Mr. Botch, including trying to [...] "improve their living conditions" [...] and wanting to [...] "embark on get-rich-quick schemes". The bears also wore clothes; according to author Christoper P. Lehman, Hanna-Barbera [...] "dress the bears in counterculture apparel" [...] in order to stay on track with the [...] "mainstream" [...] fashion in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Otherwise, Shinbo granted Urobuchi a {{large amount}} of {{autonomy}} in writing the series and determining the path of the story. In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while collaborating on the series, Urobuchi commented that [...] "neither one is the type to show their hand, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> wait for me to make the next move." [...] In his effort to create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre, Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were [...] "troubling or overlooked". He also stated that the development of the plot was heavily influenced by the character drawings he saw Aoki design. Other inspirations he credited for contributing to the series included horror fiction author Stephen King as well as previous projects that Shinbo directed such as Hidamari Sketch and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.|$|E
500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{fell into}} early debt; his wife began loaning him {{tens of thousands}} of dollars to keep it alive. [...] Donations also came in from Jim Hensley and other Hensley & Co. executives, but the amounts grew large enough that the Federal Election Commission forced some of it to be returned. [...] By the close of the primary, McCain was able to outspend his opponents; more of than half of his primary expenditures were financed by the eventual $167,000 that his wife lent to the campaign. [...] (The McCains had made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns. [...] In the end, $93,000 of the 1982 loan would be forgiven.) [...] The spending advantage made itself felt in television advertising, including a highly effective two-minute mini-documentary that presented him as new leader for Arizona with a record of service to the country. [...] Rival Mack later called that ad the best political commercial he had ever seen.|$|E

60|$|It delighted Kennedy {{to watch}} their improvement. The first side they played ran through them {{to the tune of}} three goals and four tries to a try, and it took all the efforts of the Head of the house to keep a spirit of pessimism from {{spreading}} in the ranks. Another frost of this sort, and the sprouting keenness of the house would be nipped in the bud. He conducted himself with much tact. Another captain might have made the fatal error of trying to stir his team up with pungent abuse. He realised what a mistake this would be. It did not need a great deal of discouragement to send the house back to its old slack ways. Another such defeat, following immediately in the footsteps of the first, and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> begin to ask themselves what was the good of mortifying the flesh simply to get a licking from a scratch team by twenty-four points. Kay's, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> feel, <b>always</b> had got beaten, and <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>would,</b> to the end of time.

500|$|The band's {{penchant for}} {{addressing}} {{political and social}} issues, {{as well as their}} staid depiction in Corbijn's black-and-white sleeve photographs, contributed to the group's earnest and serious image as [...] "stone-faced pilgrim". This image became a target for derision after the band's critically maligned Rattle and Hum project in 1988. Various critics called them [...] "po-faced", [...] "pompous bores", and [...] "humourless". The group's continued exploration of American music for the project was labelled [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "misguided and bombastic". After Bono told fans on the 1989 Lovetown Tour that U2 would [...] "dream it all up again", the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s. They incorporated alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and adopted a more ironic, flippant image by which they embraced the [...] "rock star" [...] identity they struggled with in the 1980s. Bono referred to their 1991 album Achtung Baby as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree". Author Bill Flanagan summarised the impact of The Joshua Tree on the group's career in his liner notes for the album's 20th anniversary release: [...] "The Joshua Tree made U2 into international rock stars and established both a standard <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> have to live up to and an image they would forever try to live down." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{off-season}} {{after the}} 2007 Series showed {{a war of}} words between management of both teams. Boston GM Theo Epstein called Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina a [...] "bad apple" [...] for complaining about the Yankees' 2004 trip to Japan as the Red Sox were gearing up for their own trip there. Epstein claimed that Mussina had {{used it as a}} crutch during the season. Mussina retorted back saying [...] "Yea, we used it as a crutch to win the division!" [...] Later that month, Hank Steinbrenner, who had taken a bigger role with the Yankees operation from his father George, responded in a feisty manner to the popularity of Red Sox Nation in The New York Times supplemental Play Magazine: Red Sox Nation?' What a bunch of (expletive) that is. That was a creation of the Red Sox and ESPN, which is filled with Red Sox fans. Go anywhere in America and you won't see Red Sox hats and jackets, you'll see Yankee hats and jackets. This is a Yankee country. We're going to put the Yankees back on top and restore the universe to order." [...] In response, Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry inducted Hank Steinbrenner into Red Sox Nation. Steinbrenner went on to praise Henry's handling of the Red Sox and said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be competitive under him.|$|E
500|$|Night Trap was {{developed}} over {{six months and}} was part movie shoot, and part programming. The film was shot on 35 mm film in Culver City, CA across 16 days in 1987, with editing taking another few months. The film was directed by James Riley. The director of photography was Don Burgess, who later went on to shoot the award-winning Forrest Gump (1994). Originally the set {{was going to be}} darker, but it was made brighter for fear the footage would pixelate in-game. The script was unusual because it was built around the multi-linear gameplay. Riley was focused on timing the shoots correctly to sync the movement of actors among the rooms. There were four scenes occurring simultaneously at any given time, although there were eight rooms (the other four being still images). Dana Plato was the most famous actor involved, known for her work on the American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes (1978–86). Plato's career was spiraling downward at the time, partially due to her personal problems with drugs and alcohol. At first, she was eager to work on Night Trap, but later she became more problematic. She reportedly made little effort {{to hide the fact that}} doing this project was a huge step down from her previous popularity. The Augers were played by stuntmen. They developed a hobbling walk so that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be prepared to fall when the traps dropped under their feet. The software {{was developed}} concurrently with the filming and editing. Through developing Night Trap, Fulop and his team came to realize their old-fashioned development methods did not always work with interactive movies. The team could not go back and [...] "tweak" [...] on-screen elements and other assets, such as inserting new scenes or changing the time an actor comes into view. They had to work with the video footage they were handed over.|$|E
5000|$|The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service [...] "defined {{the three}} groups of {{undesirable}} civil servants and provided for their dismissal". The first group included {{those who had been}} appointed after November 9, 1918, and could be removed if they did not have the proper training, which essentially meant anyone could fit into these standards. The Second group were those who were deemed by their past that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> support the national state. The third group were any non-Aryans, a way of excluding the Jews without explicitly mentioning 'Jews' in the legislation.|$|R
6000|$|Marion {{was indeed}} {{delighted with the}} news. The thought of leaving {{her mother and father}} behind had been the one {{drawback}} to her happiness. She had been her mother's right hand and her father's companion. She had thought how terribly <b>they</b> <b>would</b> miss her, and how, as years went on, <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> far more than now, feel the difference between their present life and that they had formerly led. The news that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be <b>always</b> near her and settled in a comfortable home filled her with delight. A few minutes after Mr. Atherton entered the house she ran out to her father and mother and threw her arms fondly around them. [...] "Is it not happiness, mother," [...] she cried, [...] "to think that we shall still be together?" ...|$|R
60|$|When Hodder {{had reached}} {{the foot of the}} stairs, Alison came out to him. The {{mourning}} she wore made her seem even taller. In the face upturned to his, framed in the black veil and paler than he had known it, were traces of tears; in the eyes a sad, yet questioning and trustful smile. They gazed at each other an instant, before speaking, in the luminous ecstasy of perfect communion which shone for them, undimmed, in the surrounding gloom of tragedy. And thus, <b>they</b> felt, it <b>would</b> <b>always</b> shine. Of that tragedy of the world's sin and sorrow <b>they</b> <b>would</b> ever be conscious. Without darkness there could be no light.|$|R

In {{a letter to a}} friend who had become engaged around this time, the 30‑year‑old Kipling offered this sombre counsel: marriage principally taught [...] "the tougher virtues—such as humility, restraint, order, and forethought." ...|$|E

He was a social Darwinist who {{believed}} in {{the survival of the}} fittest and wanted to create a new civilisation, contending that [...] "while war, slavery, and religion had once been necessary, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> be so; in the future only science could guarantee human progress". Nevertheless, the book [...] "drew attention to the immense tale of suffering and waste involved in the theory of evolution".|$|R
25|$|The Fujiwara {{retained}} {{enough power}} to prevent a plan to raise Dōkyō to Emperor in 769, known as the Dōkyō Incident. When Empress Shōtoku died in 770 without leaving any children, they managed to break the Imperial line of descendants of Emperor Temmu, which <b>they</b> thought <b>would</b> <b>always</b> favor direct imperial rule over control by a non-imperial clan like the Fujiwara. Dōkyō was sent into exile and several Fujiwara leaders were appointed to prominent government positions. According to Zachert, the political instability and threat to the imperial line of succession due to Dōkyō during Kōken/Shōtoku's rule acted as a deterrent and Japan would not see another female ruler for close to 1000 years.|$|R

The use of these treatments peaked in the 1950s. In her book Madness in Its Place: Narratives of Severalls Hospital, 1913-1997, Diana Gittins notes that often women were admitted by their own family, sometimes as the result of bearing illegitimate children or because they had been raped. As <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> (or were unable to) carry out daily tasks, they were considered to be insane and some were even subjected to ECT and lobotomy. A change in management during the 1960s (and likely a change in social acceptance) saw reforms introduced including the creation of art and music therapy programs and the widespread use of drugs and medication.|$|R
