50|$|From the Geist and Lambin (2002) study {{described}} in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor {{played a significant role}} in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%). The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%). Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%). The main <b>technological</b> <b>factor</b> was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices. Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%). Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density — a result of the first factor — in those areas (25%).|$|E

As systems and technologies are being improved and developed, discussions on their effectiveness and evaluation on their success have been continuously debated by researchers, scholars and practitioners. Besides the major concern on IS effectiveness, factors influencing IS effectiveness are also important. Hence, this study was conducted to investigate the influence of <b>technological</b> <b>factors</b> on Delone and McLean’s IS success dimension. Using a survey method, data were gathered from 201 users from four electronic government agencies in Malaysia. The <b>technological</b> <b>factors</b> were represented by IS competency, IS facilities, IS integration, IS structure and user support. The IS success dimensions used in the study were systems quality, information quality, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction. The findings indicate that all the <b>technological</b> <b>factors</b> are significantly correlated with the four IS success dimensions. The study concludes that the <b>technological</b> <b>factors</b> investigated were very important in ensuring the successful utilization and implementation of information systems in the electronic government agencies...|$|R

50|$|The {{next step}} is to link these drivers {{together}} to provide a meaningful framework. This may be obvious, where some of the factors are clearly related to each other in one way or another. For instance, a <b>technological</b> <b>factor</b> may lead to market changes, but may be constrained by legislative factors. On the other hand, some of the 'links' (or at least the 'groupings') may need to be artificial at this stage. At a later stage more meaningful links may be found, or the factors may then be rejected from the scenarios. In the most theoretical approaches to the subject, probabilities are attached to the event strings. This is difficult to achieve, however, and generally adds little - except complexity - to the outcomes. This is probably the most (conceptually) difficult step. It is where managers' 'intuition' - their ability to make sense of complex patterns of 'soft' data which more rigorous analysis would be unable to handle - plays an important role. There are, however, a range of techniques which can help; and again the Post-It-Notes approach is especially useful: Thus, the participants try to arrange the drivers, which have emerged from the first stage, into groups which seem to make sense to them. Initially there may be many small groups. The intention should, therefore, be to gradually merge these (often having to reform them from new combinations of drivers to make these bigger groups work). The aim of this stage is eventually to make 6-8 larger groupings; 'mini-scenarios'. Here the Post-It Notes may be moved dozens of times over the length - perhaps several hours or more - of each meeting. While this process is taking place the participants will probably want to add new topics - so more Post-It Notes are added to the wall. In the opposite direction, the unimportant ones are removed (possibly to be grouped, again as an 'audit trail' on another wall). More important, the 'certain' topics are also removed from the main area of debate - in this case they must be grouped in clearly labelled area of the main wall. As the clusters - the 'mini-scenarios' - emerge, the associated notes may be stuck to each other rather than individually to the wall; which makes it easier to move the clusters around (and is a considerable help during the final, demanding stage to reducing the scenarios to two or three). The great benefit of using Post-It Notes {{is that there is no}} bar to participants changing their minds. If they want to rearrange the groups - or simply to go back (iterate) to an earlier stage - then they strip them off and put them in their new position.|$|E

This study aims to clarify the factors based on three main elements include personal, community and <b>technological</b> <b>factor.</b> Through out the study, the most preferred electronic collaboration tools employed and the benefit of online knowledge sharing may also be presented. The quantitative method is applied for this study, combining the manual and online distribution of questionnaires to the respondents. The questionnaire is designed with both open ended and close ended questions. The study explored the online knowledge sharing factors by classifying the main element into several sub independent variables. The findings show that <b>technological</b> <b>factor</b> is the most contributed online knowledge sharing factor. As for <b>technological</b> <b>factor,</b> it is seen that perceived efficacy represent the most important influencer with the highest mean. Most respondents agree that without the technology tools, they may not successfully involve and participated in sharing knowledge virtually.
