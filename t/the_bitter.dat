5|$|Like most Tylopilus species, {{the fruit}} bodies of T.plumbeoviolaceous are not {{recommended}} for consumption because of its bitter taste. The presence of a bitter bolete may spoil a meal, as <b>the</b> <b>bitter</b> taste does not disappear with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Unlike typical vomiting, the {{regurgitation}} {{is typically}} described as effortless and unforced. There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks <b>the</b> <b>bitter</b> taste and odour of stomach acid and bile.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. <b>The</b> <b>bitter</b> taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask <b>the</b> <b>bitter</b> taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E

5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} {{in a shallow}} phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle.

5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has <b>the</b> <b>bitter</b> or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|Here he {{met some}} of his lifelong friends and colleagues: Martin Tranmæl, Oscar Torp and Einar Gerhardsen.

5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until <b>the</b> <b>bitter</b> end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E

At this time Fairbrother was replaced by another Pakeha officer, Major Russell Young, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently led the battalion until July 1944.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bitter</b> {{rivalry between}} Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia flared up in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football during the United States' involvement in World War I. Because Tech {{was a military}} training ground, it had a complete assembly of male students. Many schools, such as UGA, lost all of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, forcing them to temporarily suspend football during the war. In fact, UGA did not play a game from 1917 to 1918.|$|E
5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for <b>the</b> <b>bitter</b> taste has not been identified.|$|E

5|$|Immortalité almost reached safety. On {{the morning}} of 20 October, Captain Jean-François Legrand was {{approaching}} Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Fisgard. Fisgard, part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. Immortalité initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster Fisgard at 11:00. During <b>the</b> <b>bitter,</b> close–range action, Fisgard took severe damage and almost lost her opponent. Immortalité, which had lost a mast and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard Immortalité were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General Monge (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead. Fisgard, {{with the aid of}} other ships of the blockade squadron, successfully brought her prize into port.|$|E
