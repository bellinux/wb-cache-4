5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.|$|E

25|$|The Third Symphony was a {{transitional}} work. Glazunov admitted its composition caused {{him a great}} deal of trouble. With the Fourth Symphony, he came into his mature style. Dedicated to Anton Rubinstein, the Fourth was written as a deliberately cosmopolitan work by a Russian looking outward to the West, yet it remained unmistakably Russian in tone. He continued to synthesize nationalist tradition and Western technique in the Fifth Symphony. By the time Glazunov wrote his Seventh Symphony, his duties at the Conservatory had slowed his rate of composition. After his Eighth Symphony, his heavy drinking may have started <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on his creativity, as well. He sketched one movement of a Ninth Symphony but left the work unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Ben {{had never}} shown {{interest}} in “boy” toys, {{they wanted to}} wear girl’s clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child’s gender identity is extremely important.|$|E

500|$|Akshay Kumar {{played a}} fictitious gangster based on Dawood Ibrahim. Kumar's character's look was {{revealed}} on {{a reality show}} on Aapka Colors. Kumar's entrance on the show {{was supposed to be}} accompanied by music after a scene from the prequel (choreographed by director Milan Luthria), followed by an action sequence. The scene had a [...] "minor glitch", believed to be a failed attempt to sabotage Kumar's entrance. The scene was performed twice, <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on Kumar's back and leading to the cancellation of a public appearance. The film would reportedly feature a scene with Kumar watching a cricket match, but whether the match was between India and Pakistan at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium during the 1980s was unconfirmed. The trailer premiered in Mumbai, where many of the film's outdoor scenes were shot. To promote the film, Kumar flew from New York (where he was on holiday with his family) to Birmingham to watch the India-Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy match on 15 June 2013 at Edgbaston Cricket Ground. A second trailer of the film was released on 3 July 2013, with narration by Kumar's character (Shoaib Khan), revealing plot details such as the rivalry between Kumar's and Imran Khan's characters for Jasmine's love. The trailer described Khan as the film's antihero, featuring action sequences between Shoaib Khan and Aslam (Imran Khan).

2500|$|By the mid-1970s, however, {{managerial}} neglect was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the park's condition. [...] "Years of poor {{management and}} inadequate maintenance {{had turned a}} masterpiece of landscape architecture into a virtual dustbowl by day and a danger zone by night", {{in the opinion of}} Douglas Blonsky, a president of the Central Park Conservancy. Vandalism, territorial use (e.g. a pick-up game of softball or association football, which commandeered open space and excluded others), and illicit activities were taking place in the park. Several volunteer citizen groups emerged, intent upon reclaiming the park by fundraising and organizing volunteer initiatives. One of these groups, the Central Park Community Fund, commissioned a study of the park's management. The study's conclusion was bi-linear; it called for establishment of a single position within the New York City Parks Department, responsible for overseeing both the planning and management of Central Park, as well as a board of guardians to provide citizen oversight.|$|E
