It started {{to become more}} organized on September 13 and the National Hurricane Center began <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> closely for further development. Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from the wave on September 17 when it was 350miles (560km) east of Barbados. The depression strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Philippe that evening, and the official forecasts correctly indicated that Philippe would move northwards and not approach the Lesser Antilles despite climatology suggesting {{an impact on the}} islands.|$|E
5|$|With one day {{left before}} {{his meeting with}} Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they {{apparently}} have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears {{the sound of the}} mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The largest French {{resupply}} {{effort of}} the Napoleonic Wars was a squadron under Contre-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, sent to Santo Domingo in December 1805 with troops and supplies. In conjunction with a second squadron under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, this force was then ordered to raid British trade routes and disrupt the movement of British merchant shipping across the Atlantic. Leissègues reached Santo Domingo in February 1806, but within days a British battle squadron had intercepted and destroyed his force at the Battle of San Domingo. Willaumez was able to avoid attack by British forces {{during the spring of}} 1806, and cruised in the Caribbean during much of the summer, but his force was eventually dispersed by a hurricane in August and the survivors forced to shelter on the American Eastern Seaboard. Unaware of the dispersal of Willaumez's squadron, the British naval authorities sought to block its return to Europe by stationing strong battle squadrons off the principal French Atlantic ports. One of their most important targets was the city of Rochefort, heavily fortified port in which a powerful French naval force was based, and a squadron of six Royal Navy ships of the line was assigned <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> in case Willaumez attempted to return there. In August, command of the blockade squadron was awarded to Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, a highly experience naval commander.|$|E

5000|$|However, co-director Andrew Loo had {{traveled}} {{all over the}} United States with the film, and said: [...] "I've found that {{this is actually a}} real-audience film.....In terms of audience reception, I don't think we've ever had a 'bad' screening. It's interesting that the critics hate the film because it's not an easy film <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> <b>It's</b> a genre film dressed up as an art house film because you have Marty's Scorsese's name on it." ...|$|R

25|$|The episode's {{central theme}} is ineffectual protest. The {{plot of the}} Church's {{opposition}} to a blasphemous film {{was inspired by the}} reaction to several real-world films, including The Last Temptation of Christ, Sebastiane, Hail Mary and Monty Python's Life of Brian; the latter was banned in Ireland upon its release, so Linehan joined a film club specifically to get a chance <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hawkins is {{credited}} with {{the selection of the}} Alamogordo area for the Trinity nuclear test, but he declined <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it.</b> His final assignment at Los Alamos was as its historian, writing the history of Project Y.

50|$|This line of thinking, in turn, {{may reflect}} a {{non-standard}} measure of utility, which is ultimately subjective and unique to the consumer. A ticket-buyer who purchases a ticket to an event they won't enjoy in advance makes a semi-public commitment <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> leave early is to make this lapse of judgment manifest to strangers, an appearance they might otherwise choose to avoid. Alternatively, they may take pride in having recognized the opportunity cost of the alternative use of time.|$|R

25|$|The East German {{political}} establishment excessively promoted the picture, as well; It was officially {{classified as a}} documentary, and all servicemen of the Barracked People's Police were obliged <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it.</b> However, The Fall of Berlin was received with little enthusiasm by the populace. Years later, in an article he wrote for the Deutsche Filmkunst magazine on 30 October 1959, Sigfried Silbermann – {{director of the state}} film distributor Progress-Film Verleih – attributed this response to the effect years of anti-Soviet propaganda had on the German people.|$|E
25|$|In The Movies, players get {{the chance}} to run their own movie studio. The game can be divided into three main areas – {{designing}} the movie studio, forging the careers of film stars and making films. It is possible to focus on any of those areas that appeal most, and spend less time on the others. The game plays through from the birth of cinema to the present day and into the near future, with all the technology and historical advances that occur along that timeline. After the movies have been made, they can be played back for the viewer <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> <b>It</b> is possible once the movie is made to add voice, text and music in post-production.|$|E

5000|$|Negative reviews {{appeared}} in The Chicago Reader, in which Andrea Gronvall {{commented that the}} film is [...] "ass-numbingly wrong", and Rolling Stone, in which Peter Travers referred <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "being trapped with a person of privilege who won't stop with the whine whine whine." [...] Humor website Something Awful ran a scathing review. Martin R. [...] "Vargo" [...] Schneider highlighted several aspects of the film that he considered completely unrealistic.

As of the shows one-year anniversary, average viewership dipped 15 percent, to 285,000. The 25-54 demo was down 24 percent, to 123,000. The shows second anniversary episode on February 5, 2009, however, showed {{significant}} improvement: Red Eye averaged 390,000 viewers, with 166,000 in the 25-54 demo.

25|$|Educational and {{industrial}} films form an entire subgenre of camp films, {{with the most}} famous being the much-spoofed 1950s Duck and Cover film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart Protect and Survive {{could be seen as}} kitsch, even though it is very chilling <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> (<b>it</b> was never shown on grounds of National security and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British Public Information Films gained a camp cult following, such as the famous Charley Says series. Interestingly, Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ Kenny Everett, who came from an advertising background as a copywriter.|$|E
25|$|Cameron next {{began the}} sequel to Alien, the 1979 film by Ridley Scott. Cameron named the sequel Aliens and again cast Sigourney Weaver in the iconic role of Ellen Ripley. According to Cameron, the crew on Aliens was hostile to him, {{regarding}} him as a poor substitute for Ridley Scott. Cameron sought to show them The Terminator {{but the majority of}} the crew refused <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> and remained skeptical of his direction throughout production. Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors when Michael Biehn of Terminator took James Remar's place as Corporal Hicks), Aliens became a box-office success. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Weaver, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and won awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of TIME magazine as a result of numerous and extensive scenes of women in combat; these were almost without precedent and expressed the feminist theme of the film very strongly.|$|E

25|$|Development {{arrives in}} Ilmorog as the {{government}} begin to build the Trans-Africa road through the village, which brings an increase in trade. Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it {{to ensure that they}} own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies and the banks move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She opens up a successful brothel in the town, and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi.|$|E
25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

Both teams featured strong offenses, however they juxtaposed one another in that Washington State, as typical of Mike Leach-coached football teams, heavily relied on the passing game, whereas Colorado State relied heavily upon the running game.
