The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town.

5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, {{the city}} {{government}} proposed that {{the maintenance of the}} new trains be privatized.

The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies.

5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E

Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada also activated their CDERA response systems.

5|$|After the Norman {{invasion}} of 1066, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux {{and the new}} Earl of Kent, probably acquired the manor, which had by this time been lost by its former owners in Canterbury. The burh appears to have continued in use, either because the manor continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> {{in the same way}} as before, or because the occupation of the former elite site demonstrated the Normans' power over the local community. Odo's lands and those of the Archbishop of Canterbury bordered each other, and Eynsford fell within an area mainly controlled by Canterbury. The Italian monk Lanfranc became the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and set about attempting to recover the manor, probably finally doing so around 1082, when Odo was arrested by King William. Lanfranc assigned a knight called Ralph, probably a lay retainer from Normandy, to run the estate, and appointed Ralph's son, William de Enysford, to the role on his father's death.|$|E

5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle {{ceased to be}} a residence. The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> by Historic Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Terengganu {{was first}} {{designated}} as a local government area in 1928 through the Municipal and Health Enactment 1928. At this time, the area only covered {{a small part of}} the current city border, specifically the historic core around the river mouth. The area, nevertheless, was enlarged slowly. In 1950, the town was administrated by Kuala Terengganu Town Board under section 51(1), the Local Authority Election Ordinance 1950. Like many other town boards at that time, the process of town planning was carried out according to the Town Board Enactment 1930. Until 1979, the town continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> by Kuala Terengganu Town Board that governed an area of 5.4 square miles (1,398.6 hectares), with a population of around 53,300 people. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council (MPKT) was established due to the development that spilled over to the areas outside the jurisdiction of the former Town Board. MPKT was established on 18 January 1979 under the enforcement of the Local Government Act 1976. MPKT was created through the amalgamation of Kuala Terengganu Town Board and four local councils (North KT, South KT, West KT, and Central KT) with an area of 18,712 hectares covering 21 mukim or sub-districts, including some parts of Northern Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
