5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested}} in the possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William Morris (1899) in which he provided a sympathetic portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his political activities, treating <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> passing phase that Morris overcame.|$|E

5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for {{his style of}} returning the football; upon receiving the ball, he would run straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely. The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E
