50|$|Corticosteroids such as {{prednisone}} {{are often}} prescribed {{along with a}} blood pressure medication, typically an ACE inhibitor such as lisinopril. Some nephrologists will start out with the ACE inhibitor first {{in an attempt to}} reduce the blood pressure's force which pushes the protein through the cell wall in order to lower the amount of protein in the urine. In some cases, a corticosteroid may not be necessary if the case of minimal change disease is mild enough to be treated just with the ACE inhibitor. Often, the liver is overactive with minimal change disease in an attempt to replace lost protein and overproduces cholesterol. Therefore, a statin drug is often prescribed {{for the duration of the}} treatment. When the urine is clear of protein, the medications can be discontinued.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The lack of {{effective}} treatment for chronic transplant dysfunction restricts the long-term survival of solid organ allografts. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands can suppress vascular inflammation. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the effects of rosiglitazone on chronic transplant dysfunction in a rat cardiac transplant model. METHODS. Inbred male Fisher 344 (F 344, RT 1) and Lewis (LEW, RT 1) rats were subjected to heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation according to standard procedures. Cyclosporine A was administered intraperitoneally to cover acute rejection, and rosiglitazone was administered orally by gavage daily from 3 days before the operation to the end of experiments. RESULTS. Rosiglitazone significantly prolonged the survival of cardiac allografts in rats (F 344 to LEW) that had received a 10 -day course of cyclosporin A compared to <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>immunosuppressant</b> alone. Analysis of allografts at 120 days posttransplantation showed that rosiglitazone reduced the inflammatory cell infiltrate in both the vessels and graft parenchyma as were neointimal formation, vascular occlusion, and fibrosis. Expression of transforming growth factor-β and related proteins was less abundant after cyclosporin A/rosiglitazone treatment. CONCLUSIONS. The findings reported here demonstrate that rosiglitazone given under the cover of short-term <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> cyclosporin A prolongs cardiac allograft survival and reduces the severity of chronic transplant dysfunction. This may be mediated in part through the downregulation of transforming growth factor-β and related proteins.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsTreatment {{goals in}} {{inflammatory}} bowel diseases are evolving {{beyond the control}} of symptoms towards the tight control of objectively-measured gastrointestinal inflammation. This review discusses the progress and challenges in adopting a treat-to-target approach in inflammatory bowel diseases. MethodsEvidence from the literature that highlights current thinking in terms of treating-to-target in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases is discussed. ResultsMonitoring for objective evidence of inflammation using endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging or laboratory biomarkers may be a useful approach in inflammatory bowel diseases; however, setting the appropriate treatment goal remains a challenge. Deep remission (a composite of symptom control and mucosal healing) may now be a realistic target in Crohn's disease; however, it remains to be proven that achieving deep remission will modify the long-term disease course. Assessing prognosis at an early stage of the disease course is essential for the development of an appropriate management plan, with the rationale of adapting treatment to disease severity.

40|$|Background: Sex {{medicine}} {{studies have}} shown that there are sex differences with regard to disease characteristics in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, in immune response and susceptibility to viral infections. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Observational Study of infectious events in psoriasis complicated by active psoriatic arthritis (SYNERGY) study in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treated with immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine, in order to evaluate potential between-sex differences in severity of disease and prevalence of viral infections. Methods: SYNERGY was an observational study conducted in 24 Italian dermatology clinics, which included 238 consecutively enrolled patients <b>with</b> PsA, under <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>immunosuppressant</b> regimens including cyclosporin A. In this post hoc analysis, patients’ demographical data and clinical characteristics of psoriasis, severity and activity of PsA, prevalence of seropositivity for at least one viral infection, and treatments administered for PsA and infections were compared between sexes. Results: A total of 225 patients were evaluated in this post hoc analysis, and 121 (54 %) were males. Demographic characteristics and concomitant diseases were comparable between sexes. Statistically significant sex differences were observed at baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (higher in males), mean number of painful joints, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, and the global activity of disease assessed by patients (all higher in females). The percentage of patients with at least one seropositivity detected at baseline, indicative of concomitant or former viral infection, was significantly higher among women than among men. No between-sex differences were detected in other measures, at other time points, and in treatments. Patients developed no hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus reactivation during cyclosporine treatment. Conclusion: Our post hoc sex analysis suggests that women with PsA have a greater articular involvement and a higher activity of disease compared to males.

Methods: Electronic medical records from a tertiary care teaching hospital in south India were screened for SS between 2004 and 2011. Patients fulfilling American European Consensus group (AECG) 2002 or American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2012 classification criteria were included. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis to identify patterns of associations between clinical and immunological features was done. Multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of major systemic involvement was performed. Data on treatment and outcome were retrieved from electronic records.

40|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is {{a severe}} {{inflammatory}} CNS disorder of putative autoimmune aetiology, which predominantly affects {{the spinal cord}} and optic nerves. Recently, a highly specific serum reactivity to CNS microvessels, subpia and Virchow-Robin spaces was described in patients with NMO [called NMO-IgG (NMO-immunoglobulin G) ]. Subsequently, aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4), the most abundant water channel in the CNS, was identified as its target antigen. Strong support for a pathogenic role of the antibody would come from studies demonstrating a correlation between AQP 4 -Ab (AQP 4 -antibody) titres and the clinical course of disease. In this study, we determined AQP 4 -Ab serum levels in 96 samples from eight NMO-IgG positive patients (median follow-up 62 months) in a newly developed fluorescence-based immunoprecipitation assay employing recombinant human AQP 4. We found that AQP 4 -Ab serum levels correlate with clinical disease activity, with relapses being preceded by an up to 3 -fold increase in AQP 4 -Ab titres, which was not paralleled by a rise in other serum autoantibodies in one patient.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a novel nucleotide, 4 -pyridone 3 / 5 -carboxamide ribonucleoside triphosphate (4 PyTP), which accumulates in human erythrocytes during renal failure. Using plasma and erythrocyte extracts obtained from children with chronic renal failure we show that the concentration of 4 PyTP is increased, {{as well as other}} soluble NAD+ metabolites (nicotinamide, N 1 -methylnicotinamide and 4 Py-riboside) and the major nicotinamide metabolite N 1 -methyl- 2 -pyridone- 5 -carboxamide (2 PY), with increasing degrees of renal failure. We noted that 2 PY concentration was highest in the plasma of haemodialysis patients, while 4 PyTP was highest in erythrocytes of children undergoing peritoneal dialysis: its concentration correlated closely with 4 Py-riboside, an authentic precursor of 4 PyTP, in the plasma. In the dialysis patients, GTP concentration was elevated: similar accumulation was noted previously, as a paradoxical effect in erythrocytes during <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>immunosuppressants</b> such as ribavirin and mycophenolate mofetil, which deplete GTP through inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase in nucleated cells such as lymphocytes. We predict that 4 Py-riboside and 4 Py-nucleotides bind to this enzyme and alter its activity. The enzymes that regenerate NAD+ from nicotinamide riboside also convert the drugs tiazofurin and benzamide riboside into NAD+ analogues that inhibit IMP dehydrogenase more effectively than the related ribosides: we therefore propose that the accumulation of 4 PyTP in erythrocytes during renal failure is a marker for the accumulation of a related toxic NAD+ analogue that inhibits IMP dehydrogenase in other cells...|$|E

After 6 months the ACRpedi 30 / 50 / 70 index was 93 / 89 / 76 % and 63 / 57 / 47 % for adalimumab therapy <b>with</b> <b>immunosuppressants</b> and methotrexate, respectively. Adalimumab combined <b>with</b> <b>immunosuppressants</b> more quickly than methotrexate induced the stage of inactive disease/remission — after 5 (3; 8) and 12 (6; 18) months, respectively (p < 0. 001). After 6 and 12 months of supervision the stage of inactive disease/remission was reported in 43 and 47 % of patients treated with adalimumab combined with immunosuppressants, and in 9 and 38 % of patients receiving the methotrexate therapy. Adalimumab and methotrexate were well tolerated by 58 and 73 % of patients with JIA without systemic manifestations. The adverse events were reported in 42 and 27 % of patients, but became the reason for drug dechallenge only in 6 and 10 % of patients. Conclusion: Adalimumab combination therapy combined with immunosuppressants has faster and more evident anti-inflammatory effect than the <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> classical <b>immunosuppressant</b> methotrexate. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{patient with}} Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} is reported on who responded favourably {{to a short}} course <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> the novel <b>immunosuppressant</b> sodium fusidate (Fucidin), given at a daily dose of 1. 5 g for one week. Along with prompt and clear cut clinical improvement, <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> Fucidin {{was associated with a}} rapid decline in the blood concentrations of inflammatory cytokines presumably implicated in the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome such as interleukin- 2, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α. The ex vivo production of these cytokines was also markedly diminished compared with pretreatment values. Fucidin was well tolerated and no clinical or biochemical side effects were seen. ...|$|R
40|$|Vogt-Kaganayi-Harada (VKH) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autoimmune disease characterized by panuveitis, neuropathy and aseptic meningitis. Most patients require long-term <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> steroids and <b>immunosuppressants.</b> Patients may develop concurrent autoimmune diseases, especially endocrinopathies. Secondary malignancies are rare associations. We report a Chinese man with VKH syndrome presenting with multiple cranial nerve palsy and bilateral pan-uveitis, who developed disseminated high-grade B cell lymphoma after 3 -year <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> azathioprine. This is the first report of systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with VKH syndrome. The carcinogenic properties of azathioprine on an abnormally expanded but non-clonal lymphoid system {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
