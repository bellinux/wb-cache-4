Other parts of Latin America where the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> was discovered are the Dominican Republic in 1993, Bolivia, Cuba, Honduras, and Guatemala in 1995, El Salvador in 1996, Paraguay in 1999, Panama in 2002, and Uruguay and Nicaragua in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> was {{responsible}} for the Chikungunya epidemic on the French Island La Réunion in 2005–2006. By September 2006, an estimated 266,000 people were infected with the virus, and 248 fatalities occurred on the island. The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> was also the transmitter of the virus in the first and only outbreak of Chikungunya fever on the European continent. This outbreak occurred in the Italian province of Ravenna in the summer of 2007, and infected over 200 people. Evidently, mutated strains of the Chikungunya virus are being directly transmitted through Ae. albopictus particularly well and {{in such a way that}} another dispersal of the disease in regions with the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> is feared.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{apparently}} covers {{an extensive}} new niche. This means that no native, long-established species {{conflict with the}} dispersal of Ae. albopictus.|$|E
25|$|Though {{they do not}} {{commonly}} {{occur in}} the natural habitats of Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> predatory copepods from the Cyclopidae family seem to willingly feed on them given the opportunity. Relatives of different genera could therefore present a possibility in the control of <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Predators {{of adult}} Ae. albopictus in Malaysia include various spider species. Up to 90% of the {{gathered}} spiders from rubber plantations and a cemetery fed upon Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> Whether the spiders {{would have an}} effect on the mosquito population is still unclear. <b>Tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> were abundantly present despite the existence of the spiders.|$|R

25|$|The <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> is {{relevant}} to veterinary medicine. For example, tiger mosquitoes are transmitters of Dirofilaria immitis, a parasitic roundworm that causes heartworm in dogs and cats.|$|E
25|$|Fungi {{from the}} genus Coelomomyces (order Blastocladiales) develop inside the visceral cavity of {{mosquito}} larvae. The species Coelomomyces stegomyiae was first {{found on the}} Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b>|$|E
25|$|Toxorhynchites larvae, a {{mosquito}} genus {{that does not}} suck blood, feeds upon other mosquito larvae and are often found with <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> larvae. Flatworms and small swimming beetles are considered natural predators.|$|E

25|$|Primarily, other {{mosquito}} larvae, flatworms, swimming beetles, fungi, ciliates, paramecia, protozoans which act as parasites, predatory copepods, and spiders {{are natural}} {{enemies of the}} larval stage of Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b>|$|R
25|$|To date, few {{effective}} traps {{for adult}} Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> are available. Those traps that catch {{other species of}} mosquitoes do not catch <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for Ae. albopictus just like the monitoring tool, but it has {{the added benefit of}} contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control Aedes mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of Ae. albopictus. This device, {{with the help of a}} ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> was reduced in places where traps were installed.|$|R
25|$|Ae. albopictus can outcompete {{and even}} {{eradicate}} other species with similar breeding habitats {{from the very}} start of its dispersal to other regions and biotopes. In Kolkata, for example, it was observed in the 1960s that egg depositing containers were being settled by the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> in city districts where the malaria mosquito (genus Anopheles) and yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) had both been eliminated by the application of DDT. This may be because primarily the inner walls of the houses were treated with DDT to kill the mosquitoes resting there and fight the malaria mosquito. The yellow fever mosquito also lingers particularly in the inside of buildings and would have been also affected. The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> rests in the vicinity of human dwellings would therefore have an advantage over the other two species. In other cases, where the yellow fever mosquito was repressed by the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito,</b> for instance in Florida, this explanation does not fit. Other hypotheses include competition in the larval breeding waters, differences in metabolism and reproductive biology, or a major susceptibility to sporozoans (Apicomplexa).|$|E
25|$|The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{originally}} {{came from}} Southeast Asia. In 1966, parts of Asia {{and the island}} worlds of India and the Pacific Ocean were denoted as the area of circulation for the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b> Ae. albopictus as a native to tropical and subtropical regions with warm and humid climate, is active all year long; however, it has been adapting successfully to cooler, temperate regions, where they hibernate over winter. Eggs from strains in the temperate zones are more tolerant to the cold than ones from warmer regions. The species can even tolerate snow and temperatures under freezing. Adult tiger mosquitoes can survive throughout winter in suitable microhabitats.|$|E
25|$|Identifying tiger {{mosquitoes}} {{can seem}} easy with the above description, {{but many people}} mistakenly identify it. The best way to be sure is to compare the specimen with several approved pictures of the <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b>|$|E
40|$|La Crosse {{encephalitis}} is a {{viral disease}} {{that has emerged}} in new locations across the Appalachian region of the United States. Conventional wisdom suggests that ongoing emergence of La Crosse virus (LACV) could stem from the invasive Asian <b>tiger</b> (Aedes albopictus) <b>mosquito.</b> Efforts to prove this, however, are complicated by the numerous transmission routes and species interactions involved in LACV dynamics. To analyze LACV transmission by Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> we constructed epidemiologic models. These models accurately predict empirical infection rates. They do not, however, support the hypothesis that Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> are responsible for the recent emergence of LACV at new foci. Consequently, we conclude that other factors, including different invasive mosquitoes, changes in climate variables, or changes in wildlife densities, should be considered as alternative explanations for recent increases in La Crosse encephalitis. 27767009 PMC 508802...|$|R
25|$|The {{search for}} a host takes place in two phases. First, the {{mosquito}} exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until it perceives host stimulants, whereupon it secondly takes a targeted approach. For catching <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> with special traps, carbon dioxide and a combination of chemicals that naturally occur in human skin (fatty acids, ammonia, and lactic acid) are the most attractive.|$|R
25|$|In any case, an {{efficient}} surveillance {{is essential to}} monitor the presence of <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> {{and the effect of}} control programs. Ovitraps are normally used for the monitoring of Ae. albopictus. They are black water containers with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling. The results of ovitraps are often variable and depend on the availability of alternative egg-depositing waters. Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.|$|R
25|$|Since the mid 1960s, the <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{has spread}} to Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East. As of 2008 Ae. albopictus {{was one of the}} 100 world's worst {{invasive}} species according to the Global Invasive Species Database.|$|E
25|$|The other {{characteristics}} do not differentiate between sexes. A single silvery-white line of tight scales begins {{between the eyes}} and continues down the dorsal side of the thorax. This characteristic marking is the easiest and surest way to identify the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{mosquito}} {{species are}} crepuscular (dawn or dusk) feeders. During {{the heat of}} the day, most mosquitoes rest in a cool place and wait for the evenings, although they may still bite if disturbed. Some species, such as the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito,</b> are known to fly and feed during daytime.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Aedes albopictus), quickly and widely spread in Italy, {{represent}} ideal vectors for different Arboviruses, particularly Dengue virus (DenV) and Chikungunya virus (ChikV), who are causing millions of patients in the world per year. For ChikV, appeared {{for the first time in}} Italy in 2007, a Surveillance Plan was defined in the Marche Region, a neighbour county of the Italian outbreak site. As a support for this surveillance, we decided to create a new multiplex RT-PCR protocol to detect ChikV directly in <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> All the mosquitoes were collected with BG-Sentinel® traps (Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany). Total RNA extraction was carried with Helix RNA plus kit (Diatech srl, Jesi, Italy). For retro-transcription and amplification a Mastercycler® ep gradient S thermal cycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) was used. From the whole RNA extracted from captured mosquitoes, we developed a new end-point multiplex retro transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for both the detection and identification of Aedes spp. and ChikV. This RT-PCR protocol is able to detect ChikV directly from adult insects, during alerts or emergencies. The entomological trapping associated with bio-molecular methods represents an effective strategy to detect ChikV directly from vectors. Moreover, after a specific evaluation, this RT-PCR protocol could be applied also for human blood samples in regions with the certain presence of this virus...|$|R

25|$|The {{control of}} Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> begins with {{destroying}} {{the places where}} they lay their eggs, which are never far from where people are being bitten, since they are weak fliers, with only about a 180-m (650-ft) lifetime flying radius. Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or fine gravel to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.|$|R
25|$|The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> is similar, {{in terms}} of its close {{socialization}} with humans, to the common house mosquito (Culex pipiens). Among other differences in their biology, Culex pipiens prefers larger breeding waters and is more tolerant to cold. In this respect, no significant competition or suppression between the two species likely occurs.|$|E
25|$|Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta), {{from the}} {{mosquito}} (Culicidae) family, {{also known as}} (Asian) <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> or forest mosquito, is a mosquito native to the tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia; however, {{in the past few}} decades, this species has spread to many countries through the transport of goods and international travel. It is characterized by its black-and-white-striped legs, and small black-and-white-striped body.|$|E
25|$|The typical Ae. albopictus {{individual}} has a length around 2 to 10mm. As {{with other members}} of the mosquito family, the female is equipped with an elongated proboscis that she uses to collect blood to feed her eggs. The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> has a rapid bite that allows it to escape most attempts by people to swat it. By contrast, the male member of the species primarily feeds on nectar.|$|E
25|$|Sporozoans of {{the genus}} Ascogregarina (Lecudinidae) infect the larval stage of {{mosquitoes}}. The species Ascogregarina taiwanensis was found in Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> When the adult mosquitoes emerge from their pupal case, they leave the infectious intermediary stage of parasites {{in the water and}} close off the infection cycle. Infected adults are generally smaller than non-infected adults and have an insignificantly higher mortality rate; therefore, food supply and larval density apparently play a role. In competitive situations, an infection with sporozoans can also reduce the biological fitness of other uninfected mosquitoes. However, the use of the parasites as an effective biological remedy to control mosquito populations is implausible because the host must reach the adult stage for the transmission of the parasites.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the great}} hardships {{they had to}} endure the Japanese boys counted the Manchurian <b>tiger</b> <b>{{mosquitoes}}</b> and the vermin. Out of their tents the mosquitoes devoured them and in the tents even the proverbial cleanliness of the Japs did not suffice to keep them free from vermin.

Behind them stand two others waiting their turn. The tents are officers' tents. Just behind the barber's victim lies a heap of barbed wire used by the Russians for entanglements and cut down by the Japanese advance guards, telegraph wire and poles and other rubbish, once erected by the Russians at great cost of time and labor.

Based on bioactivity-guided fractionation, 11, 13 -dihydroisoalantolactone (1), macrophyllilactone E (2), 5 α-epoxyalantolactone (3), and epoxyisoalantolactone (4) were isolated and identified as the active constituents. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited strong larvicidal activity against the early fourth-instar larvae of A. albopictus with LC 50 values of 21. 86 [*]μg/mL and 18. 65 [*]μg/mL, respectively, while the ethanol extract had a LC 50 value of 25. 23 [*]μg/mL.

25|$|In Asia, the Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> can {{be mistaken}} for {{other members of the}} {{subgenus}} Stegomyia, particularly the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern. It can be hard to distinguish Ae. albopictus from the closely related Aedes scutellaris (India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines), Aedes pseudoalbopictus (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) and Aedes seatoi (Thailand).|$|E
25|$|The Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{is about}} 2 to 10mm length with a {{striking}} {{white and black}} pattern. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on {{the density of the}} larval population and food supply within the breeding water. Since these circumstances are seldom optimal, the average body size of adult mosquitoes is considerably smaller than 10mm. For example, the average length of the abdomen was calculated to be 2.63mm, the wings 2.7mm, and the proboscis 1.88mm.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the {{mosquito}} Culiseta annulata, {{which is very}} common, but does not occur in high densities, can be mistaken for an Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> because of its black-and-white-ringed legs. However, this species is missing the distinctive white line that runs {{from the middle of}} its head and down the thorax. It is also considerably larger than Ae. albopictus, is not black and white, but rather beige and grey striped, and has wings with noticeable veins and four dark, indistinct spots.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne, arthrogenic Alphavirus {{that causes}} large {{epidemics}} in Africa, South-East Asia and India. Recently, CHIKV has been transmitted to humans in Southern Europe by invading and now established Asian <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> To study {{the processing of}} envelope proteins E 1 and E 2 {{and to develop a}} CHIKV subunit vaccine, C-terminally his-tagged E 1 and E 2 envelope glycoproteins were produced at high levels in insect cells with baculovirus vectors using their native signal peptides located in CHIKV 6 K and E 3, respectively. Results Expression in the presence of either tunicamycin or furin inhibitor showed that a substantial portion of recombinant intracellular E 1 and precursor E 3 E 2 was glycosylated, but that a smaller fraction of E 3 E 2 was processed by furin into mature E 3 and E 2. Deletion of the C-terminal transmembrane domains of E 1 and E 2 enabled secretion of furin-cleaved, fully processed E 1 and E 2 subunits, which could then be efficiently purified from cell culture fluid via metal affinity chromatography. Confocal laser scanning microscopy on living baculovirus-infected Sf 21 cells revealed that full-length E 1 and E 2 translocated to the plasma membrane, suggesting similar posttranslational processing of E 1 and E 2, as in a natural CHIKV infection. Baculovirus-directed expression of E 1 displayed fusogenic activity as concluded from syncytia formation. CHIKV-E 2 was able to induce neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Conclusions Chikungunya virus glycoproteins could be functionally expressed at high levels in insect cells and are properly glycosylated and cleaved by furin. The ability of purified, secreted CHIKV-E 2 to induce neutralizing antibodies in rabbits underscores the potential use of E 2 in a subunit vaccine to prevent CHIKV infections. </p...|$|R
