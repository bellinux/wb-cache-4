5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free trade policies, inflation and <b>the</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loans Crisis contributed to the recession that impacted cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several production centers.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loan crisis.

The collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loans and the subsequent government bailout only added to the difficult financial environment that Bush confronted during his presidency.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment rates for 20 African countries using {{a long period of}} data. A high correlation between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment is often taken as evidence of capital immobility. We use the new Ng–Perron unit root tests to examine <b>the</b> stationarity of <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment rates. Both Johansen cointegration tests and fractional cointegration tests are used. The results are mixed. The Johansen cointegration tests show that <b>the</b> <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment rates are cointegrated only for Rwanda and South Africa. This implies that for the other 18 countries, there is evidence of capital mobility. The fractional cointegration test results are different. The two rates are found to be fractionally cointegrated for the following 12 countries: Algeria, Burundi, Egypt, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tunisia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. For Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Lesotho and Sierra Leone there is some evidence of capital mobility while the results for Ethiopia, Malawi, Mauritius and Nigeria are mixed. 10 page(s...|$|R

25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits will typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} interest income from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loan crisis was in part caused by this problem, that <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|E
