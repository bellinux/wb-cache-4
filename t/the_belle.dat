5|$|While La Salle was gone, six {{of those}} who had {{remained}} on <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> was always drunk. Many of the sailors {{did not know how to}} sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue {{sold the}} stadium in 1982, but {{speedway}} continued there until 1987; the final event was a stock car race, held on 14 November 1987, {{shortly before the}} stadium was demolished after having been sold to the British Car Auction Group. <b>The</b> <b>Belle</b> Vue Aces returned to their first home, the greyhound stadium, where they had begun in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Leopold II {{was sworn}} in as king of the Belgians in 1865. His reign coincided with <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Époque and rapid {{economic}} expansion from the 1880s.

50|$|The Southern ran three Pullman trains with <b>the</b> suffix <b>Belle.</b> <b>The</b> {{others were}} <b>the</b> Brighton <b>Belle</b> (originally <b>the</b> Southern <b>Belle)</b> and <b>the</b> Bournemouth <b>Belle.</b> British Railways {{introduced}} <b>the</b> Thanet <b>Belle</b> (later renamed <b>the</b> Kentish <b>Belle)</b> in 1948.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Belles</b> {{were founded}} {{in the fall of}} 1977 by Katherine Mitchell, a student at the University of Virginia. A woman who {{continues}} to love music, Katherine noticed then that there was no outlet for female a cappella at the university. The Virginia Gentlemen, the university's oldest all-male a cappella group had been established since 1953, so Katherine formed <b>The</b> Virginia <b>Belles</b> as <b>the</b> female counterpart to the Virginia Gentlemen. Initially <b>the</b> <b>Belles</b> were a select part of the Virginia Women's Chorus. The most talented members of the Women's Chorus were asked to audition for <b>the</b> <b>Belles,</b> singing both madrigal and popular music. Today, <b>the</b> <b>Belles</b> hold auditions every semester for every female student at the university to attend.|$|R
50|$|Philadelphia's first women's tackle {{football}} team {{was founded in}} 2001 as <b>the</b> Philadelphia Liberty <b>Belles.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Belles</b> won <b>the</b> inaugural NWFL Championship that year.

5|$|The {{music of}} Francesco Tosti was popular {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, and is remembered for his light, {{expressive}} songs. His style became very popular during <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Époque and is often known as salon music.

Both X-Factor and Hell's Belles fled, but met up again, this time X-Factor overpowering <b>the</b> <b>Belles</b> and taking them into custody. After [...] "Decimation" [...] occurred, Flambé, Tremolo, and Vague were all depowered. Briquette is the only member of <b>the</b> Hell's <b>Belles</b> that possibly retains her mutant powers.|$|R
5|$|After {{a fire at}} Manchester City's Hyde Road {{ground in}} 1920, the club {{considered}} a move to <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At the behest of Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, Manchester Central, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in September 1928. The club attempted unsuccessfully to join The Football League in 1930 and in 1931; with momentum lost, the club faded, and folded in 1934.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Époque.|$|E
5|$|Datta (2005) shows that, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne (1893), Maurice Barrès's Les Déracinés (1897), Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon (1900), and André de Lorde and Gyp's Napoléonette (1913)—Datta examines how writers and critics of <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Belles</b> are a dance/drill {{team that}} {{originated}} {{when the school}} was inaugurated in 1957. The team has undergone many changes since then, but still holds on to many traditions. The military-style uniform of kelly green satin has remained the same through the years with only slight changes and additions to it, such as {{the addition of a}} belt and a smaller flower on the glittery head band. <b>The</b> <b>Belles</b> also perform <b>the</b> traditional BA Kick routine with ten head-high kicks at every performance.

5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} improbability of landfall {{in the days}} preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Glade town council {{and the founder of}} the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees. About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene lamps, and boards were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.|$|E
5|$|The Kirkmanshulme Lane {{stadium in}} Belle Vue {{is the home}} to top-flight {{speedway}} team <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Vue Aces and regular greyhound racing.

5|$|On November8, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana president, Charlotte Randolph, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the United States Gulf Coast. Although no evacuations were issued, all schools and government offices were closed through November10. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in Plaquemines Parish along coastal areas. <b>The</b> <b>Belle</b> Chasse Auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm. Grand Isle mayor David Carmadelle issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island. Nearly 1,400 families still living in temporary FEMA homes in Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, were urged to stay at home.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of April 6, 2002, a grease fire {{broke out in the}} Hardee's {{restaurant}} at <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Plaine service plaza. Exacerbated by heavy winds, the fire destroyed the building, which also contained a travel information center. Four fire departments responded to the scene. The assistant fire chief and fire chief of the Wellington Fire Department gave conflicting statements on whether the unavailability of the Wellington water tower, which had been emptied while it was being repainted, had hampered efforts to extinguish the blaze. The fire burned for three hours, with hot spots still smoldering the following day. No injuries were reported. The fire caused $2 million in damages. The service plaza was rebuilt, with a reopening celebration occurring on July 24, 2003.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{activities}} that became synonymous with Belle Vue was speedway (known {{at the time as}} dirt track racing), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built greyhound racing arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a speedway stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built speedway stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Vue Aces, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (Belle Vue Rangers), baseball, stock car racing and tennis. The stadium had covered accommodation for 40,000spectators. As the speedway bikes ran on wood alcohol (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, Paris has been {{famous for its}} {{restaurants}} and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Epoque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner, built during <b>the</b> <b>Belle</b> Époque {{to resemble a}} stylish Parisian block of flats, over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli. Its architects were Charles Mewès, who had previously designed Ritz's Hôtel Ritz Paris, and Arthur Davis, with engineering collaboration by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander. It {{was one of the}} earliest substantial steel frame structures in London, the Savoy Hotel extension of 1903-04 being the first in the capital. Many of the materials used {{in the construction of the}} hotel were US-made. The initial fees for suites ranged from 1 1/2 guineas to 3 1/2 guineas.|$|E
