[...] Coulter writes, [...] "He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad {{or trying to}} guess {{whatever it was that}} white folks were thinking about you.'

2500|$|The label, wanting Houston {{to have a}} solid urban fanbase first, {{released}} [...] "You Give Good Love" [...] as {{the first}} single. The soulful ballad would top the R chart and surprise the label by crossing over and reaching number three on the pop chart while the singer was playing at nightclubs in the United States.
