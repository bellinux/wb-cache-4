5|$|From December 1945 to May 1946 No.75 Squadron was {{maintained}} as a cadre located at Deniliquin and manned by one officer and three airmen without any aircraft. In May 1946 the squadron moved to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney, {{but was not}} issued with any aircraft or further personnel until it moved to RAAF Base Williamtown in September that year and was equipped with P-51Mustang fighters. No.75 Squadron used these aircraft for routine <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises</b> until it was disbanded on 25March 1948.|$|E
5|$|No.81 Wing {{transferred}} to Iwakuni in April 1948, {{the same month}} that the Federal government determined to reduce Australia's contribution to BCOF.

No.82 Squadron conducted further <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises</b> until September, and was disbanded at Iwakuni on 29October 1948.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} in the Army's {{organization}} in the Pacific occurred on 15 May 1972, {{in conjunction with the}} return of Okinawa to Japanese control after twenty-seven years of administration by the United States. Under the complex reorganization that accompanied reversion, Headquarters, IX U.S. Army Corps, was transferred from Okinawa and collocated with Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan, to form Headquarters, U.S. Army, Japan/IX Corps, at Camp Zama, Japan. There, its responsibilities included administrative oversight of US forces as well as conducting <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises</b> with US and other units in the region.

5|$|Barrowclough's {{opportunity}} {{for a return to}} duty overseas came following the death of Mead in an aircraft crash in July 1942. At the time of Mead's death, the Pacific Section was being recalled to New Zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in the South Pacific. In August, Barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as the 3rd New Zealand Division. He immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty, replacing them with personnel who had experience with the 2NZEF in Greece, Crete or North Africa. He also implemented training programs for his new command; most of its personnel had been engaged in the construction of fortifications while in Fiji, which had left little {{opportunity for}} intensive tactical <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commissioned {{too late}} to see any combat in World War II, Boxer {{spent much of her}} career in the Pacific Ocean seeing 10 tours in the western Pacific. Her initial duties {{involved}} mostly <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises,</b> including launching the first carrier-based jet aircraft, but demobilization prevented much activity in the late 1940s. At the outbreak of the Korean War, she was used as an aircraft transport before arriving off Korean waters as the third U.S. carrier to join the force. She supported the Inchon landings and subsequent invasion of North Korea, and was among the ships that provided support during the Chinese counteroffensive against an under-prepared and spread out United Nations (UN) force. She saw three subsequent combat tours in Korea conducting close air support and strategic bombing in support of UN ground troops fighting along the 38th parallel, as the battles lines had largely solidified by this time. She was awarded eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Believing Mercer to {{have been}} captured, General Currie assumed command of the battle and {{with the use of}} {{saturation}} bombardment was able to retake the lost trenches and drive the Germans back to Mount Sorrel despite heavy casualties. On the 21 June a Canadian burial party found 30 bodies in a sector of trench, amongst them General Mercer's remains, only recognisable by his uniform decoration. Mercer was buried in a military grave at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery, later surmounted with a Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Mercer's funeral was attended by many men of his Division and from his old regiments as well as numerous Canadian and British officers who had worked alongside him. Mercer was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his courage under fire, the third time he had been so mentioned, and his division was taken over by Major-General Louis Lipsett who was himself killed in action two years later. Mercer is remembered as an efficient and capable organiser who never got the opportunity to demonstrate the tactical nous he had shown in <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises.</b> He also remains the highest ranking Canadian officer to ever be killed in combat and reportedly by friendly fire.|$|E

On 17 May, Manoora operated as part of the Battle of Wakde, followed by the landings at Morotai on 15 September, and Leyte during October. At the start of 1945, the ship participated in operations at Lingayen Gulf, followed by the Borneo campaign, with landings at Tarakan on 1 May, Brunei Bay during 9 and 10 June, then Balikpapan on 1 July. After this, Manoora sailed to Australia, and was in Sydney when World War II ended.|$|E
25|$|No. 24 Squadron was re-formed at Mallala, South Australia as a Citizens Air Force (reserve) fighter {{squadron}} on 30 April 1951. The squadron was allocated {{a fighter}} role, and {{was equipped with}} P-51 Mustang fighters and Wirraway training aircraft, being the only CAF squadron to operate Mustangs for the entire post-war period with all others operating jet aircraft. The squadron later received a number of Tiger Moths and Winjeels and undertook a range of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises,</b> often on weekends, as well as training cadet pilots. During this period the squadron lost two pilots killed in separate incidents in 1957. On 1 March 1960 the squadron became an RAAF (Auxiliary) unit, with the squadron moving to a temporary base in North Adelaide. Meanwhile, in May two Vampire jet aircraft became available to the unit.|$|E

500|$|By 1930, {{the effects}} of the Great Depression had reduced the {{opportunities}} for Duntroon graduates. Only four of Wilton's classmates joined the Australian Military Forces, while four transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and four to the British Army. Wilton was among the last-mentioned, taking a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, with seniority from 22November 1930. Seeking active duty, he requested a posting to India, and sailed with the 6th Field Brigade to Bombay in November 1931. He spent the next three years based at Fyzabad, near the Nepalese border. Promoted to lieutenant in November 1933, he undertook <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises</b> with his battery, and learned to speak Urdu, but saw no action. In February 1935 he was posted to Burma, joining the 10th (Abbottabad) Battery of the Indian Mountain Artillery at Maymyo, near Mandalay. According to biographer David Horner, Wilton's [...] "first taste of excitement" [...] was in April 1935, when he joined the hunt for a rogue tiger and shot the animal as it attacked and mauled one of his companions. [...] In November he saw operational service with his unit in skirmishes with local tribesmen in the Wa State of northern Burma, on the Chinese border.|$|E
500|$|Once activated, the {{division}} {{remained in the}} United States for <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercises.</b> As {{the division}}, like all airborne units, {{was intended to be}} an elite formation, the training regime was extremely arduous. There were [...] and [...] towers built from which prospective airborne troops would jump off of to simulate landing by parachute, lengthy forced marches and practice jumps from transport aircraft; to pause in the doorway of an aircraft during a practice jump resulted in an automatic failure for the candidate. The resultant failure rate was accordingly high, but there was never a shortage of candidates, especially for the American divisions, as the rate of pay was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman. As the division trained, a debate developed in the U.S. Army over whether the best use of airborne forces was en masse or as small compact units. On 9 July 1943, the first large-scale Allied airborne operation–the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky)–was carried out by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the British 1st Airborne Division. The Commanding General (CG) of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, Major General Joseph May Swing, had been temporarily assigned to act as airborne advisor to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, for the invasion of Sicily, and had observed the airborne assault, which went badly. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division had been deployed by both parachute and glider and had suffered high casualties, leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives.|$|E
