50|$|The ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an Alt-Az, 3.58-metre Richey-Chretien {{telescope}} which {{pioneered the}} use of active optics. The telescope and its enclosure had a revolutionary design for optimal image quality. NTT saw first light in March 1989. The <b>telescope</b> <b>chamber</b> is ventilated by a system of flaps which optimize the air flow across the NTT minimizing the dome and mirror seeing. To prevent heat input to the building, all motors in the telescope are water cooled and all the electronics boxes are insulated and cooled. The primary mirror of the NTT is actively controlled to preserve its figure at all telescope positions. The secondary mirror position is also actively controlled in three directions. The optimized airflow, the thermal controls, and the active optics give the excellent image quality of the NTT. Note that the NTT has active instead of adaptive optics: it corrects the defects and deformation of the telescope and mirror, but does not correct the turbulence; it ensures that the optics is always in perfect shape. Together with the thermal control, it allows the NTT to reach the ambient seeing, {{but it does not}} improve it.|$|R

50|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{detecting}} individual gamma rays ranging from 30 MeV to 30 GeV, EGRET was equipped with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome, spark chamber, and calorimeter. Starting from {{the outside of the}} telescope, scientists covered EGRET with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome. The dome acted as a shield, blocking any unwanted energy waves from entering the telescope and skewing the data. To actually create recordable, usable data, scientists used a process called electron-positron pair production, which is creating an electron and positron simultaneously near a nucleus or subatomic particle. In order to induce this process, scientists assembled a multilevel thin-plate spark <b>chamber</b> within the <b>telescope.</b> A spark <b>chamber</b> is basically a chamber with many plates of metal and gases such as helium or neon.

On the other hand, another anisotropy of helioboundary origin from the helionose direction (α ≃ 18 hr), being accompanied by the heliotail-in anisotropy, was found through the observations with neutron monitors in the low energy region (∼ 20 GeV) in 2005. These observations, however, lack information in the mid-energy region (20 ∼ 200 GeV).

Furthermore, there were no X-Ray or gamma observations and the information on the associated flare is limited. Cosmic ray data was obtained exclusively by ground level detectors of small size and in some cases of a non-standard design. In the present work all available data from neutron monitors operating in 1956 were analyzed, in order to develop a model of the solar cosmic ray behavior during the event. The time-dependent characteristics of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, cosmic ray anisotropy, and differential and integral fluxes have been evaluated utilizing different isotropic and anisotropic models. It is shown that the most outstanding features of this proton enhancement were a narrow and extremely intense beam of ultra-relativistic particles arriving at Earth just after the onset and the unusually high maximum solar particle energy. However, the contribution of this beam to the overall solar particle density and fluency was not significant because of its very short duration and small width. Our estimate of the integral flux for particles with energies over 100 MeV places this event above all subsequent.

Symmetric and asymmetric entrance channels, leading to similar compound nuclei, have been compared {{in order to determine}} the characteristics of the reaction mechanism. The symmetric system 40 Ca + 40 Ca has been studied at laboratory energies of 197. 3 and 230. 5 MeV. The fissionlike products were detected by a series of six time of flight telescopes, placed at angles between 10 ° and 52. 4 ° to the beam, and a Bragg curve spectrometer-multiwire proportional <b>chamber</b> <b>telescope,</b> situated at 30 °. Data were collected in both singles and coincidence modes. To complement this measurement, fully damped yields from 28 Si + 50, 52, 54 Cr at 130 MeV and from 28 Si + 50 Cr at 150 MeV were measured using an array of four avalanche counter-silicon surface barrier detector telescopes spanning the angular range between 20 ° and 50 °. The avalanche counters used in this experiment are of a new design which was developed in Oxford. We present the features of this design and discuss the detectors' operational characteristics. Several possible interpretations of the data are considered. It is shown that diffusion models of deep-inelastic scattering tend to underpredict the measured fully relaxed cross sections. Rotating finite range model calculations of fission barriers point to the possibility of fast-fission in this mass region; a process hitherto associated with much heavier systems. Furthermore, such models also predict that these systems may fission asymmetrically. The more commonly employed rotating liquid drop model of the nucleus is unable to predict either of these effects. The data are compared with those reported in the literature for other systems in this mass region. It is argued that all these results are consistent with fast-fission and asymmetric fission, thus obviating the need for the previously proposed interpretation in terms of intermediate mechanisms. </p...|$|R
