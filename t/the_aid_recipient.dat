40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> imperfectly; the donor agency and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are subject to inefficiency; <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> experiences corruption; and adjustment of aid recipient performance is costly. Incentives between the aid donor and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for the poorest aid recipients and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> The importance of aid agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in aid recipients. Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in aid recipients will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so.

The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of aid, in the sense that more aid comes to be allocated to aid recipients with good governance.

40|$|The author studies {{foreign aid}} policy within a principal-agent framework. He shows {{that one reason}} for foreign aid's poor overall record may be a moral hazard problem that shapes <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> s {{incentive}} to undertake structural reform. The model's basic prediction is a two-way relationship: Disbursements of foreign aid are guided (in part) by {{the needs of the}} poor. Anticipating this, recipients have little incentive to improve the welfare of the poor. Preliminary econometric work shows that the data support this hypothesis. In principle, conditionality could partly solve this problem, but only if the donor can make a binding commitment to increase disbursements in good relative to bad states. Without such a commitment technology, aid disbursements remain guided by the needs of the poor and recipient countries maintain a low effort to reduce poverty. Contrary to the conventional wisdom found in the aid literature, the author shows that the welfare of all parties might be improved by using tied project aid or by delegating part of the aid budget to an (international) agency with less aversion to poverty.

Tatemae {{refers to the}} 'façade' or 'appearances' while honne signifies the 'real intention'. The Japanese {{government}} has pledged to use foreign aid to promote economic development and political stability in developing countries. On the other hand, Japan's official development assistance (ODA) program has been repeatedly criticised for being employed {{as a tool to}} promote Japan's own commercial interests. In this context, altruism could be a superficial principle of Japanese foreign aid policy which forms the 'tatemae' dimension while selfishness could represent a true hidden motive for the aid giving and form the 'honne' dimension. The present paper uses panel data analysis to examine which element – honne or tatemae – has influenced the decision-making process of allocation of Japan's ODA to Southeast Asia. The findings indicate that the volumes of Japan's exports to and income levels in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> countries had a significant influence on foreign aid distribution. The Japanese government tended to allocate bigger amounts of money to Japan's major trade partners in ASEAN.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Purpose This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence that awards of financial aid have on the educational decisions and academic achievement of applicants for freshman year financial aid at Oregon State University. The study was primarily concerned with the effectiveness of financial aid in assisting students to enroll and become established in college. Thus, students were followed only {{to the point where they}} returned or failed to return for the sophomore year. Design The design of the study was twofold. First, the 2801 applicants for freshman year financial aid at OSU for the 1969 - 1970 and 1970 - 1971 academic years were classified as Aid Recipients (N= 1354) and Non-Recipients (N= 1447), and were compared with a systematic sample of Non-Applicants (N= 742) in terms of 1) matriculation rates, 2) withdrawal rates, 3) suspension rates, 4) freshman year GPA, 5) number of credit hours completed, and 6) return rates for the sophomore year. For the second part of the study, <b>the</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipient</b> group was sub-grouped according to the type and amount of aid awarded and these sub-groups were compared in terms of the six variables above. Data for each of the years under study were analyzed separately to permit comparisons between years. By controlling the variables of sex, age and scholastic aptitude and achievement, conclusions regarding the effects of aid awards were drawn. Scholastic aptitude and achievement were controlled in the study by using multiple regression equations which were generated to predict freshman year GPA's for each student. The resulting predicted GPA was used as a covariate in testing the hypotheses concerned with academic achievement. Several statistical models were employed to test the hypotheses regarding differences among the groups studied. Aid Recipients, Non-Recipients and Non-Applicants were compared using chi-square analysis and analysis of variance. Multi-variate discriminant analysis and least-squares analysis of covariance were conducted to compare Aid Recipients who were classified by the type and amount of aid awarded. Conclusions When the students who applied for financial aid were grouped into the categories of Aid Recipients and Non-Recipients, and compared to a sample of Non-Applicants, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Awards of aid are effective in increasing the matriculation rates of applicants for freshman year financial aid at Oregon State University. 2. Aid Applicants have higher predicted GPA's and have higher levels of academic achievement at OSU during the freshman year than do Non-Applicants. 3. Awards of aid do not affect the withdrawal rates, suspension rates, freshman year GPA, number of credit hours completed, or return rates for the sophomore year of applicants for freshman year financial aid. When the students in <b>the</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipient</b> category were subgrouped according to the type and amount of aid awarded, and these sub-groups were compared, the following conclusions were drawn: 4.

40|$|International {{development}} assistance from richer to poorer (“developing”) economies accounts for major flows of capital, human resources and technical assistance. While the net direction of these flows remains {{a topic of}} hot debate, {{there have been several}} barriers identified to the efficient use of aid within developing countries, many of which revolve around difficulties with achieving “good governance ” in recipient countries (World Bank, 2004). Donor agencies have consequently become increasingly interested in facilitating good governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> organisations they work with. However, Feachem (2004) in his capacity as Director of the Global Fund, has noted that it is now becoming increasingly obvious that good governance is also an issue on the “supply side”: competing interests and agencies within the United Nations and multilateral aid system; between different donor governments; and between a plethora of non-governmental organisations, is producing inefficiencies and a lack of coordinated activity. Without making organisational learning a feature of the aid system, the notion of capacity development is, we believe, reminiscent of Sisyphus, destined to battle the same obstacles time and again. Capacity development is by definition contingent on organisational learning. While we recognise that there may be no singular “type ” of learning that can claim precedence over others, we wish to focus in some detail on the learning that is required to make projects work through people. Beyond the economic, technical and political resources needed to get things done, it is people who are the intended beneficiaries, and it is people whose interaction with the systems of aid we have, and again the people representing them, that need to be understood. At the foundation of these Human dynamics is motivation, and in particular motives toward social equity.

A few of these transactions have been declared by Swedish administrative courts to constitute illegal below market value transfers of public resources. The essay seeks {{to determine whether the}} Swedish national provisions that govern legal claims based on the directly effective Art. 88 (3) of the EC Treaty, are compatible with the principle of effectiveness, i. e. to what extent these provisions (do not) render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Art. 88 (3) EC. The author investigates the conformity of national rules with the principle of effectiveness in a situation where a) a private party seeks to enforce recovery of unlawfully adopted state aid and b) the European Commission has yet to take any action with respect to the aid measure. By examining the ECJ case-law on the principle of effectiveness vis-à-vis the case-law on Art. 88 (3) EC, the author concludes, inter alia, that several Swedish procedural provisions are deemed to be found incompatible with the principle of effectiveness. Furthermore, the author ends up concluding that in respect of a competitor’s right to enforce aid recovery, the current case-law of the ECJ leaves certain key questions unanswered, most notably whether or not national law must provide a competitor the possibility to bring a recovery action directly against <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient...</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE - The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate how lessons learned from a case study of a construction project undertaken in the Pacific Islands relates to the interaction between social capital and knowledge transfer. The paper is reflective in nature focusing upon the experiences of one of the authors, being a Pacific Islander and {{trying to make sense of}} the role of social capital and the way that it impacts upon knowledge transfer. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - Three theoretical frameworks are drawn upon in a pilot test of tools used to better understand and measure knowledge transfer including barriers to knowledge transfer to help explain the difficulty of knowledge transfer in a given context and the development of social capital for a foreign aid project. These tools allowed us to visualise project stakeholder outcomes for knowledge transfer and building social capital that were articulated by <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> as being highly important. This was a pilot study and results reported upon in this paper were fed back to stakeholder representatives concerned for their comment and validation. Project documentation data, unstructured ad hoc interviews, together with personal reflection-in-practice, were gathered and used for the study. FINDINGS - The approach was found to be very useful in helping stakeholders better visualise and measure this project outcome, whereas experience from previous similar projects indicated that it was very difficult for stakeholders to find a tangible way of measuring this important element of success or failure.

The economic justification for state aid can address several issues present in the competition for capital and the competition for transfers from the state. First, there are principal-agent problems involved at several stages. Self-interested politicians might enter state aid deals that are the result of extensive rent-seeking activities of organized interest groups. Thus the institutional design of political systems will have an effect on the propensity of a jurisdiction to award state aid. Secondly, fierce competition for firm locations can lead to over-spending. This effect is stronger if the politicians do not take into account the entirety of the costs created by their participation in the firm location race. Thirdly, state aid deals can be incomplete and not in the interest of the citizens. This applies if there are no sanctions if firms do not meet their obligations from receiving aid, such as creating a certain number of jobs or not relocating again for a certain amount of time. The separation of ownership and control in modern corporations leads to principal-agent problems on the side of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> as well. Managers might receive personal benefits from subsidies, the use of which is sometimes less monitored than private finance. This can eventually be to the detriment of the shareholders. Overall, it can be concluded that state aid control should also serve the purpose of regulating the contracting between governments and firms. An extended mandate for supervision by the European Commission could include requirements to disincentive the misuse of state aid. The Commission should also focus on the corporate governance regime in place in the jurisdiction that awards the aid as well as in the recipient firm...|$|E
40|$|Development aid {{involves}} a complex network of numerous and extremely heterogeneous actors. Nevertheless, all actors seem {{to speak the}} same ‘development jargon’ and to display a congruence that extends from the donor over the professional consultant to the village chief. And although the ideas about what counts as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ aid have constantly changed over time —with new paradigms and policies sprouting every few years— the apparent congruence between actors more or less remains unchanged. How can this be explained? Is it a strategy of all actors {{to get into the}} pocket of the donor, or are the social dynamics in development aid more complex? When a new development paradigm appears, where does it come from and how does it gain support? Is this support really homogeneous? To answer the questions, a multi-sited ethnography was conducted in the sector of water-related development aid, with a focus on 3 paradigms that are currently hegemonic in this sector: Integrated Water Resources Management, Capacity Building, and Adaptation to Climate Change. The sites of inquiry were: the headquarters of a multilateral organization, the headquarters of a development NGO, and the Inner Niger Delta in Mali. The research shows that paradigm shifts do not happen overnight but that new paradigms have long lines of descent. Moreover, they require a lot of work from actors in order to become hegemonic; the actors need to create a tight network of support. Each actor, however, interprets the paradigms in a slightly different way, depending on the position in the network. They implant their own interests in their interpretation of the paradigm (the actors ‘translate’ their interests), regardless of whether they constitute the donor, a mediator, or <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> These translations are necessary to cement and reproduce the network...|$|E
