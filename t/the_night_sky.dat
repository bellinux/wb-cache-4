5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The astrological symbol Pisces {{is based}} on a {{constellation}} of the same name, {{but there is also a}} second fish constellation in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> Piscis Austrinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> Sirius is {{recorded in the}} earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days before returning to <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it {{just prior to the}} summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E

5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close {{to each other in the}} sky and served as boreal pole stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> performing a looping motion.|$|E

5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{projector}} was a -long dumbbell-shaped object, with -diameter spheres attached at {{each end}} representing <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> for {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors, including those dedicated to the planets, the Sun, and specific stars.|$|E
5|$|The star's {{magnitude}} as observed from Earth is 9; this signifies {{that the}} body is not visible with the naked eye, but can be seen with a telescope.
