25|$|The Ford scored well in test {{drives and}} the media was pleased {{with some of the}} new {{features}} available in the 2010 Ford Taurus. Some of these features include all wheel drive, cross <b>traffic</b> <b>alert,</b> collision warning, blind spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control. However, others criticized the lack of interior room and reduced sight lines despite its full-sized exterior, and Edmunds noted that the eighth-generation Honda Accord (which competes in the mid-size category) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design and offered almost as much interior space as the Taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions.|$|E

40|$|Mid-air {{collisions}} are {{a concern}} for general aviation. Current <b>traffic</b> <b>alerting</b> systems have limited usability in the airport environment where a majority of mid-air collisions occur. A Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerting Application (TSAA) has been developed which uses Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B), a Global Positioning System (GPS) based surveillance system, to provide reliable alerts in a condensed environment. TSAA {{was designed to be}} compatible with general aviation operations. It was specifically designed to enhance traffic situation awareness and provide <b>traffic</b> <b>alerting.</b> The system does not include guidance or resolution advisories. In addition, the design was consistent with established standards, previous <b>traffic</b> <b>alerting</b> system precedents, as well as air traffic control precedent. Taking into account the potential financial burden associated with installation of a multi-function display (MFD), an audio based TSAA system was also designed to account for constrained cockpit space and the added cost of a MFD. This project was funded by the U. S. Department of Transportation - Federal Aviation Administration through the University of Maryland (NEXTOR II) Contract #Z 988401...|$|R

40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) will be {{the basis}} of the future {{surveillance}} system in the US as well as many other countries. One way to create incentives for users to equip with the required ADS-B avionics is to create and implement ADS-B applications that are of high value to the operators. One such application is the airborne <b>traffic</b> <b>alerting</b> application named <b>Traffic</b> Situation Awareness with Alerting (TSAA) 6. As a first step in the development of this application, an analysis of ten years of NTSB mid-air collision reports was conducted to identify areas of high mid-air collision risk. Similarly, ten years worth of ASRS and NMACS near mid-air collision reports were also analyzed. The airport environment is where most mid-air collisions occurred (59 % of NTSB reports) and most near mid-air collisions were reported (64 % of ASRS reports and 47 % of NMACS reports). As such, most benefit from <b>traffic</b> <b>alerting</b> can be gained from alerts in the airport environment. Encounters between Part 121 aircraft and General Aviation were most often reported between a cruising General Aviation aircraft and a Part 121 aircraft transitioning through that same altitude. GA/Part 121 encounters make up 14 % NMACS as well as ASRS reports...|$|R
