5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added {{to the top of a}} pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Frozen premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, on November 19, 2013, {{and went}} into general {{theatrical}} release on November 27. It was met with strongly positive reviews from critics and audiences; some film critics consider Frozen {{to be the best}} Disney animated feature film since the studio's renaissance era. The film also achieved significant commercial success, earning nearly $1.3 billion in worldwide box office revenue, $400 million of <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Canada and $247 million in Japan. It ranks as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, the third-highest-grossing original film of all time, the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2013, and the third-highest-grossing film in Japan. It was also the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earnings, until surpassed by Warner Bros.' Wonder Woman. With over 18 million home media sales in 2014, it became the best-selling film {{of the year in the}} United States. By January 2015, Frozen had become the all-time best-selling Blu-ray Disc in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000.

The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
