40|$|Rats, {{mice and}} guinea-pigs were {{administered}} p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (clofibric acid) or 2, 2 '-(decamethylenedithio) diethanol (<b>tiadenol).</b> The treatments of {{rats and mice}} with either clofibric acid or <b>tiadenol</b> increased markedly the activities of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, palmitoyl-CoA chain elongation, 1 -acylglycerophosphate (1 -acyl-GP) acyltransferase and 1 -acylglycerophosphocholine (1 -acyl-GPC) acyltransferase, but not 2 -acylglycerophosphocholine (2 -acyl-GPC) acyltransferase in liver microsomes. The treatment of guinea-pigs with clofibric acid did not cause {{any change in the}} activities of these enzymes. The treatment of guinea-pigs with <b>tiadenol</b> caused a slight, but significant, increase in the activities of 1 -acyl-GP acyltransferase and 1 -acyl-GPC acyltransferase. The treatment of rats and mice with either clofibric acid or <b>tiadenol</b> increased markedly the proportion of 18 : 1 and decreased greatly the proportion of 18 : 0 in liver microsomal phosphatidylcholine. However, there is a considerable difference in the effects of the two peroxisome proliferators on the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine between rats and mice. The treatment of guinea-pigs with either of the two peroxisome proliferators caused no change in acyl composition of phosphatidylcholine. The possible role of stearoyl-CoA desaturation in the regulation of acyl composition of phosphatidylcholine was discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{peroxisome}} proliferators clofibric acid (p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid), <b>tiadenol</b> [2, 2 '-(decamethylenedithio) diethanol] and perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) on hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturation in male and female rats were compared. Treatment of male rats with the three peroxisome proliferators increased markedly the activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Administration of clofibric acid or <b>tiadenol</b> to female rats increased greatly the hepatic activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, {{the extent of the}} increases being slightly less pronounced than those of male rats. In contrast with the other two peroxisome proliferators, however, PFOA did not change the activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in female rats. Hormonal manipulations revealed that this sex-related difference in the effect of PFOA on stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity is strongly dependent on testosterone. The increase in stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity by peroxisome proliferators was not accompanied by any notable increases in the microsomal content of cytochrome b 5 or the activity of NADH: cytochrome b 5 reductase. The administration of the peroxisome proliferators greatly altered the acyl composition of hepatic phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (namely the proportions of C 18 : 1 and C 20 : 3,n- 9 fatty acids increased in both phospholipids), and the alterations were partially associated with the increase in stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of fatty acid-binding protein in rat liver was examined by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, by Western blotting and by quantifying the fluorescence enhancement achieved on the binding of the fluorescent probe 11 -(dansylamino) undecanoic acid. A 2 - 3 -fold {{increase in the}} {{concentration of}} this protein produced by treatment of rats with the peroxisome proliferator <b>tiadenol</b> was readily detected; however, only a small variation in the concentration of the protein due to a diurnal rhythm was observed. This result contradicts the 7 - 10 -fold variation previously reported for this protein [Hargis, Olson, Clarke & Dempsey (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1988 - 1991]...|$|E
40|$|Inductions by perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) of hepatomegaly, peroxisomal beta-oxidation, microsomal 1 -acylglycerophosphocholine acyltransferase and cytosolic {{long-chain}} acyl-CoA hydrolase {{were compared}} in liver {{between male and}} female rats. Marked inductions of these four parameters were seen concurrently in liver of male rats, whereas the inductions in liver of female rats were far less pronounced. The sex-related difference in the response of rat liver to PFOA was much more marked than that seen with p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (clofibric acid) or 2, 2 '-(decamethylenedithio) diethanol (<b>tiadenol).</b> Hormonal manipulations revealed that this sex-related difference in the inductions is strongly dependent on sex hormones, namely that testosterone is necessary for the inductions, whereas oestradiol prevented the inductions by PFOA...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} indicates that some compounds which produce hepatic peroxisome proliferation in rats also appear to produce Leydig cell adenomas, and some also affect the serum concentrations of testosterone and estradiol. Previous studies with the peroxisome proliferator ammonium perfluorooctanoate showed a direct effect on Leydig cells to alter steroidogenesis. It was therefore proposed that peroxisome proliferators in general may directly affect Leydig cell function to produce Leydig cell tumors by some undetermined mechanism. The present study investigated whether the following peroxisome proliferators directly affect Leydig cell function in vitro: 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, ammonium perfluorooctanoate, acetylsalicylic acid, clofibric acid, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil, <b>tiadenol,</b> tibric acid, trichloroacetic acid, trichloroethylene, and Wyeth 14, 643. Leydig cells, isolated from adult CrhCDBR rats (12 - 16 weeks old), were treated with peroxisom...|$|E
