50|$|Summary {{judgment}} is rarely granted in Virginia courts {{because it is}} easy for either party to raise a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact. Unlike federal courts, where claims must be accompanied by an affidavit in order to raise a fact issue, Virginia courts treat the pleadings themselves as allegations of fact sufficient to create a genuine issue for resolution by a trial. Summary judgment in Virginia is not available in divorce and annulment cases.|$|E

5000|$|Knowledge of infringement: 2.a) Some {{employees}} had interacted with 55 of 199 infringing videos (by liking, commenting, or reviewing). There was a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> {{as to whether}} Vimeo acquired [...] "actual or red flag knowledge" [...] of the infringing videos due to these actions by their employees; 2.b) A series of emails by Vimeo employees commenting on or ignoring infringing content was insufficient to establish [...] "willful blindness" [...] {{on the part of}} Vimeo.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Wilson {{recorded}} and released his solo album Brian Wilson Presents Smile, a reinterpretation of the Smile project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the Mail On Sunday that included Beach Boys songs {{he had recently}} rerecorded, five of which he co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings.

50|$|The voting {{pattern of}} the en banc court in SRI was 5-1-5. The lead opinion insisted on a remand for trial on the reverse {{doctrine}} of equivalents issue, but found literal infringement. One judge found <b>triable</b> <b>issues</b> on reverse doctrine of equivalents, literal infringement, and prosecution history estoppel. The other five judges dissented, stating that (1) there was no literal infringement when the claims were properly construed {{in the light of}} the specification and the arguments made during the prosecution history, and (2) the undisputed fact record indicates that the accused device operates in a fundamentally different way from the patented device and therefore cannot infringe under the reverse doctrine of equivalents.|$|R
5000|$|On December 10, 2009, {{the judge}} denied Katzer's motion, {{concluding}} that Jacobsen could copyright {{the selection and}} ordering of the decoder definition files and could show monetary damages for copyright infringement. In the same ruling, he granted in part and denied in part Jacobsen's motion, finding that Katzer did register the decoderpro.com domain name in bad faith, that Katzer is liable for copyright infringement of the decoder definition files and that Katzer's counterclaim for copyright infringement is barred by the doctrine of laches (damaged argument), and ruled that Jacobsen had a license under an [...] "Implied License" [...] doctrine. The judge did not rule on damages for copyright infringement and determined that the questions of Katzer's knowledge or intent in removing copyright notices are <b>triable</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the court}} denied the motion for summary {{judgment}} regarding the class action Fourth Amendment claim. The Honorable Shira A.

[...] The court held that regardless of the changes required by Daniels, et al. v. the City of New York, the City's purported corrective actions were insufficient to negate the inference that intentional discrimination was the City's “standard operating procedure.” ...|$|E
50|$|Fox {{contended that}} Dish {{distributed}} Fox’s programing over the Internet in breach of contractual provisions. The District Court concluded that Dish’s users retransmits Fox’s programing within the contractual authorization provided by Fox. Nothing in the parties’ agreement expressly limits retransmission to {{the context of}} a DBS-based multicast. Dish does not distribute Fox’s programing; it is the user who transmits the programing to herself or other members of her household, which does not fulfill the meaning of distribution in the statue. However, the district court held that Dish Anywhere and Hopper Transfers breach the No Copying provision of the parties’ agreement because Dish’s subscribers can place-shift outside their homes. Fox did not give Dish its consent to offer this service to subscribers for use outside home. Fair Use is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement, but parties are free to bargain away their rights to make fair use of copyrighted material under contractual agreements. The district court denied the summary judgment in this point because considered that there was a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact as to the damages flowing from the breach.Fox also contended that PTAT infringes the Non-Distribution Provision. The district court held that Dish did not distribute anything, because PTAT automatically recorded already permissible content to a subscriber and does not disseminate those recordings beyond user’s home. Fox contended that the QA copies breached the No-Copying Provision. The district court agreed with Fox considering that there is a breach of contract remedy to solve the dispute. The reasonable amount of royalties that Dish should pay for the period that used QA copies is a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact.|$|E
5000|$|After Equilon {{began to}} operate, {{a class of}} 23,000 Texaco and Shell gas station owners filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that, by unifying {{gasoline}} prices under the two brands, petitioners had violated the per se rule against price fixing that the Supreme Court had long recognized under § 1 of the Sherman Act. The District Court awarded summary judgment to Texaco and Shell Oil. It determined that the rule of reason governed the plaintiffs' claim, under which only [...] "unreasonable restraints of trade" [...] were prohibited by the Sherman Act. Because they had eschewed rule of reason analysis, the plaintiffs had failed to raise a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2006, Brad Greenspan {{launched}} a website, called freemyspace.com, and published reports {{that called for}} the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance to investigate News Corp's acquisition of MySpace as [...] "one of the largest merger and acquisition scandals in U.S. history." [...] The report's main allegation is that News Corp. should have valued MySpace at US$20 billion rather than US$327 million, and had, in effect, defrauded Intermix shareholders through an unfair deal process. The report received a mixed response from financial commentators in the press. A lawsuit led by Greenspan challenging the acquisition was dismissed by a judge.Greenspan's claims were validated when in June 2010 Judge George H. King {{ruled in favor of}} shareholdersin a summary judgement decision. According to Gretchen Morgenson of the New York Times, [...] "Viewed as a whole, Judge King wrote, the evidence indicates that “there are at least <b>triable</b> <b>issues</b> of fact” about whether Mr. Rosenblatt acted in good faith or tilted the auction in favor of the News Corporation “for a purpose other than maximizing shareholder value.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Metronews was an {{alternative}} weekly newspaper published from 1983 to 1998 in Fresno, California which was {{noted for its}} strong criticism of city government, entertainment and arts coverage, and provocative [...] "It's A Crime" [...] coverage of unusual police reports which often revealed embarrassing circumstances {{of those who were}} the subjects of police reports.Published by Press Communications Inc. and edited by Marc Jackson, the 50,000 circulation periodical also contained rare interviews from numerous politicians as well as personalities as diverse as economist Milton Friedman, singer Peggy Lee, prostitute Stephanie Smith (who was charged with attempted murder because she was HIV positive), and others.Due to the controversy often generated by the newspaper, several individuals attempted to stop the distribution of Metronews, and persuaded the City of Fresno to sue the newspaper publisher and editor under an ordinance which restricted the door-to-door distribution of newspapers and advertisements when the occupant of a residence posted a small [...] "Do Not Deliver" [...] sign.Although independent carriers delivered Metronews and the newspaper had implemented procedures attempting to prevent delivery to addresses of people who had notified Metronews that they do not wish to receive the paper, the City of Fresno filed a complaint against Jackson and Press Communications to enjoin them from causing distribution of unauthorized newspapers to posted residences and from violating Fresno Municipal Code section 8-808. The City alleged Metronews repeatedly had caused unauthorized newspapers to be distributed in violation of the ordinance and threatened to continue such distribution. Metronews cross-complained alleging the ordinance was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to the newspaper in this particular case, and sought to enjoin its enforcement. Metronews filed a motion for summary judgment on both the complaint and cross-complaint. Metronews submitted evidence regarding the procedures it used to avoid any violation of the ordinance. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Metronews on the city's complaint when the city failed to present any evidence to support its claim that Metronews violated the ordinance. The court denied summary judgment on the cross-complaint, finding that although the ordinance was facially valid, there were <b>triable</b> <b>issues</b> of material fact regarding its constitutionality as applied to Metronews. Copies of Metronews were not introduced into evidence and the court concluded it could not decide the issue {{as a matter of law}} because it could not determine whether the paper was [...] "commercial speech or political speech."Following a trial, the court issued its decision in which it adopted the previous ruling that the ordinance was constitutional on its face and found [...] "no evidence that said regulation is unconstitutional as applied to Metronews." [...] The court entered judgment in favor of the city. Metronews appealed.The appellate court overturned the trial court decision as violating the First Amendment.In the case, the City of Fresno argued the delivery of religious literature or campaign literature is properly exempt from the ordinance because these categories of speech are entitled to a [...] "higher degree of protection under the Constitution". Metronews strongly disagreed.In City of Fresno v. Press Communications, Inc., the Court sided with Metronews stating, [...] "The possibility that speech may be [...] "undesirable" [...] or [...] "unpopular" [...] is not an acceptable basis for the government to curtail speech which is otherwise protected by the First Amendment. (citations) Furthermore, the trial court's reasoning is based upon an unproved assumption that advertisements and unsubscribed newspapers are universally less desirable and less popular than other types of written material (e.g., religious, political or charitable publications) that may be delivered to a home or business without the prior authorization of the occupant. Even assuming this could be shown, it requires a judgment based upon the relative value of the content of speech which is forbidden under the First Amendment. (citations)" [...] The court also awarded Metronews attorneys fees finding that the case [...] "enforces constitutional rights necessarily affects the public interest and confers a significant benefit upon the general public." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the preclusion of jury trials in actions which contemplate both legal and equitable relief. Part II of this article {{addresses the}} constitutional and statutory history of New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”) Section 4101 concerning <b>issues</b> <b>triable</b> by a jury and the dichotomy between those actions triable by a jury and equitable actions triable by the court alone. Part III of this article addresses the interplay between CPLR Sections 4101 and 4102, concerning demand and waiver of trial by jury, and the analysis developed by the courts to determine whether a jury trial has been waived in the context of civil actions seeking both legal and equitable relief arising out of the same transaction. Part IV of this article addresses the evolution toward non-jury trial in England and Wales and the policy in favor of non-jury trials in civil actions today. This article is written to encourage New York advocates to examine closely the analyses developed and the results which have emerged concerning waiver of a jury trial by the joinder of law and equity claims. Trial by jury, so fundamental to the American and New York systems of jurisprudence, should not be deemed waived, and is not waived, merely because litigants seek both legal and equitable relief arising from the same transaction. There is a careful analysis meant to be employed to protect the sacred right to a trial by jury, and an advocate confronted with the issue should make certain that the court properly utilizes it...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, after {{a number}} of {{witnesses}} have been deposed, the parties will have enough information that they can reasonably predict the outcome of a prospective trial, and may decide to arrive at a compromise settlement, thus avoiding trial and preventing additional costs of litigation. Accordingly, while most depositions are not videotaped, opposing counsel may use the opportunity to get an impression of the witness's affect and appearance, because these are telling factors as to how that person will present in front of a jury. Furthermore, deposition transcripts are frequently submitted in support of motions for summary judgment as evidence that there is no <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact. The moving party may use transcripts to argue that even if all the testimony given at deposition was given again at trial, no reasonable factfinder could find in the opponent's favor on a material issue of fact. The rationale is that generally, a witness must give consistent testimony on all material issues of fact both at deposition and at trial (unless there is a very good reason for changing one's answers), or else the inconsistencies can and will be used to impeach his credibility.|$|E
40|$|In Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines Inc., the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{held that}} the {{unauthorized}} access {{of the content of}} a secure website is a violation of the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act. This is the first case to determine whether unauthorized accessing of a secure private website is a violation of the Wiretap Act. This decision is contrary to an earlier decision by the Fifth Circuit in United. States v. Turk, which {{held that the}} Wiretap Act required contemporaneous transmission and acquisition of the communication. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the scope of protection under the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act depends on the degree of intrusion, not on whether the communication is in transit or storage. Subsequently, content on a secure website is an 2 ̆ 2 electronic communication 2 ̆ 2 within the meaning of the Acts and is therefore protected from unlawful interception. The Ninth Circuit also concluded that defendant 2 ̆ 7 s unlawful interception of the content on plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s secure website, followed by its disclosure to an opposing union faction and engagement in coercion and intimidation, raised a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact, and remanded Konop 2 ̆ 7 s claims under the Railway labor Act...|$|E
40|$|In Headley v. Church of Scientology International, the Ninth Circuit faced a {{particularly}} sensitive question involving {{the limits of}} the TVPA and the application of the ministerial exception. In Headley, former ministers brought TVPA forced-labor claims against the Church of Scientology (the “Church”). The Church argued before the district court that the plaintiffs’ labor was not forced, and that the ministerial exception applied to effectively bar the plaintiffs’ claims. The district court agreed, holding that the instances of physical abuse alleged did not raise a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> of fact as to the Headleys’ forced-labor claims. The court also waded into constitutional waters, finding that the ministerial exception formed a second bar to the plaintiffs’ forced-labor claims. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court’s position that courts may not scrutinize certain aspects of the minister-church relationship. Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit avoided {{the question of whether the}} First Amendment’s ministerial exception—usually invoked only in employment-law contexts—also applies to forced-labor claims under the TVPA. Instead, the court simply looked to the text of the TVPA to find that the plaintiffs’ labor was not, within the meaning of the statute, forced 2 ̆ 2 by means of’ serious harm, threats, or any other improper methods. ” In affirming the district court’s grant of summary judgment, the Ninth Circuit found that the Headleys had voluntarily joined and worked for the Church because they believed in the Church’s doctrine and in the personal commitments they made to the Church. Pointing to the Headleys’ ability to leave the Church, and their failure to do so for well over a decade, the court found that the plaintiffs simply were not forced to remain in their respective conditions...|$|E
40|$|Prisoners {{who believe}} their {{constitutional}} rights were violated through deficient medical care can pursue {{a cause of}} action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. To prevail on this claim, the prisoner must show that a medical provider acted with deliberate indifference towards a serious medical condition. Ordinary medical negligence is not a constitutional claim simply because the victim is a prisoner. Yet, circuits are split on exactly what physician behavior constitutes deliberate indifference. Courts have given varying degrees of deference to a physician 2 ̆ 7 s case-specific medical determination. Courts debate whether palliative care—relieving pain without an effort to cure—is enough; and whether constitutionalizing medical malpractice may have negative consequences on prison health care systems. In Petties v. Carter, the Seventh Circuit considered whether a physician 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for medical treatment created a <b>triable</b> <b>issue</b> {{as to whether or}} not he acted with deliberate indifference. The plaintiff suffered from a ruptured Achilles 2 ̆ 7 tendon. Standard treatment protocol for this injury includes, among other things, receiving a splint, which serves to immobilize the foot. The plaintiff alleged that, in not prescribing a splint, the defendants exacerbated his injury. However, the defendants contended that they were not deliberately indifferent; rather than using a splint, they decided to immobilize Petties 2 ̆ 7 foot through use of crutches, lay-in meals, and a lower bunk assignment. The Seventh Circuit, in a 6 - 3 decision, reversed the district court 2 ̆ 7 s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. This Note argues that the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s reversal failed to adequately defer to: 1) precedent precluding from liability actors who demonstrate a reasonable response to risk of injury, 2) public policy support for respecting case-specific medical judgment, and 3) state medical malpractice laws, which are more equitable and efficient in addressing claims of deficient medical care...|$|E
