Protective actions of Panax notoginseng against cerebral ischemia, beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, and hemostatic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, hepatoprotective, renoprotective and estrogen-like activities have been illustrated. In the present study, the effects of <b>trilinolein</b> on the growth of non-small cell lung carcinoma A 549 were investigated. It was found that the exposure of A 549 cells to <b>trilinolein</b> resulted in the growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis in a dose- and time- dependent manner. <b>Trilinolein</b> treatment induced the upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 expression, which was associated with the proteolytic activation of caspases and the concomitant degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein.

To {{determine}} the molecular species composition of lecithins ofdifferent nascent lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins (HDL), very low density lipo-proteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (CM) were {{isolated from the}} mesenteric lymph of rats.

Molecular species oflec-ithin were directly isolated by reverse phase high perfor-mance liquid chromatography. In fasted animals, the lec-ithin compositions of lymph HDL and VLDL were vir-tually the same and closely resembled the lecithin composition of intestinal mucosa. When bile lecithin was eliminated (by bile diversion), there was a marked change in lecithin composition of all lipoprotein and mucosal samples, which was most notable for a reduction in 16 : 0 -species (which are predominant in bile) and a relative increase in the corresponding 18 : 0 -species.

Two Staphylococcus aureus lipases, named SAL 1 and SAL 2, were identified in the community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain USA 300, which, presumably, are produced and function to de-grade triglycerides to release free fatty acids. We show that the SAL 2 lipase {{is one of the}} most abundant proteins secreted by USA 300 and is proteolytically processed from the 72 -kDa proSAL 2 to the 44 -kDamature SAL 2 by the metalloprotease aureoly-sin. We show that spent culture supernatants had lipase activity on both short- and long-chain fatty acid substrates and that de-letion of gehB, encoding SAL 2, resulted in the complete loss of these activities. With the use of gas chromatography-mass spec-trometry, we show that SAL 2 hydrolyzed <b>trilinolein</b> to linoleic acid, a fatty acid with known antistaphylococcal properties. When added to cultures of USA 300, <b>trilinolein</b> and, to a lesser extent, triolein inhibited growth in a SAL 2 -dependent manner. This ef-fect was shown to be due to the enzymatic activity of SAL 2 on these triglycerides, since the catalytically inactive SAL 2 Ser 412 Ala mutant was incapable of hydrolyzing the triglycerides or yielding delayed growth in their presence.

Addition of oil body PL or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, with or without charged stearylamine/stearic acid, or oleosins, to the medium before sonication provided limited stabilization effects to the TAG droplets. High stability was achieved only when the TAG were sonicated with both oil body PL (or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) and oleosins of proportions similar to or higher than those in the native oil bodies.

Cholesterol degraded faster when heated alone than {{in the presence of}} triacylglycerols; moreover, the more unsaturated the matrix, the slower the degradation of cholesterol. Both cholesterol and triacylglycerols degradation fit a first order kinetic model (R(2) > 0. 9), except for the tristearin sample. Cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) and peroxides were formed during the heating treatment. The presence of any type of lipid matrix postponed and decreased the maximum concentration of both oxidation parameters. Maximum total COPs concentrations were achieved at 20 min in neat cholesterol, 120 min in tristearin and triolein and 180 min in polyunsaturated matrix samples. 7 -Ketocholesterol was the main COP in most cases during the whole heating treatment. Both the presence of triacylglycerols and their unsaturation degree inhibited cholesterol thermooxidation at 180 °C...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{radicals}} {{were generated}} by UV photolysis of samples of <b>trilinolein,</b> at 77 K and under a controlled atmosphere. The resulting EPR spectra clearly {{show that the}} amount of radicals is dependent on the purity of the lipid, the exposure to visible light {{in the presence of a}} photosensitizer and oxygen, and, finally, the presence of an antioxidant. These solid state EPR experiments indicate that if all of the elements for the production of singlet oxygen (Rose Bengal, molecular oxygen, and visible light) are not present, primary radicals are practically not generated. They also point out the various steps of the oxidation mechanism: formation of singlet oxygen, which reacts with the lipid to form a hydroperoxide; and photolytic formation of the hydroxyl radical, which reacts with the frozen lipid to generate primary lipidic radicals. This constitutes a new method for investigating lipid oxidation and studying the influence of photosensitizers and molecules that are likely to react with singlet oxygen...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of R(-) apomorphine, S(+) apomorphine and dopamine on the oxidation kinetics of two polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (cholesteryl linoleate (CL) and <b>Trilinolein</b> (TL)) was investigated. The oxidation was initiated by free radicals generated through thermal decomposition of 2. 2 '-Azobis(2 -methyl-propionitrile) (AMPN) in phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) thermostated at 50 degrees C. The hydroperoxides formed {{were determined by}} iodine titration using a diode array spectrophotometer at 290 nm. Both enantiomers of apomorphine as well as dopamine exerted an inhibitory effect. Tocopherol (alpha-tocopherol) and ascorbic acid were used as controls. The former inhibited while ascorbic acid facilitated the oxidation reaction. These results are discussed in relation with the possible role of oxidative injury in parkinsonism and the usefulness of apomorphine in elevating "on-off" episodes. On this basis, the non-dopaminergic enantiomer of apomorphine (S(+) -isomer) is put foward to test the importance of its radical scavenging properties in parkinsonism which could eventually lead to a therapeutic alternative with less side effects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} total phenols and flavonoids, liposoluble antioxidants, fatty acid and {{triacylglycerol}} profiles, and oxidative status of oil obtained from Lycium europaeum fruits following supercritical CO 2 extraction (at 30 MPa and 40 °C). Linoleic (52 %), palmitic (18 %), oleic (13 %), and -linolenic (6 %) {{were the main}} oil fatty acids, while <b>trilinolein</b> and palmitodilinolein/oleodilinolein represented the main triacylglycerols. The oil was characterized by high levels of all-trans-zeaxanthin and all-trans [...] carotene (755 and 332 μg/g of oil, respectively), -tocopherol (308 μg/g of oil), total phenols (13. 6 mg gallic acid equivalents/g of oil), and total flavonoids (6. 8 mg quercetin equivalents/g of oil). The oil showed radical scavenging activities (ABTS and DPPH assays) and inhibited Caco- 2 cell growth. Moreover, the incubation of differentiated Caco- 2 cells with a non-toxic oil concentration (100 μg/mL) induced a significant intracellular accumulation of essential fatty acids. The results qualify L. europaeum oil as a potential source for food/pharmaceutical applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition (total oil content, fatty acids, triacylglycerols (TAGs) and polar compounds) of six walnuts (Juglans regia L.) cultivars (Lauzeronne, Franquette, Hartley, Local pt, Local gd and Parisienne) collected from Mateur (north of Tunisia) was evaluated. The major fatty acids {{found in the}} walnut oils are linoleic acid (60. 42 - 65. 77 %), oleic acid (13. 21 - 19. 94 %) and linolenic acid (7. 61 - 13 %). The TAG species were mainly composed of <b>trilinolein</b> (LLL), dilinoleoyl-linolenoyl-glycerol, dilinoleoyl-oleoyl-glycerol and palmitoyl-dilinoleoyl-glycerol classes. The results revealed that Local pt variety has {{the highest level of}} oil (62. 56 %), linoleic acid (65. 77 %) and LLL (33. 48 %). Significant differences among oil samples were observed, therefore showing a great variability in the oil composition among cultivars.

30|$|The {{variations}} in scavenging {{activities of the}} methanol and chloroform extracts are most probably attributed to the differences in polarities of the phytochemicals [43], and also the classes of compounds extracted by the two solvents. Phytochemical investigation of some plants from Northern Africa exhibiting antioxidant and related activities led to isolation of approximately 56 compounds (Table  6 and Fig.  3). The most potent compounds included; nifedipine (47), <b>trilinolein</b> (42), usnic acid monoacetate (41), 5 –bromosalicylaldehyde (39), naphtho [2, 1 –b]furan- 2 (1  h)- one,decahydro- 3 α, 6, 6, 9 α–tetramethy (38) and 2, 3 dihydroxypropyl elaidate (47) (obtained from the leaf extract of Solanum nigrum) with % RSA of 78.4 %, 68.5 %, 74 %, 72.5 %, 74 % and 76 % at 100  μg/mL respectively [44], and catechin (120) obtained from the ethyl acetate leaf extract of Hydnora abyssinica with % RSA of 68.5 % at 1  mM [45].

40|$|Palm olein {{and sesame}} seed oil were blended at varying ratios; {{changes in their}} {{physicochemical}} and sensory characteristics were determined. Increasing amounts of SSO (from 10 to 20, 30 and 40 %) and decreasing amounts of PO (from 90, 80, 70 and 60 %) in the blends, results in increase {{in the degree of}} unsaturation. FFA increased from 0. 25 % (90 PO: 10 SSO) to 0. 65 %. (60 PO: 40 SSO). Blending altered FA composition of palmitic and linoleic acids, which results in a significant change in <b>trilinolein,</b> dioleoyl-linoleoyl-glycerol, dipalmitoyl- 3 -linoleoyl glycerol and dipalmitoyl- 3 -oleoyl glycerol contents. A pleasant nutty flavor was imparted. Melting and crystallization temperatures shifted to lower values from 12. 65 to 11. 03, 10. 44 and 9. 74 ºC and from - 6. 31 to - 6. 99, - 7. 38 and - 8. 31 ºC, respectively. Sensory quality of banana chips fried in the oil blends showed no acceptability differences between them. All blends received high scores for all sensory attributes tested and overall acceptability. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA design {{methodology}} for biodiesel production from waste cooking palm oil is proposed. The proposed method is flexible to the biodiesel process using various catalyst types: alkali and acid catalyst in homogenous and heterogeneous forms, and different process: enzyme process and supercritical process. A two-step approach of hydrolysis and esterification processes is also considered. Waste cooking palm oil {{consists of a}} mixture of triglyceride (e. g., trilaurin, tripalmitin, triolein, tristearin, <b>trilinolein</b> and trilinolenin) and free fatty acids (e. g., lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic and linolenic acid). A driving force approach and thermodynamic insight are employed to design separation units (e. g., flash separator and distillation) minimizing the energy consumption. Steady-state simulations of the developed biodiesel processes are performed and economic analysis is used to find a suitable biodiesel process. The results show that based on a net present value, the heterogeneous acid catalyzed process is the best process for biodiesel production. With the {{design methodology}}, the proposed biodiesel process can save the energy requirement of 41. 5 %, compared with a conventional process...|$|E
40|$|Lipoxygenase (LOX) -catalysed {{degradation}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids {{is supposed to}} be a major cause of undesirable off-flavour development in legumes. In the present study, a photometric LOX assay including adequate sample workup was adapted to lupin seeds, kernels and flakes, respectively. Optimum reaction conditions were at pH 7. 5 using a phosphate buffer concentration of 150 mmol l− 1 without the addition of sodium chloride. The LOX activities of different lupin species and varieties were compared. Significant variations among the species and varieties ranging from 50 to 1004 units mg− 1 protein were determined, being significantly lower than soybean LOX activity. Hulling and flaking of the seeds resulted in a 15 % increase of LOX activity. In contrast to soy and other legumes, LOX from lupin only converted free fatty acids, whereas <b>trilinolein</b> and β-carotene were not oxidised. Consequently, according to the established classification, lupin LOX activity may be assigned to the LOX type- 1, which, to the best of our knowledge, was demonstrated for the first time...|$|E
