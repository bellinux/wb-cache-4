Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>of</b> Bambi.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>video</b> <b>of</b> {{the song}} {{features}} {{the majority of}} the film's cast at a celebration event where this song is performed. To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a marigold flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E
