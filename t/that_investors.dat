Consistent with Elton, Gruber, and Busse (1998), who show <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment does not enter the return generating process, our tests do not detect investor sentiment in a capital market that is more susceptible to small investor sentiment. Our results provide additional support against the claim <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment represents an independent and systematic asset pricing risk...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{investor}} sentiment and its relationships to stock returns and volatility in the Chinese stock market. By using mutual fund flows {{as a substitute for}} investor sentiment for different stocks, this study finds <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment has a tremendous impact on stock returns in the Chinese stock market.

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} multiplicate {{relationships between}} investor attention and gold futures return. The Vector Auto Regression (VAR) estimates demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> attention exhibits {{significant impact on}} gold futures returns and the effect can be positive or negative {{depending on how much}} time has elapsed since this effect. Reversely, VAR results demonstrate past gold return typically has a sizable impact on investor attention with a positive coefficient. Following the findings, they investigate the influences of four types of interaction terms and the results suggest that the attention-return relationship is significantly altered by past return, past trader positions, the severity of past attention, and the presence of extreme economic conditions. The authors also find <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> attention is closely associated with futures basis, indicating <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> attention incorporates meaningful information about expected futures prices, thus providing an alternative explanation of economic rationale for the attention-return relationship.

40|$|Behavioral theory predicts <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> {{overconfidence}} causes overpricing because overconfident investors {{overestimate the}} precision of their information and underestimate risk. We test this prediction by using a measure of investor overconfidence derived from the characteristics and holdings of U. S. equity mutual fund managers. We find that firms with more overconfident investors are relatively overvalued based on M/B and two misvaluation measures. The impact of investor overconfidence on firm value is stronger among stocks with greater arbitrage risk. Furthermore, firms with more overconfident investors issue more equity and make more investments. Overall, our findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> overconfidence has {{a significant impact on}} firm value and corporate decisions...|$|R

5000|$|Portfolios can be {{analyzed}} in a mean-variance framework, with every investor holding the portfolio with the lowest possible return variance consistent with <b>that</b> <b>investor's</b> chosen level of expected return (called a minimum-variance portfolio), if the returns on the assets are jointly elliptically distributed, including the special case {{in which they are}} jointly normally distributed. [...] Under mean-variance analysis, it can be shown that every minimum-variance portfolio given a particular expected return (that is, every efficient portfolio) can be formed as a combination of any two efficient portfolios. If the investor's optimal portfolio has an expected return that is between the expected returns on two efficient benchmark portfolios, then <b>that</b> <b>investor's</b> portfolio can be characterized as consisting of positive quantities of the two benchmark portfolios.|$|R
25|$|As {{with all}} infrastructural {{investments}} in the energy sector, developing storage facilities is capital intensive.

25|$|The {{maintenance}} of large current account deficits via financial account surpluses became problematic as investors became more risk averse to emerging market exposure {{as a consequence}} of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5billion IMF-led international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar.

25|$|Hedge {{funds are}} {{structured}} to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) {{and are not}} required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent <b>that</b> <b>investors</b> generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so <b>that</b> <b>investors</b> generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E

The results indicate <b>that</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment plays a significant role in explaining subsequent mutual fund herding, especially on the sell-side. Specifically, the evidence is consistent with the funds sharing an aversion to stocks that have previously exhibited higher optimistic sentiment, supporting the sentiment countering hypothesis.
