5|$|The {{end of the}} war brought {{national}} attention to Oak Ridge, and there was bad publicity about the conditions that the Black residents were living in. Roane-Anderson dusted off plans for a village for them. The new village, called Scarboro, was built where the Gamble Valley <b>Trailer</b> <b>Camp</b> had once stood. Construction commenced in 1948, and the first residents moved in two years later. It housed the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the <b>trailer</b> <b>camp</b> at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E

50|$|Initially rated an F1, but {{upgraded}} to an F2, the strongest {{of the evening}} tornadoes touched down south of Barry's Bay, {{in the town of}} Combermere at 8:30 p.m. EDT. With the video footage and reports, the tornado did extensive damage in the town and a nearby <b>trailer</b> <b>camp</b> site. Numerous trees and hydro poles were snapped. Two train cars were lifted off a rail line. A local Home Hardware store warehouse was also completely destroyed, several structures including trailers were also heavily damaged or destroyed and cottages and decks sustained significant damage with possible reports of cottages being thrown on the shores and in some cases into the nearby Madawaska River.

During this period Olson also wrote Ultimate Guide to Lesbian & Gay Film and Video (1996). The book was based on Olson's BA thesis,. [...] Her next book was The Queer Movie Poster Book (2004). This book was suggested in 1991 by Stuart Marshall, who recommended Olson pitch the idea to London's Gay Men's Press. Although the book was turned down by both them and Serpent's Tail, to whom the idea was pitched as a follow up to her previous book, Olson was eventually commissioned {{to write the book}} in 2002. Olson based the work in part on her own collection of such material, which she has subsequently donated to San Franciscoâ€™s GLBT Historical Society. Her collection was exhibited at the San Francisco Public Library in 2004, with Olson delivering an accompanying lecture.|$|E
