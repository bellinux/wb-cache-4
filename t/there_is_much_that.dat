In {{addition to}} the source material and earlier drafts of several portions of The Lord of the Rings, these books greatly expand on the original material published in The Silmarillion, {{and in many cases}} diverge from it. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> Tolkien intended to revise but only sketched out in notes, and some new texts surfaced after the publication of The Silmarillion. These books also make it clear just how unfinished the later parts of The Silmarillion really were: some parts were never rewritten after the early versions in Lost Tales.|$|E
500|$|The Gulf of Aqaba is {{situated}} {{along the southern}} portion of the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault zone, a [...] transform fault that forms the barrier between the African plate and the Arabian Plate (Arabian-Nubian Shield). The left-lateral strike-slip fault connects the spreading center that forms the Red Sea in the south with the East Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the north. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> is not known about the DST, it is accepted that its transform motion began around 12–18 million years ago. Geologist A. M. Quennell, who is credited with first recognizing the movement along the fault in 1958, estimated the total displacement to be [...] while a similar study that included more regional influences resulted in an estimated slip of [...] That broader kinematic model translates into a slip rate of 8–10mm/year for {{the portion of the}} fault south of the Dead Sea.|$|E

60|$|Then {{followed}} a violent {{conversation in the}} Norse language, in which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> puzzling, and more that was amusing, for the Norwegian ladies were talkative and inquisitive.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> {{overlooked}} {{during the}} hurry and {{excitement of the}} previous day, which {{could be done to}} strengthen the palisade, as, for example, driving stakes at the foot of such posts as were not standing firmly, and securing the tops of others with braces on the inside.|$|R
60|$|One evening, he read me a play he had written. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> good in it, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> also faults (<b>there</b> <b>are</b> in some plays), {{and these}} I seized upon and made merry over. I {{could hardly have}} dealt out to the piece more {{unnecessary}} bitterness had I been a professional critic.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> a {{young woman}} may do for herself which I think you have done. A silly girl, though {{she had been a}} second Helen, would hardly have {{satisfied}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None will do that, Cis; but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> {{would be}} well in the notion, and I will {{consider}} of it. She is a maid of good conditions, and the mother is lonesome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can change}} that; I can manage with less help {{and be more}} economical. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> we can go without. I wouldn't mind at all, Stephen, if it would help you to take things easily." ...|$|E
50|$|The mammals {{are such}} a widespread, varied and {{successful}} group of animals that Attenborough had previously devoted no fewer than five episodes of Life on Earth to them. Nevertheless, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> remained untold and behaviour that was not hitherto filmed. The Life of Mammals {{was intended to be}} his definitive account of the subject.|$|R
3000|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> concern <b>that</b> {{their lack}} of {{religious}} tolerance will affect attitudes towards the other religions in Indonesia.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> {{life outside}} the Church. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> the Church did not include. He thought of God, {{and of the}} whole blue rotunda of the day. That was {{something}} great and free. He thought of {{the ruins of the}} Grecian worship, and it seemed, a temple was never perfectly a temple, till it was ruined and mixed up with the winds and the sky and the herbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! madame, I pray {{you name}} me not till she be here! <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> hangs on it, more than I can tell at present, without doing harm; but I have a {{petition}} to prefer to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The two {{strands of}} joy and grief have been very closely twisted," [...] said Norman. [...] "That rose is {{shedding}} its fragrant leaves in its glory, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> should have chastened the overflowing gladness of to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{his life}} is more {{interesting}} than his poetry, I have constructed {{the early part of}} his life as a sort of romance. When one thinks of his father Bernardo, and so on, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> must be true." ...|$|E
60|$|Reluctantly, shyly, and {{yet with}} a certain gladness of heart, she gave way to his {{proposal}} that they should change places in the programme. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> {{she did not like}} in it, she said. It seemed to {{her as if she were}} taking the initiative by going and attending to the preliminaries. It was the man's part to do that, in her opinion, and was usually undertaken by him.|$|R
60|$|That {{which she}} saw {{relieved}} {{the strain of}} the long night vigil; but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> she did not see. She {{did not see the}} black face beneath the white hood, nor the file of ebon horsemen beyond the trail's bend riding slowly in the wake of their leader. These things she did not see at first, and so she leaned downward toward the approaching rider, a cry of welcome forming in her throat.|$|R
50|$|Despite strong {{positive}} reviews, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> speculations <b>that</b> Behadd {{follows the}} same plot of Hasina Moin's 1980 PTV classic story Gudiya - (Doll).|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Mrs. Osborn, with a {{resigned}} gesture, {{and then}} braced herself. [...] "But {{if you have}} got the money, it {{ought not to be}} used for speculation. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> needs to be done on the estate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not looked}} at it in that light," [...] the Bishop said naively. [...] "You must be wrong. I know that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> is sad and wicked in this world. I know that the Church has lost the--what you call the proletariat."* ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is indeed}} sooth,' replied the other lady. 'My lord hath ever been most good to me, and I have had joy of my sons. Yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> my mind forbodes and shrinks back from in dread, as I watch my son Richard's overmastering spirit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{certainly}} farmers," [...] John admitted, with a smile, [...] "and I don't think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> here <b>that</b> isn't {{of our own}} production." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{archaeologist}} {{and stone}} circle specialist Aubrey Burl {{noted that the}} stone circle builders {{would have had to}} undertake [...] "careful planning" [...] before they erected these monuments. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse and the preparation of stone holes. They may have also had to plot astronomical alignments, making the task more difficult.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was mother,' {{an answer}} {{which made her}} young mistresses again sigh over the remembrance of Rachel's disregarded advice. Her fate was left for {{consideration}} and consultation with Mr. Devereux, for Mr. Mohun, seeing himself to blame for having allowed her {{to be placed in}} a situation of so much trial, and thinking <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> good about her, did not like to send her to her home, where she was likely to learn nothing but what was bad.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear it," [...] I said with a sigh, [...] "at least I think I am. Meanwhile, {{fortunately}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> I can do at home; indeed {{a course of action}} has been suggested to me by an old friend who is now in authority." ...|$|E
60|$|I did so; if he {{were quite}} right he would have all truth, low as well as high; that is, he would be Nature and not Turner; but that is {{impossible}} to man. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> is wrong in him; much that is infinitely wrong in all human effort. But, nevertheless, in some an infinity of Betterness above other human effort.|$|E
60|$|Viewing the German {{people from}} an Anglo-Saxon standpoint, {{it may be}} that in this book I shall find {{occasion}} to criticise them: {{but on the other hand}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> we might learn from them; and in the matter of common sense, as applied to education, they can give us ninety-nine in a hundred and beat us with one hand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{archaeologist}} {{and stone}} circle specialist Aubrey Burl {{noted that the}} stone circle builders {{would have had to}} undertake [...] "careful planning" [...] before they erected these monuments. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse and the preparation of stone holes.

60|$|He {{went out}} and Festing lighted his pipe. Now {{he had come to}} a decision, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> needed thought; but, to begin with, he knew of a {{suitable}} piece of land. Living in camp, he had saved the most part of his pay, and had inherited a small sum from an English relative. In consequence, he could buy the land, build a comfortable wooden house, and have something over to carry him on until he sold his first crop.|$|R
60|$|If Master Hunt and Master Wingfield {{had been}} able to bring the others around to their way of thinking, Captain Smith would have taken his {{rightful}} place in the Council without delay. Instead of which, however, he remained on board the ship idle, when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he could have done better than any other, from the day on which we came in sight of Virginia, which was the fifteenth day of April, until the twenty-sixth day of June.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, I entreat thee but {{to grant}} me one moment longer, for of a truth <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> my mind cannot grasp. Of thy god {{we will not}} speak. Whoever he be, as thou dost worship him, I will be content to worship by thy side. But that {{will come in the}} {{fullness}} of time. Dost love me, my dear lord?" ...|$|E
60|$|V. In Professor Haeckel's speculations on Phylogeny, or the {{genealogy}} {{of animal}} forms, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> is profoundly interesting, and his suggestions are always supported by sound knowledge and great ingenuity. Whether one agrees or disagrees with him, one {{feels that he}} has forced the mind into lines of thought {{in which it is}} more profitable to go wrong than to stand still.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Wulf, for {{answering}} my request so speedily. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> I would {{ask you about}} my lord. I hear of him only by general report, for although {{from time to time}} I send him messages I give him no opportunity for writing to me, and I know that he has respected my wishes, and has caused no search to be made for me." ...|$|E
60|$|After what Mistress Barbara had said, Susan was on thorns that Cis {{should hear}} the letter; but that good young lady, hating the {{expressions}} therein herself, and hating it still {{more for the}} girl, bethought her of asking permission to take Mistress Cicely to her own chamber, there to assist her in the folding of some of her laces, and Mary consented. It <b>was</b> well, for <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> made the English-bred Susan's cheeks glow and her ears tingle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{know the}} feeling well. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> ought to <b>be</b> done {{and it seems}} impossible. But {{what did you want}} to do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 10. [...] "The Train": ... is the story. We {{find out}} that he really didn't {{communicate}} anything to her, and she isn't coming back. Although we're getting all of this story from him, she never got any of this. If she had heard this album, she might have come home. She never saw this side of him. When I think about this in retrospect, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not done. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unfinished. It gives the story a very deep resonance.|$|R
