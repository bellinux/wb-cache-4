In all lines of tFinistsre'sclothing range, performance and sustainability are key factors. The products have been well reviewed {{by a number of}} sources for both their performance and green credentials. [...] Exclusive fabrics such as “C-shell” used in the “Anabatic Jacket” have been developed using recycled polyester and is fully recyclable {{at the end of the}} jackets lifespan. Recycled polyester is also used to make the fill in the range of insulated jackets as well as fleeces. The range of sweatshirts and Tshirts are all produced from Organic Cotton that is grown in Eastern Europe and spun in Portugal. Finisterre produce a range of merino wool layers including long johns, underwear, vests, and short and long sleeve t-shirts. The merino wool is sourced from Australia with full traceability reports to ensure none of the sheep subjected to the practice of mulesing. Although this is not organic wool with the traceability programme ensures better welfare for the sheep producing the wool. One of the biggest developments in the Finisterre's wool range is the Bowmont Project. Finisterre have also introduced an initiative called i-spy which is clear <b>tracability</b> resource for all their products and materials.|$|E

40|$|A common {{analytical}} technique involves using a Coxian {{distribution to}} model a general distribution #, where the Coxian distribution agrees with # {{on the first}} three moments. This technique is motivated by the analytical <b>tracability</b> of the Coxian distribution. Algorithms for mapping an input distribution # to a Coxian distribution largely hinge on knowing a priori the necessary and sufficient number of stages in the representative Coxian distribution. In this paper, we formally characterize the set of distributions # which are well-represented by an #-stage Coxian distribution, {{in the sense that}} the Coxian distribution matches the first three moments of #. We also discuss a few common, practical examples. Lastly, we derive a partial characterization of the set of busy period durations which are well-represented by an #-stage Coxian distribution...|$|E

40|$|Traceability {{schemes for}} {{broadcast}} encryption {{are defined by}} Chor, Fiat and Naor in [6] to protect against a possible coalition of users producing an illegal decryption key. Their scheme was then generalized by Stinson and Wei in [17]. These schemes assume that every user can decrypt the secret value. In this paper we discuss key preassigned <b>tracability</b> schemes, in which only the users in a specified privileged subset can decrypt. A new scheme is presented in this paper, which has better traceability than previous schemes. We also present a new threshold traceability scheme by using ramp scheme.

40|$|Distributed, {{heterogeneous}} {{systems are}} becoming very common, as globalized organizations integrate applications running on di#erent platforms, possibly written in di#erent languages. Component-interoperability standards such as CORBA are critical enablers of this trend. Certain non-functional requirements for such features as security, quality of service, flexible administration are specially critical to distributed heterogeneous systems. Unfortunately, such requirements are often formulated late, since they depend upon a particular installation, and/or change rapidly with {{business and political}} climate. Distributed, heterogeneous systems are particularly di#cult to evolve, since the elements are written in di#erent languages, and the operational environment is heterogenous and distributed. Adding "non-functional" features {{late in the game}} is specially hard; the required modifications are scattered through the implementations of the di#erent components. Their design and implementation is also obscured by code delocalization, as well as by complexities arising from co-ordination and synchronization considerations. We would like to address this problem with solutions that are animated by practical software engineering goals: type safety of scattered changes, and their interactions; explicit design models, with <b>tracability</b> to code; inter-operability with legacy components and binary COTS components; and opportunistic optimization, leveraging any available optimizations existing in the compilers that are in use...|$|E
40|$|Leukemia is {{diagnosed}} with complete blood counts which is by calculating all blood cells {{and compare the}} number of white blood cells (White Blood Cells / WBC) and red blood cells (Red Blood Cells / RBC). Information obtained from a complete blood count, has become a cornerstone in the hematology laboratory for diagnostic purposes and monitoring of hematological disorders. However, the traditional procedure for counting blood cells manually requires effort and a long time, therefore this method {{is one of the}} most expensive routine tests in laboratory hematology clinic. Solution for such kind of time consuming task and necessity of data <b>tracability</b> can be found in image processing techniques based on blood cell morphology. This study aims to identify Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia type M 3 (AML M 3) using Fuzzy Rule Based System based on morphology of white blood cells. Characteristic parameters witch extractedare WBC Area, Nucleus and Granule Ratio of white blood cells. Image processing algorithms such as thresholding, Canny edge detection and color identification filters are used. Then for identification of ALL, AML M 3 and Healthy cells used Fuzzy Rule Based System with Sugeno method.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of Non Functional requirements (NFRs) {{often results in}} scattered code in the whole system, {{because there are no}} modular design and implementation artifacts for NFRs. This thesis proposes to use policies as the design and implementation artifacts for NFRs. Relevant policy mechanisms are surveyed and characterized through a list of attributes. Two policy mechanisms PEOCL and Aspect are proposed to be used for designing and implementing NFRs. PEOCL is extended from Object Constraint Language and is used to represent design- level policies for NFRs. PEOCL policies are further mapped to aspects in AspectJ at the code level. An abstract aspect library is also developed to support this methodology. This methodology is validated and illustrated through a case study. This approach realizes modular design and implementation for NFRs and the decoupling of the design and implementation for NFRs and those for functional features, thus achieves readability, <b>tracability,</b> non-intrusive adaptation, evolvability, and reusability.

40|$|Current {{restrictions}} {{for human}} cell-based therapies have {{been related to}} technological limitations with regards to cellular proliferation capacity, maintenance of differentiated phenotype for primary human cell culture, and transmission of communicable diseases. We have seen that cultured primary fetal cells from one organ donation could possibly meet the exigent and stringent technical aspects for development of therapeutic products. We could develop a master cell bank (MCB) of 50 homogenous ampoules of 4 - 5 million cells each from one fetal organ donation (skin) in {{short periods of time}} compared to other primary cell types. Safety tests were performed at all stages of the cell banking. MCB ampoules could create a working cell bank to be used for clinical or research use. Monolayer culture of fetal skin cells had a life span of 12 - 17 passages, and independent cultures obtained from the same organ donation were consistent for protein concentration (with 1. 4 -fold maximal difference between cultures) as well as gene expression of MMP- 14, MMP- 3, TIMP- 3, and VEGF (1. 4 -, 1. 9 -, 2. 1 -, and 1. 4 -fold maximal difference between cultures, respectively). Cell cultures derived from four independent fetal skin donations were consistent for cell growth, protein concentration, and gene expression of MDK, PTN, TGF-beta 1, and OPG. As it is the intention that banked primary fetal cells can profit from the potential treatment {{of hundreds of thousands of}} patients with only one organ donation, it is imperative to show consistency, <b>tracability,</b> and safety of the process, including donor tissue selection, cell banking, cell testing, and growth of cells in upscaling for the preparation of cell transplantation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{adhesion}} {{strength of a}} ceramic coating deposited through direct spraying on a roughened substrate is a key issue {{in the manufacture of}} high-quality coatings on industrial components. The purpose of this work was to develop a rapid and discerning procedure for establishing adhesion level of a ceramic coating on a metallic substrate. The LAser Shock Adhesion Test, namely LASAT, was successfully applied to ceramic coatings with irradiation impact on the metallic side. Suitable parameters were found to determine the LASAT adhesion threshold using a standard Nd:YAG laser source. With a laser-irradiated area of several millimeters in diameter, it allowed assessment of the coating threshold on several areas of a coated plate sample. A control procedure for a qualitative assessment of coating adhesion was developed. This testing procedure could be easily used in industry, with possible location of the LASAT unit near to the spraying booth, for a direct production control on coated sample to improve the <b>tracability</b> of manufactured parts. Additional work was carried out to investigate a quantitative approach of the LASAT test to ceramic coating. The purpose was to simulate the shock wave propagation with the RADIOSS® code (a 3 D software originally developed for car crash simulation). This code was implemented to calculate the velocity of the material and corresponding pressure throughout the substrate and the coating during the shock wave release (less than 2 ms). Experimental VISAR profiles ('Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector') were monitored in the straight direction of the laser-irradiated area on the rear side. These experimental signals (velocity measures) of the ceramic coating could be fitted and compared with a fairly good agreement with simulated profiles obtained by RADIOSS®. This modelling work was the first step towards a more comprehensive coating {{adhesion strength}} calculation in the future...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{technological}} problems {{physical models}} of complex shapes still are {{of great importance}} e. g. in mould and die production. Two tasks for the metrology of curved surfaces can therefore be specified: {{on the one hand}} an initial CAD data model has to be generated {{on the basis of a}} physical design model and on the other the actual and nominal shape of a complex surface given by measured point data and a CAD data model has to be compared. In order to improve accuracy, speed and <b>tracability</b> of coordinate measuring and to create a tool for research on new measuring strategies the IPA has developed a measuring system for curved surfaces which is integrated within a CIM system. This system will be introduced in this paper and comprises model making, metrology, CAD/CAM, traditional NC manufacturing and rapid prototyping techniques. The presented measuring software package can be an enhancement to any CAD system open for user applications. By this means measuring and construction sessions tak e place within a common software environment and all of the CAD system's capabilities can be used. The software has been adapted to different CAD systems and is able to interact both with tactile coordinate measuring machines (CMM) and optical sensor systems. For digitizing point data are collected on a physical model by scanning and sent to the CAD system, where the IPA software generated an initial surface description. Based on this model a physical representation can be created to the original model. Finally a CAM system generated NC data for three or five axis milling machines. For inspection the system generated a set of nominal points to be measured based on the CAD model of the surface and on selection criterial given by the user. These inspection points are sent to the CMM. The measured actual points are transmitted to the CAD model of the surface and on selection criteria given by the user. These inspection points are sent to the CMM. The measured actual points are transmitte...|$|E
40|$|The Artificial Intelligence {{field of}} Integrating Multiple Learned Models (IMLM) explores {{ways to combine}} results from sets of trained {{programs}}. ^ Aroclor Interpretation is an ill-conditioned problem in which trained programs must operate in scenarios outside their training ranges because it is intractable to train them completely. Consequently, they fail in ways related to the scenarios. ^ We developed a general-purpose IMLM solution, the Combiner, and applied it to Aroclor Interpretation. The Combiner 2 ̆ 7 s first step, Scenario Identification (SI), learns rules from very sparse, synthetic training data consisting of results from a suite of trained programs called Methods. SI produces fuzzy belief weights for each scenario by approximately matching the rules. The Combiner 2 ̆ 7 s second step, Aroclor Presence Detection (AP), classifies each of three Aroclors as present or absent in a sample. The third step, Aroclor Quantification (AQ), produces quantitative values for the concentration of each Aroclor in a sample. AP and AQ use automatically learned empirical biases {{for each of the}} Methods in each scenario. Through fuzzy logic, AP and AQ combine scenario weights, automatically learned biases for each of the Methods in each scenario, and Methods 2 ̆ 7 results to determine results for a sample. ^ The Combiner is a general purpose IMLM solution. Its unique scenario-based architecture provides a clean method of including application-specific knowledge from human experts. Once scenario elements are defined, all rule sets are automatically learned. ^ The Combiner is a powerful logic tool for evidence accrual. It solves the 2 ̆ 2 chicken-and-egg 2 ̆ 2 dilemma caused when relying on scenario-dependent programs to determine the scenario for a sample. It handles heterogeneous inputs and delivers heterogeneous outputs. ^ Because of its straightforward approach, the rules and reasons the Combiner reaches its conclusions are easily available for accountability and <b>tracability.</b> Scenario weights are never explicitly needed by an operator, but are available and deliver a wealth of additional information about the real-world conditions affecting a sample. ^ This dissertation documents the Combiner and its superior performance against Multicategory Classification, Dempster-Shafer, and the best Method in the Aroclor Interpretation suite. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} targets of a DSS for the Plant Protection Service are: - To satisfy the grower {{to give the}} best and more precise advice to control late blight - To answer at the {{missions}} of the Service: to know {{the evolution of the}} pathogens in the fields and around to inform the growers on the evolutions of the rules I Give the more precise advice at the best moment The first think is to determine the risk of the disease: At the moment two models Guntz-Divoux and Milsol are running and use the data of a network of meteorological stations which are checked every day by phone. If the models are very useful the scouting in field is indispensable. When the risk is known and forecasted, it is necessary to know the susceptibility of the potato cultivar to advise a spray or not. The grower want to have information to choose the fungicide. Three criteria are retained: the pressure of the disease and the symptoms in the area, the stage of the crop, the practices of the grower. There is a big interest: The grower has to observe his fields and all around, he has to take an account the risk and indicate his practices. It is necessary to notice that some regulation information are given (example: maximum of number of sprays for the fungicide). The date of treatment, how to give the information? The criteria are the epidemiologic risk and the state of the crop: protected or not and the previous indications. There are two methods: - Advice at the moment (SMS), the grower has to by ready. - Advice in advance (one the three next days), so it is necessary to introduce the weather forecast (for the three next days) every day. II The missions of the plant protection service All the information of the stage of the crops, the late blight, some information of other enemies indicated by the grower are collected by the Plant Protection Service. There is a big question about the collect of the data: The grower agrees to give the information on the disease but he is careful to give his practices, these one have to be confidential. In other hand he want to introduce automatically these information in others proceedings of <b>traçability.</b> We build a new tool with the "Arvalis Insitut du Vegetal" to reach these targets with the will to have permanent exchanges with the growers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E
