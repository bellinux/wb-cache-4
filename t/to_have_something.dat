5|$|Kijak {{revealed}} that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelgängers he {{was reminded of}} an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his public persona and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> deeper than the average rockumentary. He {{said one of the}} hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> {{to do with a}} plan to rob a major bank.|$|E

5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Artists {{like the}} Carter Family, Robert Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Clarence Ashley, Buell Kazee, Uncle Dave Macon, Mississippi John Hurt, and the Stanley Brothers, {{as well as}} Jimmie Rodgers, the Reverend Gary Davis, and Bill Monroe came <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> more than a {{regional}} or ethnic reputation. The revival turned up a tremendous wealth and diversity of music and put it out through radio shows and record stores.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally the attire of the Igbo {{generally}} {{consisted of}} little clothing as {{the purpose of}} clothing then was to conceal private parts, although elders were fully clothed. Children were usually nude from birth till their adolescence (the {{time when they were}} considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to hide) but sometimes ornaments such as beads were worn around the waist for medical reasons. Uli body art was also used to decorate both {{men and women in the}} form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.|$|E

25|$|According to Yuji Horii, {{he wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> the player went around {{collecting}} {{as the previous}} Dragon Quest games had crests and orbs respectively. However, {{he did not want}} to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game. The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist Akira Toriyama, whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{appearing}} in Tekken 7s original arcade release, Nina returns in its updated title, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. In the story mode, {{she was forced}} to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to concern about Lars' good reason on keeping Jin safe with him, deeming it very interesting to watch and resign from Zaibatsu, faking her death while setting her private assassination job for hire. She is later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding... posing as the bride. During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found vaguely familiar, who happens to be her son, Steve Fox. Steve wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> he wanted to say to her... Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.|$|E

500|$|Andy Orchard {{comments}} that the seeming appearance of Baldr with Volla in the Merseburg Incantation is [...] "intriguing" [...] since Fulla {{is one of}} the three goddesses (the other two being Baldr's mother Frigg and his wife Nanna) the deceased Baldr expressly sends gifts to from Hel. John Lindow says that since the name Fulla seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to do with fullness, it may also point to an association with fertility.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year Hawke again received critical acclaim, {{this time for}} his performance in Richard Linklater's 1995 drama Before Sunrise. The film follows a young American (Hawke) and a young French woman (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another. The San Francisco Chronicle praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: [...] " [...] interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> personal at stake in their performances." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It adapts {{with the}} show, I {{think in the}} context of a live show it's {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> that lives and breathes with the show. One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever we decide to do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E

500|$|In debut {{footage of}} Street Fighter V, Mika is seen {{slapping}} her buttocks {{as part of}} her Critical Art attack. The decision not to show the animation in the North American version of the game was a subject of controversy, leading to a petition to restore it. According to producer Yoshinori Ono regarding not showing her butt slap, [...] "Those changes came up internally. We decided to remove that because we want the biggest possible number of people to play, and we don’t want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> in the game that might make someone uncomfortable." [...] Some other shots, including the entrance animation for Cammy, were also replaced.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the midtempo piece [...] "I Just Want <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Something</b> to Do", which {{contains}} lyrics pertaining to ambivalence and anomie.

The next track, [...] "I Wanted Everything", {{is compared to}} Merle Haggard's song [...] "If We Make It Through December", being called its [...] "punk counterpart" [...] by Rock: A Canadian Perspective author Larry Starr. [...] "Questioningly" [...] is a ballad focusing on failing relationships and heartbreak. [...] "Don't Come Close" [...] uses elements which can also be heard in country music, such as twang.|$|E

Temime spoke about the dress, saying that she [...] "wanted it to be a witch wedding dress but not a Halloween dress. The dress is white but it needed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> fantastic to it.
