40|$|Recent {{research}} has revealed {{individual differences in}} {{the extent to which}} people base <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> on affect and cognition. Two studies are presented that assess whether such differences predict the strength of individuals' intention-behaviour relationships. Participants completed measures of affect, cognition, intention, and behaviour regarding a range of health behaviours. Study 1 (N = 300) found that the strength of the intention-behaviour relationship was significantly related {{to the extent to which}} individuals based <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> on affect, but not to the extent they based them on cognition. Study 2 (N = 387) replicated the findings of the first study. In addition, Study 2 revealed that intention stability mediated the relationship between the degree people based <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> on affect and the strength of the intention-behaviour relationship. Thus, individuals who base <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> strongly on affect have more stable intentions, and are therefore more likely to enact them. © 2013 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

5|$|Due to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the {{international}} governing body of football, that domestic leagues {{reduce the number}} of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.

5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in <b>their</b> <b>intention</b> to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008.
