25|$|In 2008, Robert Metcalfe, {{one of the}} co-inventors of Ethernet, said he {{believed}} commercial applications using <b>Terabit</b> Ethernet may occur by 2015, though it might require new Ethernet standards. It was predicted this would be followed rapidly by a scaling to 100 <b>Terabit,</b> possibly as early as 2020. It {{is worth noting that}} these were theoretical predictions of technological ability, rather than estimates of when such speeds would actually become available at a practical price point.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Thierry Georges and {{his team}} at France Télécom R Centre, {{combining}} optical solitons of different wavelengths (wavelength division multiplexing), demonstrated a data transmission of 1 <b>terabit</b> per second (1,000,000,000,000 units of information per second).|$|E
500|$|Juniper's first {{enterprise}} switch {{product was}} the EX 4200, which {{was released in}} 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were [...] "newer and less robust" [...] than {{other aspects of the}} product. Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 <b>Terabit</b> router in 2010. In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers. In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released. Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.|$|E

5000|$|As of 2007, Seagate {{believed}} it could produce 300 <b>terabit</b> (37.5 terabyte) Hard disk drives using HAMR technology.

Researchers Robert Maher, Alex Alvarado, Domaniç Lavery & Polina Bayvel of University College London were able to increase networking speeds to 1.125 <b>Terabits</b> per second. Christos Santis, graduate student Scott Steger, Amnon Yariv, Martin and Eileen Summerfield developed a new laser that quadruples transfer speeds over fiber optic cabling.
