25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E
25|$|Pain and {{discomfort}} also increase aggression. Even <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of placing one's hands {{in hot water}} can cause an aggressive response. Hot temperatures have been implicated {{as a factor in}} a number of studies. One study completed {{in the midst of the}} civil rights movement found that riots were more likely on hotter days than cooler ones (Carlsmith & Anderson 1979). Students were found to be more aggressive and irritable after taking a test in a hot classroom (Anderson et al. 1996, Rule, et al. 1987). Drivers in cars without air conditioning were also found to be more likely to honk their horns (Kenrick & MacFarlane 1986), which is used as a measure of aggression and has shown links to other factors such as generic symbols of aggression or the visibility of other drivers.|$|E

2500|$|In a French {{television}} {{debate in}} 2003 with Nicolas Sarkozy, Sarkozy accused Ramadan of defending the stoning of adulterers, a punishment supposedly warranted by {{a section of}} the Islamic penal code known as hudud. Ramadan replied that Sarkozy was wrong. He said that he opposed corporal punishments, stoning and the death penalty and that he is in favor of a moratorium on these practices to open the debate among Islamic scholars in Muslim-majority countries that enforce them. Many people, including Sarkozy, were outraged. Ramadan later defended his position arguing that, because it involved religious texts that Muslims take seriously, the law would have to be properly understood and contextualized. Ramadan argued that in Muslim countries, <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> to [...] "condemn" [...] won't change anything, but with a moratorium, it could open the way for further debate. He thinks that such a debate can only lead to an abolition of these rules.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the results}} of social and {{economic}} progress among the upper paleolithic social groups was the need to communicate with each other. A complicated knowledge about the natural environment and social relations was handed down verbally, in iconographic representations and symbolic signs. This mode of communication in the past was possible owing to the so called "magic culture" where the functional and the technical, the cultural and the communicational and the sphere of worldview were related. It means that even <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>acts</b> were performed according to ritual patterns. From this perspective the paleolithic anthropomorphic figures can be analyzed in three complementary spheres: technical and functional, cultural and communicational as well as worldview...|$|R

These include Reporting, Responding, Relating, Reasoning, and Reconstructing. This framework indicates that {{the complexity of the}} writing (and indeed of thought) increases as the writer moves through the levels, beginning with <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>act</b> of recording an event/description and building towards a product that includes an application of some critical thought. Though the criteria establishing what makes a piece of writing (in this instance, a blog) “reflective” according to these scholars differ slightly, the similarities amongst them include deepening understanding of the self and the broader world by relying on both subjective and objective information.|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, {{issued a}} {{religious}} edict prohibiting contact and cooperation with foreign media outlets because they seek [...] to [...] "spread chaos and strife in Muslim lands." [...] He added that contacting foreign media outlets to [...] "divulge the country’s secrets or address various matters" [...] was tantamount to [...] "treason and major crime." [...] He said that [...] "It is not permissible {{and is considered}} betrayal and assistance to the enemies of Islam." [...] Also, [...] "A believer has to help keeping security, that of his nation and community, and protecting his religion." [...] This fatwa is vague and itself {{is in need of}} another explanatory fatwa. Foreign media appears to have been singled out because it is mostly free and does not conform to Saudi Arabian government censorship. The fatwa uses the extremely strong terms (i.e., [...] "haram" [...] or unlawful, [...] "treason," [...] "betrayal," [...] and [...] "major crime") for <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of contacting the press. This fatwa has the potential to endanger the lives of ordinary citizens and members of the media due to the connotation of its language and overall ambiguity. It also threatens the financial interests of legitimate global business. In democratic societies, journalism and the media play an indispensable role in educating the public and combating corruption.|$|E
2500|$|The Hail Mary is the {{essential}} element of the Rosary, a prayer method in use especially among Roman Rite (Western) Catholics. [...] The Eastern Catholic Churches say a similar version. The Rosary consists traditionally of three sets of five Mysteries, each mystery consisting of one [...] "decade" [...] or ten Ave Marias. The 150 Ave Marias of the Rosary thus echo the 150 psalms. These meditate upon events of Jesus' life during his childhood (Joyful Mysteries), Passion (Sorrowful Mysteries), and from his Resurrection onwards (Glorious Mysteries). Another set, the Luminous Mysteries, is of comparatively recent origin, having been proposed by Pope John Paul II in 2002. Each of these Mysteries is prayed as a decade (a unit of ten), consisting of one Our Father (Pater Noster or The Lord's Prayer), ten Hail Marys, and one 'Glory Be' (Gloria Patri) (Doxology).The repetition of the [...] "Our Father," [...] "Hail Mary," [...] and [...] "Glory Be" [...] is conducive to meditation, as several Popes have pointed out, especially Pope Leo XIII. The restatement of the prayers locks one into fixed language, having the effect of freeing the conscious mind so that the recitation may come more from the heart and not the head. During the apparitions at Fatima, Mary placed singular emphasis {{on the importance of}} praying the Rosary every day to bring the world to conversion. Pope Paul V said that [...] "the Rosary is a treasure of graces" [...] and Sister Lúcia of Fátima explained [...] "the Rosary helps to preserve that flickering flame of faith that has not yet been completely extinguished from many consciences. Even for those souls who pray without meditating, <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of taking the beads in hand to pray is already a remembrance of God - of the supernatural". Lúcia also said [...] "there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families, of the families in the world, or of the religious communities, or even of the life of peoples and nations that cannot be solved by the Rosary".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the court's decision, CCNV {{successfully}} staged its demonstration, including sleeping, for approximately seven weeks during the winter of that year. Sometime later the National Park Service revised its camping regulations for the National Capital Region. The new regulations stated:"when it reasonably appears, in light of all the circumstances, that the participants, in conducting these activities, are in fact using the area as a living accommodation regardless of the intent of the participants or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be engaging."CCNV planned to hold another demonstration the following winter and was to include 60 tents total with 20 tents in a quadrant of Lafayette Park and 40 tents on the National Mall The CCNV filed on September 7, 1982 for a permit. The National Park Service granted a permit [...] "to set up two symbolic campsites, one on the Mall with a maximum of one hundred participants and forty tents, and one in Lafayette Park with approximately fifty participants and twenty tents". The permit granted the ability to have a twenty-four-hour presence at the locations but did not allow the participants to sleep. The CCNV then sought a court order invalidating the permit's limitation on sleeping as an unconstitutional restriction on their freedom of expression. They argued that part of the core message the demonstrators wished to convey was that homeless people have no permanent place to sleep. The District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the National Park Service. The Court ruled that:(1) CCNV's demonstration falls within the scope of the amended anti-camping regulations; (2) sleeping, within the context of CCNV's demonstration, falls outside the scope of the first amendment; and (3) even assuming first amendment scrutiny is required, the new anti-camping regulations are constitutional as applied to CCNV's proposed sleeping activities. The group appealed to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals where their case was heard. The Appeals Court re-examined the three reasons the District Court did not grant the CCNV injunction. They agreed with the notion that the National Park Service's regulation fit the CCNV's demonstration. Concerning the claim that [...] "CCNV's demonstration, falls outside the scope of the first amendment" [...] the court wrote in the opinion:Indeed, we cannot understand how the government can deny the indicia of political expression that permeate CCNV's pointed use of <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of sleeping. The protestors choose to sleep, purposely across from the White House and Capitol grounds, in sparsely appointed tents which the Park Service has already designated as undeniably [...] "symbolic." [...] Their permit application states that this conduct is intended to send the same message as this court recognized was sent in CCNV's 1981-82 demonstration: that the problems of the homeless will not simply disappear into the night. In concern with the Lower Courts third assertion that the new anti-camping regulations are constitutional the Appeals Court wrote and summarized their ruling:In sum, the Park Service has failed to demonstrate that the government's interests will be furthered by keeping these putative protestors from the sleeping activity which is the sole point in dispute. We reverse, therefore, because the indiscriminate line the government seeks to draw against sleeping cannot pass first amendment muster. Accordingly, we grant CCNV the injunctive relief it seeks, enjoining the Park Service from prohibiting sleep at CCNV's demonstration.|$|E
