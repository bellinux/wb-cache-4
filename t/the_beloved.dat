2500|$|The {{structure}} of Sonnet 32 {{can be interpreted}} in light of its relationship to time. [...] "The exact match created between events as foreseen by the poet (his death, the increasing poetic sophistication of the age and consequently of <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> taste) and <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> conjectured thought as he rereads the poet's verse makes intelligible Shakespeare's choice of a {{structure of}} superposition (in which lines 9-14 [...] repeat lines 3-8 [...] )." ...|$|R

5|$|For a {{short time}} in 1901 Olivia held a {{position}} as a book reviewer for The Kensington Review, a small literary magazine, until it succumbed to poor sales. After, she dabbled in the occult and became friendly with prominent London occultists. In 1902 she co-wrote with Florence Farr — who for a time led the Order of Golden Dawn — two plays on the occult, <b>The</b> <b>Beloved</b> of Hathor and The Shrine of the Golden Hawk, which were subsequently published as a pair.|$|E
5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and <b>the</b> <b>beloved</b> disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of death is}} felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, a symbol of <b>the</b> <b>beloved,</b> sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless {{plays a significant role}} in the action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20).|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of how well {{we need to be}} known, to be loved, is considered. A ‘second-person’ model is argued for, on which love requires that <b>the</b> <b>beloved’s</b> demands to be known be respected. This puts pressure on the idea that lovers need to make a beloved’s interests their own, taking that to require comprehension of <b>the</b> <b>beloved’s</b> interests: a lover would have to appreciate the normative intelligibility and motivating force of an interest. The possibility of love with failure of comprehension is defended, using illustrations from Marilynne Robinson’s novel Gilead...|$|R

25|$|Mark's account (which in the {{earliest}} extant manuscripts) ends abruptly and claims that the women told no one. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark do not present any further involvement at the tomb. Luke describes Peter as running to the tomb to check for himself, and John adds that <b>the</b> <b>Beloved</b> Disciple did so too, <b>the</b> <b>beloved</b> disciple outrunning Peter.|$|E

50|$|The envoi first {{appears in}} the songs of the medieval trouvères and troubadours; it {{developed}} as an address to <b>the</b> poet's <b>beloved</b> or to a friend or patron. As such, the envoi {{can be viewed as}} standing apart from the poem itself and expresses the poet's hope that the poem may bring them some benefit (<b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> favours, increased patronage, and so on).|$|R
40|$|People loved {{for their}} beauty and cheerfulness are not loved as irreplaceable, yet people loved for “what their souls are made of” are. Or so {{literary}} romance implies; leading philosophical accounts, however, deny the distinction, holding that reasons for love either {{do not exist}} or do not include <b>the</b> <b>beloved’s</b> distinguishing features. In this, I argue, they deny an essential species of love. To account for it while preserving <b>the</b> <b>beloved’s</b> irreplaceability, I defend a model of agency on which people can love each other for identities still being created, through a kind of mutual improvisatio...|$|R

2500|$|Similar to the Petrarchan sonnet writers, Shakespeare begins Sonnet 1 {{with the}} exaltation of <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> {{physical}} beauty, before changing to {{a tone of}} contempt for <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> lack of a desire for an heir. However, according to Robert Matz, [...] "Sonnet 1 is {{so far from the}} romantic desires we usually associate with sonnets that no woman is even mentioned in it... But while there is no woman in this sonnet it is not the case that there is no desire. On the contrary, Shakespeare continually expresses his desire for the young man whom he calls 'beauty's rose' and who, he warns, must like a rose reproduce himself". The allusion to the rose is a particularly significant because it was uncommon for the rose, a symbol for femininity, to be used to refer to a man. At {{the end of the first}} quatrain, Shakespeare's pun on the word [...] "tender" [...] (to mean both the obvious meaning of youth and beauty and the less obvious sense of currency to alleviate a debt) further illustrates <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> need to reproduce in order to pay off his debt of chastity.|$|R

2500|$|Following George Wyndham, John Bernard {{notes the}} neoplatonic {{underpinnings}} of the poem, which derive ultimately from Petrarch: <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> transcendent beauty is variously diffused through the natural world, but is purer at its source. The reference to Adonis has led numerous scholars, among them Georg Gottfried Gervinus, to explore connections to Venus and Adonis; Gerald Massey {{notes that the}} twinned references to Adonis and Helen underscore the sense of <b>the</b> <b>beloved's</b> androgyny, most famously delineated in Sonnet 20. Hermann Isaac notes that the first quatrain resembles a sonnet by Tasso. In support of his hypothesis that the person addressed in the sonnet was an actor, Oscar Wilde hypothesized that the poem's [...] "shadows" [...] refer to the young man's roles.|$|R
