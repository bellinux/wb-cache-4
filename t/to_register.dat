5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} <b>to</b> <b>register</b> voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities {{the right to vote}} by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing <b>to</b> <b>register</b> qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E

5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new voters <b>to</b> <b>register</b> {{and for those}} who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends <b>to</b> <b>register</b> at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed <b>to</b> <b>register</b> to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This increased the number of registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson <b>to</b> <b>register</b> the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife <b>to</b> <b>register</b> a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and <b>to</b> <b>register</b> claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E
