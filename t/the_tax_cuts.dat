40|$|The {{centerpiece}} of President Bush's <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in 2003 {{was a sharp}} reduction in <b>the</b> individual dividend <b>tax</b> rate. <b>The</b> dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> was designed to spur investment and boost the stock market by increasing the after-tax return on corporate earnings, thus raising stock valuations. <b>The</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> also reduced <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> bias against dividends to spur larger payouts to shareholders.

This study examines the impact of <b>the</b> dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> after one year.
