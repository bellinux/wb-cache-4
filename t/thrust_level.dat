40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} air traffic on {{the upper and lower}} troposphere, one must find an effective remote sensing method to measure the actual gas emissions of aircraft engines at defined <b>thrust</b> <b>levels</b> at all altitudes. FTIR-Emission-Spectroscopy seems to fulfil these needs by detecting the thermal radiation of the hot exhaust gases, yielding all information about their compounds during one measurement. Several ground-based engine types at different <b>thrust</b> <b>levels</b> have been analysed; e. g. old engines, JT 8 - and modern CFM 56 -bypass engines. The IR features have been used to determine the gas temperature and the total number of H 2 O, CO 2, CO, and NO molecules behind the nozzle at different <b>thrust</b> <b>levels.</b> Formaldehyde and other hydrocarbon species have been identified but could not yet be quantified. With respect to the axial temperature distribution, a multi-layer model is used to calculate the radiative transfer through the downstream slices of the cooling plume. Knowing the plume dia meter, the fuel consumption and the mass flow of gas at the exit, one can obtain the emission rates and indices for different <b>thrust</b> <b>levels.</b> Once fully developed for passive ground measurements, the system can easily work under flight conditions. Apart from future applications for the turbine development and the engine-status control after a certain flight time, this remote sensing system can deliver emission data from aircraft at all altitudes...|$|R

50|$|The NASA {{presentation}} {{shows that}} the HLV has limited growth options to take more payloads into space. While 5-segment SRBs {{can be used on}} the vehicle, they will require significant re-engineering of the vehicle and will only yield 7 metric tons more to lower Earth orbit. Other growth options include an upgrade of the SSME to 106% or 109% <b>thrust</b> <b>level</b> and a switch from the J2-x upper engine to an air-startable SSME.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard General Electric J79 jet engine, a Rocketdyne AR2-3 rocket engine was fitted {{at the base of}} the vertical fin. This engine burned a mixture of JP-4 jet fuel and 90% hydrogen peroxide oxidizer solution. The NF-104 carried enough oxidizer for approximately 100 seconds of rocket engine operation. The <b>thrust</b> <b>level</b> could be adjusted to maximum or approximately half power by the pilot using an additional throttle lever on the left side of the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of technology and machining methods, considerable attention has been focused in manufacturing micro thrusters for micro spacecraft applications (Yetter et al, 2003). Micro propulsion systems are currently being investigated for Miniature Kill Vehicles (MKV) and Micro Satellite Systems (MSS) with an emphasis in reducing weight and cost but without affecting performance. Reducing the weight seems practical when reducing {{the size of the}} propulsion system, but problems are encountered with system design. ^ In addition, propulsion requirements strongly influence choice in propellant and complexity. A thorough understanding of stabilizing <b>thrust</b> <b>levels</b> and the ability to control the propulsion system is important {{in order to meet the}} requirements of the specific propulsion application. Certain applications might require long thrust durations, while others require small thrust pulses. Choice in propellant can influence hardware selection needed to achieve reliable <b>thrust</b> <b>levels.</b> Various micro propulsion systems have be proposed but only a few have been investigated. ^ This paper investigates the pulsing characteristics of a mN Bi-propellant thruster for small spacecraft applications. The thruster was completely design to have its own pressure and valve control system in order to control <b>thrust</b> <b>levels</b> and pulse lengths. The propellants tested where gaseous Methane/Oxygen and Hydrogen/Oxygen which allowed the system be simple.

50|$|Based on {{data from}} VX-100 testing, it was {{expected}} that the VX-200 engine would have a system efficiency of 60-65% and <b>thrust</b> <b>level</b> of 5 N. Optimal specific impulse appeared to be around 5,000s using low cost argon propellant. One of the remaining untested issues was potential vs actual thrust—whether the hot plasma actually detached from the rocket. Another issue was waste heat management. About 60% of input energy became useful kinetic energy. Much of the remaining 40% is secondary ionizations from plasma crossing magnetic field lines and exhaust divergence. A significant portion of that 40% was waste heat (see energy conversion efficiency). Managing and rejecting that waste heat is critical.|$|E
50|$|For {{the true}} 'seat of the pants' feeling, however, the {{simplest}} designs had no {{attitude control system}} at all. Instead the pilot would stand during the flight, and simply lean backwards, forwards or side-to-side to move {{the center of gravity}} relative to the center of thrust of the fixed engine. As a result the offset thrust would cause the LESS to rotate until the astronaut returned to a neutral position and the center of gravity was again aligned with the engine thrust. Ultimately, however, this was considered to be less desirable than hardware control, particularly as it imposed significant constraints on vehicle <b>thrust</b> <b>level</b> and inertia... adding gimballing or relative engine throttling might actually simplify the design.|$|E
50|$|SpaceX {{characterized}} the test flight as a success, having flight proven over 95% of Falcon 1's systems. Their primary objectives for this launch were to test responsive launch procedures and gather data. The SpaceX team planned both a diagnosis and solution vetted by third party experts, {{believing that the}} slosh issue could be corrected by adding baffles to the second stage LOX tank and adjusting the control logic. Furthermore, the Merlin shutdown transient was {{to be addressed by}} initiating shutdown at a much lower <b>thrust</b> <b>level,</b> albeit at some risk to engine reusability. The SpaceX team wished to work on the problem to avoid a recurrence as they changed over into the operational phase for Falcon 1.|$|E

For the NERVA {{replacement}} considered above, this fuel flow would be 121 kg/s. The mass of hydrogen is {{much lower than the}} hydrogen/oxygen mix in the J-2, where only about 1/6 of the mass is hydrogen. Since liquid hydrogen has a density of about 70 kg/m³, this represents a flow of about 1,725 litres per second, about three times that of the J-2. This requires additional plumbing but {{is by no means a}} serious problem; the famed F-1 had flow rates on the order of 2,500 l/s.|$|E

Funding of $1 million was provided in the FY 2004 Defense Appropriations Act to develop a prototype of the low-cost engine for the vehicle. The engine would provide 400,000 pounds-force (1.8 MN) of thrust using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as propellants. For the engine development, Space Systems/Loral is partnered with Aerojet, ORBITEC and Microcosm, {{under the auspices of the}} Air Force Research Laboratory and was completed in 2006.

5000|$|Throttling of {{a rocket}} engine means varying the <b>thrust</b> <b>level</b> in-flight. This {{is not always}} a requirement; in fact, the thrust of a solid-fuel rocket is not {{controllable}} after ignition. However, liquid-propellant rockets can be throttled by means of valves which regulate the flow of fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber. Hybrid rocket engines, such as the one used in Space Ship One, use solid fuel with a liquid oxidizer, and therefore can be throttled. Throttling tends to be required more for powered landings, and launch into space using a single main stage (such as the Space Shuttle), than for launch with multistage rockets. They are also useful in situations where the airspeed of the vehicle must be limited due to aerodynamic stress in the denser atmosphere at lower levels (i.e. the Space Shuttle) ...|$|E
