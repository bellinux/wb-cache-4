The formula is easily extended to any number of series coils with mutual coupling. The method can be used to find the self-inductance of large coils of wire of any cross-sectional shape by computing the sum of the mutual inductance of each <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in the coil with every other turn since in such a coil all turns are in series.|$|E
40|$|For most of us, {{discoveries in}} the art arerare. My books {{reviewed}} the contribu-tions of many engineers and contained {{a limited number of}} original ideas. I recall many excited moments during my career that faded upon the realization that a “discovery ” was actually a measurement error, misunderstand-ing or rediscovery. In 1997, an engineer requested that I exam-ine his measured data for an inductor. The data was unexpected, so I decided to measure a sim-ple solenoid with a network analyzer. The ana-lyzer display stunned me. This moment of excitement would not fade. The industry’s accepted and century-old inductor model was wrong. Why had no engineer before me per-formed this simple experiment and written about it? The significance of the experiment began to unfold at my desk as I examined the problem mathematically. As is often the case, new knowledge is both satisfying and useful. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe new fil-ter and oscillator structures suggested by the new model. First, I will review the historic inductor model, then the new one. The historic model One need only ponder a solenoid inductor to realize that the close spaced turns are capaci-tively coupled. But how do you measure capaci-tance that is shorted by a <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire?</b> Webster [12] solved this problem by building a parallel-resonant mode oscillator using an inductor and its self-capacitance. Knowing the inductance (measured at low frequency) and the oscillating frequency, you may deduce the capacitance. From this capacitance, and series resistance from the wire loss, the model of the inductor given in Figure 1 (a) was born. The transmission amplitude and phase versus frequency of this model that is simulated from the schematic and computed by the GENESYS [2] software pro-gram is given in Figure 1 (b). Numerous attempts at mathematically solv-ing the self-capacitance failed. Medhurst [6...|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1830, US {{scientist}} Joseph Henry systematically {{improved and}} popularized the electromagnet. [...] By using wire insulated by silk thread, and inspired by Schweigger's use <b>of</b> multiple <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> {{to make a}} galvanometer, {{he was able to}} wind multiple layers <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on cores, creating powerful magnets with thousands <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> including one that could support 2063 lb. The first major use for electromagnets was in telegraph sounders.|$|R

5000|$|An {{electric}} current flowing in a wire creates {{a magnetic field}} around the wire, due to Ampere's law (see drawing below). To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a coil with many <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> lying side by side. The magnetic field <b>of</b> all the <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> passes {{through the center of}} the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there. A coil forming the shape of a straight tube (a helix) is called a solenoid.|$|R
5000|$|... where N is {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> (for a simple loop this is 1) and ΦB is the {{magnetic}} flux in webers through a single loop.|$|R
50|$|The <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in {{proximity}} {{to each other}} have an equivalent self-capacitance that, when added to any cable capacitance present, resonates with the inductance of the winding. This resonance can accentuate certain frequencies, giving the pickup a characteristic tonal quality. The more <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in the winding, the higher the output voltage but the lower this resonance frequency. The inductive source impedance inherent {{in this type of}} transducer makes it less linear than other forms of pickups, such as piezo-electric or optical. The tonal quality produced by this nonlinearity is, however, subject to taste, and some guitarists and luthiers consider it aesthetically superior to a more linear transducer.|$|R
5000|$|The winding is made <b>of</b> two {{separate}} <b>wires</b> wound in opposing directions along an insulating form and {{connected in parallel}} at the ends. Since there are the same number <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in either direction, the magnetic fields <b>of</b> the two <b>wires</b> cancel each other out, so the coil has little inductance; and since adjacent <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>wires</b> are at approximately the same voltage, there is little parasitic capacitance between the turns.|$|R

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{was that}} the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Experimenters found that using multiple <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in a coil could produce higher, more useful voltages. Since the output voltage {{is proportional to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>turns,</b> generators could be easily designed to produce any desired voltage by varying the number <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> <b>Wire</b> windings became a basic feature of all subsequent generator designs.|$|R
5000|$|See {{schematic}} diagram. An {{induction coil}} {{consists of two}} coils <b>of</b> insulated copper <b>wire</b> wound around a common iron core (M). [...] One coil, called the primary winding (P), is made from relatively few (tens or hundreds) <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> coarse <b>wire.</b> [...] The other coil, the secondary winding, (S) typically consists <b>of</b> many (thousands) <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> fine <b>wire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A current {{through any}} {{conductor}} creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to Ampere's law. [...] The advantage {{of using the}} coil shape is that it increases the strength of magnetic field produced by a given current. The magnetic fields generated by the separate <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> all pass {{through the center of}} the coil and add (superpose) to produce a strong field there. [...] The more <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> the stronger the field produced. Conversely, a changing external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to Faraday's law of induction. [...] The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil, because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.|$|R
50|$|These {{are used}} for high {{frequency}} work. The lack of a core means very low inductance. All current excites current and induces secondary voltage which {{is proportional to the}} mutual inductance. Such transformers may be nothing more than a few <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> soldered onto a printed circuit board.|$|R
50|$|Parasitic {{capacitance}} is {{the consequence}} <b>of</b> parallel <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> acting as capacitor plates, storing charge between adjacent wires. The parasitic capacitance {{can cause the}} coil to become self-resonant at one or several frequencies, which interferes with the intended tuned resonance and blocks and reflects current at the self-resonant frequency.|$|R

The ratio of primary coil windings against secondary coil windings is 1 : 3. The capacity of choke transformers is 3 KVA, and {{the resistance of}} primary and secondary coils is R 1  = R 2  =  0.2 Ω. According to the main technical indicators of 25  Hz phase-sensitive track circuit: {{when there is no}} train on rails, the effective voltage of the terminal of track coil relay (WXJ- 25) shall not be less than 15  V, and when the effective voltage falls to 9  V, the contact of the track relay will fall down. The operating current of track relay is 0.039 A.|$|R

The post has room for three such connections, although usually {{only one or two}} are needed. This permits manual wire-wrapping to be used for repairs.|$|R
50|$|SMT {{inductors}} {{with larger}} inductance values often have <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> or flat strap {{around the body}} or embedded in clear epoxy, allowing the wire or strap to be seen.

50|$|Current {{transformers}} {{are often}} constructed by passing a single primary turn (either an insulated cable or an uninsulated bus bar) through a well-insulated toroidal core wrapped with many <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> This affords easy implementation on high voltage bushings of grid transformers {{and other devices}} by installing the secondary turn core inside high-voltage bushing insulators and using the pass-through conductor as a single turn primary.|$|R
5000|$|In later Oudin {{circuits}} the coils were magnetically coupled, {{forming an}} autotransformer, so the primary induces an EMF {{in the secondary}} by electromagnetic induction. Both coils were usually wound on the same coil form, the primary consisting <b>of</b> relatively few <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>wire</b> at the bottom with an adjustable tap, connected to the secondary winding, made <b>of</b> many <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> fine <b>wire.</b> [...] Oudin found this circuit produced higher voltages due to the large <b>turns</b> ratio <b>of</b> the transformer.|$|R

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{was that}} the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux.

50|$|An {{electromagnet}} {{is a type}} of magnet {{in which}} the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of a large number <b>of</b> closely spaced <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> that create the magnetic field. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers etch spiral {{patterns}} on {{a printed circuit}} board to form the [...] "windings" [...] of a planar transformer, replacing the <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> used to make other types. Some planar transformers are commercially sold as discrete components. Other planar transformers are one of many components on {{a printed circuit board}}. A planar transformer can be thinner than other transformers, which is useful for low-profile applications or when several printed circuit boards are stacked. Almost all planar transformers use a ferrite planar core.|$|R
50|$|This {{ignition}} system uses an ignition coil wound as an autotransformer {{to step up}} the voltage from the 12 volts supplied by the battery (itself supplied, once the engine starts, by the alternator or dynamo in older vehicles). When the points close, current flows through the primary (input) side of the coil, which has a few hundred <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> creating a magnetic field. When the points open, interrupting the current, this field collapses and as it does the lines of flux cut across the secondary (output) coil which has several thousand <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> very fine <b>wire,</b> inducing an open-circuit voltage {{in the range of}} 15 to 30 thousand volts at the coil output terminal.

5000|$|AM {{broadcast}} radios (and {{other consumer}} low frequency receivers) typically use small loop antennas;, a variable capacitor connected across the loop forms a tuned circuit that also tunes the receivers input stage as that capacitor tracks the main tuning. A multiband receiver may contain tap {{points along the}} loop winding in order to tune the loop antenna at widely different frequencies. In older AM radios, the antenna might consist <b>of</b> dozens <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> mounted on {{the back wall of}} the radio (a frame antenna).|$|R

50|$|Influenced by William Sturgeon and Michael Faraday, Callan {{began work}} {{on the idea of}} the {{induction}} coil in 1834. He invented the first induction coil in 1836. An induction coil produces an intermittent high-voltage alternating current from a low-voltage direct current supply. It has a primary coil consisting <b>of</b> a few <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> thick <b>wire</b> wound around an iron core and subjected to a low voltage (usually from a battery). Wound on top of this is a secondary coil made up <b>of</b> many <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>wire.</b> An iron armature and make-and-break mechanism repeatedly interrupts the current to the primary coil, producing a high-voltage, rapidly alternating current in the secondary circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relation}} between electric current, magnetic fields and physical forces was first noted by Hans Christian Ørsted who, in 1820, observed a compass needle was deflected from pointing North when a current flowed in an adjacent wire. The tangent galvanometer {{was used to}} measure currents using this effect, where the restoring force returning the pointer to the zero position was provided by the Earth's magnetic field. This made these instruments usable only when aligned with the Earth's field. Sensitivity of the instrument was increased by using additional <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> to multiply the effect - the instruments were called [...] "multipliers".|$|R
40|$|Impedance {{method has}} been {{explored}} for damage detection and identification. Typically, when the impedance sensor is integrated onto the mechanical structure to be monitored, its electrical impedance {{is directly related}} to the mechanical impedance of the host structure. Thus the change of impedance measurement before and after damage occurrence can be used as the damage indicator. Since the impedance information may be measured at relatively high frequency range, the impedance method could be sensitive to small-sized damage. Generally, piezoelectric transducers are employed in the impedance approach, which can serve as actuator and sensor simultaneously. In this research, a magnetic transducer approach is investigated for impedance based damage detection. To provide design guidelines, the analytical model of the resistive magnetic impedance measurement circuit is formulated. During the formulation, the two-way magneto-mechanical coupling between the transducer and the structure is systematically studied by using the Maxwell’s equations. The preliminary sensor enhancement is achieved by selecting the number <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in the electrical coil. Moreover, in order to reduce the negative effects of the high inherent inductance and large parasitic resistance of the coil with a large number <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> a new measurement circuitry is proposed, in which a negative resistive element and a capacitor are introduced to be serially connected with the original resistive circuit. Correlated numerical and experimental studies are carried out to validate the magnetic transducer in impedance based damage detection. ...|$|R
