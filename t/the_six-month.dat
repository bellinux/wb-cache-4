5|$|For males, social {{structure}} {{changes can be}} seasonal. During <b>the</b> <b>six-month</b> period between December and May a few males immigrate between groups.

40|$|More {{than two}} decades ago, {{professor}} Leymann (1990), suggested that negative behaviour in the workplace should last {{at least six months}} in order to be labelled as workplace bullying. This operationalisation has since been repeatedly cited and applied in different studies on workplace bullying, despite a lack of empiric evidence regarding its validity. The aim {{of this study was to}} critically and empirically assess the validity of <b>the</b> <b>six-months</b> operationalisation of <b>the</b> duration criterion. For this end, we conducted a qualitative study consisting of 18 semi-structured interviews with prevention advisors in psychosocial aspects. The interview survey was based on the most widely used measure of workplace bullying, the Negative Acts Questionnaire Revised (NAQ-R; Einarsen, Hoel & Notelaers, 2009). The participants were asked to answer based on their professional experience how long different negative acts should last in order to be labelled as workplace bullying. Additionally, their overall opinion regarding <b>the</b> <b>six-months</b> operationalisation was questioned as well. The results point out that prevention advisors did not agree on <b>the</b> <b>six-months</b> operationalisation of <b>the</b> duration criterion. In fact, the most referred duration criterion was one month. However, the prevention advisors did imply shorter timeframes for physical- and personal-related negative acts, and longer timeframes for work-related negative acts. This findings are relevant as they suggest that a new operationalisation of the duration criterion might be in order. In addition, these findings suggest that different studies so far might have underestimated the scope of bullying in the workplace. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>six-month</b> {{fight against}} Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|Edward I {{became the}} king of England in 1272.

He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually walled, towns called bastides across Gascony {{as part of his}} attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England.|$|E

This film—directed, like its predecessor, by Temple—was formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to Swindles focus on McLaren and the media. In 2002—the year of the Queen's Golden Jubilee—the Sex Pistols reunited again to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. In 2003, their Piss Off Tour took them around North America for three weeks.|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during <b>the</b> <b>six-month</b> trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended for three more months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E
