40|$|The Medical Quality Improvement Consortium (MQIC) is a {{nationwide}} collaboration of 74 healthcare delivery systems, consisting of 3755 clinicians, who contribute de-identified clinical {{data from the}} same commercial electronic medical record (EMR) for quality reporting, outcomes research and clinical research in public health and practice benchmarking. Despite {{the existence of a}} common, centrally-managed, shared terminology for core concepts (medications, problem lists, observation names), a substantial “back-end” information management process is required to ensure terminology and data harmonization for creating multi-facility clinically-acceptable queries and comparable results. We describe the information architecture created to support <b>terminology</b> <b>harmonization</b> across this data-sharing consortium and discuss the implications for large scale data sharing envisioned by proponents for the national adoption of ambulatory EMR systems...|$|E

Our approach to reference modelling defines a generic business process for the domain, recognising that {{this needs to be}} adapted to support the “variability ” required by different users of the domain. We have implemented the following variations: activity ordering, cross-site <b>terminology</b> <b>harmonization,</b> and specific business rules to address the variability requirements. In this paper we present an approach for implementing these variations that combines business rules implemented in a commercially available Rule Language and XML-based rules. The XML rules have been used to implement varying instances of the process. These rules have been implemented at several architectural levels and an evaluation of the flexibility and adaptability provided by these rules is presented. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this COVARM {{research}} project is to define a candidate reference model utilizing a framework of web services to support a key UK Higher Education business process. Any given business domain may offer a level of complexity such that process activities, terminology (the ontology) and business rules may vary between organizations belonging to same domain. While a generic process can and has been built {{as part of the}} reference model, the flexibility (or variability) is afforded by the implementation strategy for the canonical model/generic process. We have implemented the following variations: activity ordering, cross-site <b>terminology</b> <b>harmonization,</b> and specific business rules to address the variability requirements. This paper presents our experience with explicitly managing the variability within the implementation technology. With the use of BPEL patterns, we describe how the management of these variations can be dealt with in an SOA application implementation...|$|E
40|$|H u n g a r yClassification, an applied area of soil science, lacks {{a common}} set of <b>{{terminology}}.</b> <b>Harmonization</b> of the basic terminology of modern classification systems is suggested. Most early soil classification systems were based on the recognition of soil forming processes. The properties that result from soil processes are more easily quantifiable than soil processes themselves. Modern systems classify soils based on quantitative characteristics defined as diagnostic horizons, properties and materials. Soil-forming processes are de-emphasized, but remain in the background philosophy of classification. The two most widely used classification schemes are Soil Taxonomy(ST) and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). In these two systems, and in several national classification systems many of the same diagnostic features are used, but often defined differently. In some cases, identical terms are used, but given different definitions. Is that a problem? Any science needs a consistent and precise terminology. The lack of consistency makes correlation difficult. Other disciplines have difficulty using our information. Respect from other disciplines? Confusions in teaching soil classification. The World Reference Base for Soil Resource...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increased}} {{level of activity}} in the biomedical and health informatics world (e-prescribing, electronic health records, personal health records) that, in the near future, will yield a wealth of available data that we can exploit meaningfully to strengthen knowledge building and evidence creation, and ultimately improve clinical and preventive care. The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) 2008 Health Policy Conference was convened to focus and propel discussions about informatics-enabled evidence-based care, clinical research, and knowledge management. Conference participants explored the potential of informatics tools and technologies to improve the evidence base on which providers and patients can draw to diagnose and treat health problems. The paper presents a model of an evidence continuum that is dynamic, collaborative, and powered by health informatics technologies. The conference's findings are described, and recommendations on <b>terminology</b> <b>harmonization,</b> facilitation of the evidence continuum in a “wired” world, development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines and other knowledge support strategies, {{and the role of}} diverse stakeholders in the generation and adoption of evidence are presented...|$|E
40|$|The International Society for Exposure Analysis (ISEA) and its Nomenclature Committee {{have been}} {{involved}} since the mid- 1990 s in an intermittent but ongoing effort to develop an official ISEA glossary. Several related activities have stimulated greater interest and discussion nationally and internationally on a common exposure language. Among these activites are a 1997 Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology feature article on exposure and dose definitions and a 1999 -initiated project of the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) (WHO/ILO/UNEP) to confront <b>terminology</b> issues hindering <b>harmonization</b> {{in the area of}} exposure assessment. Recently the ISEA members voted in support of adopting the IPCS glossary as the official ISEA glossary, and the ISEA Executive Board agreed to accept this recommendation. In this feature article we (1) describe the process through which the ISEA adopted the IPCS glossary as the official ISEA glossary, (2) present the joint IPCS/ISEA glossary of terms and their definitions, and (3) discuss plans for how the glossary can be used by ISEA and updated over time by ISEA and IPCS. The glossary is intended to be a living document that reflects the latest usage and maintains international <b>harmonization</b> of exposure <b>terminology</b> that can be practically applied to improve communication in exposure and related fields...|$|R
40|$|The 3 d {{workshop}} {{within the}} IIASA project “Challenges and Opportunities of Economic Integration within a Wider European and Eurasian Space” held on 20 - 21 November, 2014 in Laxenburg, Austria discussed {{the major issues}} related to the compatibility and costs of technical regulations used by different countries and unions, and also the non-tariff barriers affecting the trade among them. The workshop concentrated on major aspects related to the existing non-tariff barriers in trade between the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the European Union (EU), and other CIS countries. The participants discussed the challenges related to the general non-tariff barriers that exist between the EU, the EAEU, and the CIS countries, as well as possible solutions, particularly in the context of recent economic and political developments. The workshop also discussed the relationship between the norms and principles of international trade law contained in the provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO); analyzed the legal framework of economic integration in various regions of the world; and reflected on the potential for eliminating unnecessary obstacles to trade, including by mutual recognition of conformity. The workshop was focused particularly on the potential effects of the implementation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTA) between the EU and Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. It also addressed the economic impacts of the currently applied mutual sanctions conflict” between the EU, the USA and some other Western nations on the one hand, and Russia on the other, their impacts on international trade, and on the potentials of long-term cooperation between the EU and the EAEU. The impacts on economies of other CIS countries, not directly involved, were also touched upon. Harmonization of legislation in the field of technical, as well as sanitary, phytosanitary, and veterinary regulations between the EAEU and other regions, primarily the EU, was addressed in detail. The discussion covered the <b>harmonization</b> of <b>terminology</b> and labeling; <b>harmonization</b> of national and regional standards with international standards; accreditation, product safety, training in the field of standardization and conformity assessment as well as trade facilitation. In order to foster interdisciplinary and international dialogue on the topic, the workshop brought together well-established scientists, policymakers, banks and companies representatives from around the world, including: Péter Balás, Deputy Director General, DG Trade, European Commission; Igor Finogenov, Chairman of the Management Board, Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), Kazakhstan; Pavel Kabat, Director General and Chief Executive Officer, IIASA; Evgeny Vinokurov, Director, Centre for Integration Studies, Eurasian Development Bank; Paul de Lusignan, Leading Expert, Tariff and Non-Tariff Negotiations, Rules of Origin, DG Trade, European Commission,, Stefanie Harter, Head, Liaison Office to the German Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Interior and Justice, German Agency for International Cooperation, Evgeny Hotulev, Director, Department of Macroeconomic Policy, Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), Oleg Noginskiy, Director, Ukrainian Association Suppliers of the Customs Union, Veronika Movchan, Director, Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting (IER), Alessandro Nicita, Officer-in-Charge, Trade Policy Research Section, Trade Analysis Branch, Division on International Trade, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), among many others, with a total of 41 participants. The workshop participants discussed possible ways how non-tariff barriers could be reduced and convergence of technical regulations to the mutual benefit of all parties involved could be achieved. In this context, they also analyzed the opportunities and risks of economic modernization of the East-European partnership countries, if they adapt to European technical regulations and sanitary requirements. Possibilities for providing a unified policy, removing bottlenecks and differences in the sphere of technical regulation in the EAEU countries, was examined; and the impacts of such policy on producers of goods and services in different regions with regard to ensuring their competitiveness were assessed...|$|R
40|$|Scientific and {{technical}} terminology represents a very topical issue in economically and technologically dependent countries with small languages such as Serbian. The current terminological {{problems in the}} Serbian language, especially in specialized areas that are experiencing dynamic development, are: Anglicization of the language for special purposes, underdeveloped and unstable terminology, and lack of adequate and modern terminological and lexical resources. On the one hand, the terminological problems listed above are of concern to subject-field specialists, since inadequate and non-existent terminology significantly affects the representation, transfer and management of specialized knowledge and information. On the other hand, terminology and language planners point to the growing need for immediate and systematic intervention aimed at <b>terminology</b> <b>harmonization,</b> consolidation and standardization. In spite of the awareness, there is no systematic approach to the solving of terminological problems in Serbian. In addition, practical activities regarding the collection and organization of terminology are few and reduced to individual initiatives. Under the paradigm of language planning (LP) -oriented terminology management (2), this paper is going to address a practical activity of terminology management: {{the creation of a}} Serbian management terminology database (TDB) with equivalent terms in English. The paper will discuss the methodology of terminology work, potential obstacles in termbase creation, as well as potential benefits that such a resource would have on all its potential users: management specialists and practitioners, professional translators, and language and terminology planners. A particular focus will be placed on the potential significance that this kind of a database would have for terminology policy and planning in the Serbian language, on the one hand, and knowledge transfer and management, on the other hand...|$|E
