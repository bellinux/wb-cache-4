5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He <b>traveled</b> <b>a</b> touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The meteoroid's {{absolute}} magnitude (the apparent magnitude {{it would have}} {{at an altitude of}} 100km at the observer's zenith) was approximately−6 and did not vary significantly during the few seconds of observation. It <b>traveled</b> <b>a</b> distance of 409km in 9.8seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by the friction of the atmosphere reached only 1.7m/s2 at the fireball's perigee (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D.W.Olson, R.L.Doescher and K.M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the deceleration was less than 0.5m/s2 except for a few seconds near perigee. This small loss of speed, 12m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's velocity vector due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see Orbit).|$|E

25|$|After this, Zinaida Serebriakova <b>{{traveled}}</b> <b>a</b> great deal. In 1928 and 1930 {{she traveled}} to Africa, visiting Morocco.

She also painted a cycle devoted to Breton fishermen.

25|$|The dog is {{a classic}} example of a {{domestic}} animal that likely <b>traveled</b> <b>a</b> commensal pathway into domestication. The dog was the first domesticant, and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before cultivation or the domestication of other animals. It may have been inevitable that the first domesticated animal came from the order of carnivores as these are less afraid when approaching other species. Within the carnivores, the first domesticated animal would need to exist without an all-meat diet, possess a running and hunting ability to provide its own food, and be of a controllable size to coexist with humans, indicating the family Canidae, and the right temperament with wolves being among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet.|$|E

25|$|Koons {{then moved}} on to the Banality series. For this project he engaged {{workshops}} in Germany and Italy that had a long tradition of working in ceramic, porcelain, and wood. The series culminated in 1988 with Michael Jackson and Bubbles, a series of three life-size gold-leaf plated porcelain statues of the sitting singer cuddling Bubbles, his pet chimpanzee. Three years later, one of these sold at Sotheby's New York for US$5.6 million. Two of these sculptures are now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) in downtown Los Angeles. The statue was included in a 2004 retrospective at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo which <b>traveled</b> <b>a</b> year later to the Helsinki City Art Museum. It also featured in his second retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 2008. The statue is currently back at the newly opened Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art at Tjuvholmen in Oslo.|$|E
25|$|When Pennsylvania legislated {{routes in}} 1911, {{what would become}} PA 177 was not given a number except for the northernmost part along Old York Road, which was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 250. In 1920, the Old York Road {{became part of the}} Susquehanna Trail, an auto trail running between Baltimore and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Old York Road was designated as PA 4 in 1924. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 111 became concurrent with PA 4 on Old York Road, which was paved. By 1926, the current alignment of PA 177 southwest of Old York Road was an unnumbered, unpaved road, with a small portion northeast of present-day PA 74 paved. The concurrent PA 4 designation was removed from US 111 in 1928. The road between PA 74 and Potts Hill Road northeast of Lewisberry was paved in the 1930s. The road between Potts Hill Road and US 111 was paved in the 1940s. In the 1950s, US 111 was realigned off Old York Road onto I-83. PA 177 was designated in the 1960s to run from PA 74 in Rossville northeast to PA 262, with an interchange at I-83 near the northern terminus. PA 177 formerly turned left onto Old York Road and <b>traveled</b> <b>a</b> short distance northwest to an intersection with PA 262; this segment was eliminated when the PA 262 intersection was realigned in 2011.|$|E

Bob entered the Canadian province of New Brunswick a few hours later, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.
