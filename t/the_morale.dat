5|$|The Canadian Official Historian, C. P. Stacey {{wrote that}} several Canadian {{formations}} reported {{an increase in}} morale. Wilmot wrote that the bombing was essential because it raised <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders.|$|E

5000|$|Outside of {{accepted}} limits, <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> {{government has}} continued coca eradication efforts. Its 2011 eradication effort {{set a new}} record: over the first eleven months, 10,051 hectares were eradicated. The strategy of <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government {{has been described as}} [...] "combating drug trafficking by working cooperatively with coca growers to diversify crops and promote alternative development." [...] In August 2015, the UN announced that coca cultivation was at its lowest in 13 years.|$|R
5|$|The US Navy leased {{the site}} in December 1975 and {{constructed}} additional facilities for personnel and their families, including a bar, filling station, post office, cinema, chapel, school, baseball diamond and a medical and dental centre.

5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after he considered <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the troops. Zou Yushan {{had promised to}} supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{served on}} the board of {{directors}} of Erhard Seminars Training (EST). Several key ARC personnel were also involved. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> and social cohesion of the ARC community.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the nightclub}} was raided, {{none of the}} women had more than fifteen pesos with them. Their {{earnings}} were held by <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> family, [...] "for safety." [...] If they didn't {{have access to a}} bank, the house where they lived and where they had no control over who their house mates were was probably not a secure place to keep large sums of cash. Banking with <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> family was probably more secure than cash under the mattress.|$|R
500|$|Most remixes of [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] were {{released}} in the US only, although few were found in certain territories. David <b>Morales</b> produced <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> club mix, which uses the song's original vocals with similar chord progressions {{to those of the}} original, and <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> Triumphant mix, which contains re-recorded vocals and new lyrics which transform the song into a jazz-like mix with harmonica sections. A spoken introduction was also added, featuring Carey's spoken voice before the first verse.|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of industrially produced chicken meat {{has been on}} the rise in Bolivia, {{at the same time as}} the philosophy of Vivir Bien has gained national and international attention. This paper provides detailed insights into the production, distribution, and {{consumption of}} industrial chicken meat in Bolivia (with a focus on the Cochabamba region). It asks how this tendency stands in relationship to the government discourse of Vivir Bien. The paper shows how the concrete policies of <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government have fostered the industrialization of the chicken meat sector and the food sector in general. The paper concludes that the discourse of <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government masks what is happening “on the ground” in Bolivia. In the case of the chicken meat sector, the concern for food security has been more important to <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government than environmental standards, animal health, the situation of small-scale producers, and the identity aspect of food consumption...|$|R
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, {{so as to avoid}} any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E
5|$|Saleh on the BBC's Hard Talk {{explained}} and {{reiterated that}} Karzai in hoping {{to reach a}} deal with the Taliban and Pakistan's ISI through appeasement policy had alienated his internal allies as well as Afghanistan's external allies and had undermined <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of Afghan security forces.|$|E
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Morales</b> {{government}} had implemented {{a tax increase}} because it was hoping to recoup $83 million in unpaid mining taxes. The government is also seeking to increase this tax income [...] "to as much as $300 million" [...] due to increased international demand for its natural resources. Morales has also stated that {{his goal is to}} nationalize Bolivia’s entire mining sector, of which this tax increase is seen as a first step. <b>The</b> <b>Morales</b> {{government had}} maintained that the [...] "tax increase would be relatively minor for <b>the</b> cooperatives". <b>The</b> <b>Morales</b> government had attempted to head-off the demonstration by announcing on Feb. 5, 2007 that the tax increase was not directed at the 50,000 miners who are co-op members but at larger private mining companies. His government announced that the cooperatives' taxes would be [...] "frozen at current levels until further notice". This did not dissuade the thousands of protestors who had already gathered nearby the capital in the less affluent city of El Alto.|$|R

25|$|The news angered many in Los Zetas, {{who were}} jealous {{of how much}} money <b>Morales</b> was earning. <b>The</b> fact that <b>Morales</b> sought to expand his {{business}} in the U.S. and use some regions as refuge angered Lazcano. In November 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> clan sidelined Lazcano's faction, which motivated other groups to fight back.|$|R
5|$|The American colonists {{met their}} goal of {{strengthening}} {{the siege of}} Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from {{the reach of the}} British regulars. The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant boost to <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the Colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.|$|E
5|$|The victory lifted <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the Christian princes of Europe and was {{recognized}} as a great victory over the Muslim Ottoman Empire. On the Ottoman side, Murad realized the effect Skanderbeg's rebellion would have on his realm and continued to take measures to defeat him, resulting in twenty-five years of war.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, CONAMAQ and CIDOB {{withdrew from}} the Pact. Both {{organizations}} underwent internal disputes {{in the years that}} followed. One faction of each split, aligned with <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government, re-joined <b>the</b> Pact in 2013.|$|R
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
500|$|An {{exclusive}} remix of [...] "Throb", <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> Badyard Mix, {{was included}} on Jackson's remix compilation album Janet Remixed in 1995. Peter Rauhofer remixed [...] "Throb" [...] in 2013 and released the remix on Valentine's Day.|$|R
50|$|After Morales' {{victory in}} the recall referendum, <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> {{government}} claimed that right wing forces led by Ruben Costas, Mario Cossio, Leopoldo Fernandez and Ernesto Suarez rejected {{the result of the}} vote and on September 2008, launched a civil coup d'état, seizing public building and airports in the Departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija; attacking government officials and Morales supporters, and calling for civil disobedience. This included the occupation of the National Institute for Agrarian Reform (INRA)'s Pando office. Campesinos, largely aligned with <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government, feared their recently granted land titles were at risk, although in fact they were safely stored in a military barracks.|$|R
50|$|In early February 2007, {{parts of}} the Bolivian region of La Paz were brought to a {{standstill}} as 20,000 miners took to the roads and streets to protest a tax hike to the Complementary Mining Tax (ICM) by <b>the</b> <b>Morales</b> government. <b>The</b> protesting miners threw dynamite and clashed with those passing by. <b>The</b> <b>Morales</b> government had attempted to head-off the demonstration by announcing on February 5, 2007, that the tax increase was not directed at the 50,000 miners who are co-op members but at larger private mining companies. This did not dissuade the thousands of protestors who had already gathered nearby the capital in the less affluent city of El Alto.|$|R
5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the Chinese military in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he had no control over due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the battle}} was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} to threaten the Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> of the 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
