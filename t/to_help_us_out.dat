During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He [...] came {{in the last couple of}} sessions <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple of our friends that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier.

Margaret had missed Verona and Venice in her previous Italian journey--fear of the mosquito had driven her mother across Italy to the westward route--and now she could fill up her gaps and see the Titians and Paul Veroneses she already knew in colourless photographs, the Carpaccios, (the St. George series delighted her beyond measure,) the Basaitis and that great statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni that Ruskin praised.|$|E

40|$|The mining of {{frequent}} patterns in databases {{has been studied}} for several years. However, the real-world data tends to be dirty and frequent pattern mining which extracts patterns that are absolutely matched is not enough.

In our approach, both {{of the problems of}} mining proportional and fixed FT-patterns are considered. In proportional FT-pattern mining, the number of faults tolerable in a pattern is proportional to the length of the pattern.

60|$|But {{the young}} people under my care seemed in no haste to mingle in it. We oldsters are always fancying youth impatient, {{but there is no}} time of life which has so much patience. It behaves as if it had eternity before it--an eternity of youth--instead of a few days and years, and then the frosty poll.

60|$|In one {{of these}} City churches, and only in one, I found an {{individual}} {{who might have been}} claimed as expressly a City personage. I remember the church, by the feature that the clergyman couldn't get to his own desk without going through the clerk's, or couldn't get to the pulpit without going through the reading-desk--I forget which, and it is no matter--and by the presence of this personage among the exceedingly sparse congregation. I doubt if we were a dozen, and we had no exhausted charity school <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>out.</b> The personage was dressed in black of square cut, and was stricken in years, and wore a black velvet cap, and cloth shoes. He was of a staid, wealthy, and dissatisfied aspect. In his hand, he conducted to church a mysterious child: a child of the feminine gender. The child had a beaver hat, with a stiff drab plume that surely never belonged to any bird of the air. The child was further attired in a nankeen frock and spencer, brown boxing-gloves, and a veil. It had a blemish, in the nature of currant jelly, on its chin; and was a thirsty child. Insomuch that the personage carried in his pocket a green bottle, from which, when the first psalm was given out, the child was openly refreshed. At all other times throughout the service it was motionless, and stood on the seat of the large pew, closely fitted into the corner, like a rain-water pipe.|$|E
6000|$|I recover it as for {{ourselves}} a beautifully mixed adventure, a brave little seeing {{of the world}} on the happy pretext of [...] "lessons." [...] We had lessons from time to time, but had them in company with ladies and gentlemen, young men and young women of the Anglo-Saxon family, who sat at long boards of green cloth with us and with several of our contemporaries, English and American boys, taking dictées from the head of the house himself or from the aged and most remarkable M. Bonnefons, whom we believed to have been a superannuated actor (he above all such a model for Daudet!) and who interrupted our abashed readings aloud to him of the French classics older and newer by wondrous reminiscences and even imitations of Talma. He moved among us in a cloud of legend, the wigged and wrinkled, the impassioned, though I think alas underfed, M. Bonnefons: it was our belief that he [...] "went back," [...] beyond the first Empire, to the scenes of the Revolution--this perhaps partly by reason, in the first place, of his scorn of our pronunciation, when we met it, of the sovereign word liberté, the poverty of which, our deplorable [...] "libbeté," [...] without r's, he mimicked and derided, sounding the right, the revolutionary form out splendidly, with thirty r's, the prolonged beat of a drum. And then we believed him, if artistically conservative, politically obnoxious to the powers that then were, though knowing that those so marked had to walk, and even to breathe, cautiously for fear of the mouchards of the tyrant; we knew all about mouchards and talked of them as we do to-day of aviators or suffragettes--to remember which in an age so candidly unconscious of them is to feel how much history we have seen unrolled. There were times when he but paced up and down and round the long table--I see him as never seated, but always on the move, a weary Wandering Jew of the classe; but in particular I hear him recite to us the combat with the Moors from Le Cid and show us how Talma, describing it, seemed to crouch down on his haunches in order to spring up again terrifically to the height of [...] "Nous nous levons alors!" [...] which M. Bonnefons rendered as if on the carpet there fifty men at least had leaped to their feet. But he threw off these broken lights with a quick relapse to indifference; he didn't like the Anglo-Saxon--of the children of Albion at least his view was low; on his American specimens he had, I observed, more mercy; and this imperfection of sympathy (the question of Waterloo apart) rested, it was impossible not to feel, on his so resenting the dishonour suffered at our hands by his beautiful tongue, to which, as the great field of elocution, he was patriotically devoted. I think he fairly loathed our closed English vowels and confused consonants, our destitution of sounds that he recognised as sounds; though why in this connection he put up best with our own compatriots, embroiled at that time often in even stranger vocables than now, is more than I can say. I think that would be explained perhaps by his feeling in them as an old equalitarian certain accessibilities quand même. Besides, we of the younger persuasion at least must have done his ear less violence than those earnest ladies from beyond the sea and than those young Englishmen qualifying for examinations and careers who flocked with us both to the plausibly spread and the severely disgarnished table, and on whose part I seem to see it again an effort of anguish to [...] "pick up" [...] the happy idiom that we had unconsciously acquired. French, in the fine old formula of those days, so much diffused, [...] "was the language of the family"; but I think it must have appeared to these students in general a family of which the youngest members were but scantly kept in their place. We piped with a greater facility and to a richer meed of recognition; which sounds as if we might have become, in these strange collocations, fairly offensive little prigs. That was none the less not the case, for there were, oddly enough, a few French boys as well, to whom on the lingual or the [...] "family" [...] ground, we felt ourselves feebly relative, and in comparison with whom, for that matter, or with one of whom, I remember an occasion of my having to sink to insignificance. There was at the Institution little of a staff--besides waiters and bonnes; but it embraced, such as it was, M. Mesnard as well as M. Bonnefons--M. Mesnard of the new generation, instructor in whatever it might be, among the arts, that didn't consist of our rolling our r's, and with them, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>out,</b> more or less our eyes. It is significant that this elegant branch is now quite vague to me; and I recall M. Mesnard, in fine, as no less modern and cheap than M. Bonnefons was rare and unappraiseable. He had nevertheless given me his attention, one morning, doubtless patiently enough, in some corner of the villa that we had for the moment practically to ourselves--I seem to see a small empty room looking on the garden; when there entered to us, benevolently ushered by Madame Fezandié, a small boy of very fair and romantic aspect, as it struck me, a pupil newly arrived. I remember of him mainly that he had a sort of nimbus of light curls, a face delicate and pale and that deeply hoarse voice with which French children used to excite our wonder. M. Mesnard asked of him at once, with interest, his name, and on his pronouncing it sought to know, with livelier attention, if he were then the son of M. Arsène Houssaye, lately director of the Théâtre Français. To this distinction the boy confessed--all to such intensification of our répétiteur's interest that I knew myself quite dropped, in comparison, from his scheme of things. Such an origin as our little visitor's affected him visibly as dazzling, and I felt justified after a while, in stealing away into the shade. The beautiful little boy was to live to be the late M. Henry Houssaye, the shining hellenist and historian. I have never forgotten the ecstasy of hope in M. Mesnard's question--as a light on the reverence then entertained for the institution M. Houssaye the elder had administered.|$|E

40|$|Non-adherence to {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{treatment is}} a major challenge to global TB control because it {{increases the risk of}} treatment failure, relapse and the emergence of drug-resistant TB. Although the problem is widely acknowledged, there is still no clarity about the exact impact of different levels and patterns of non-adherence on treatment outcome. This hampers the provision of adequate advice to patients and clinicians, and it challenges the development and evaluation of adherence-promoting interventions. In this article, we explain why we are still in the dark with respect to predicting how different types of non-adherence to TB treatment affect treatment outcome. We show that we lack uniformity in how we define and measure non-adherence, that we have no easily accessible treatment success indicators, and that the relationship between treatment adherence and outcome is influenced by a number of pathogenic, immunological and pharmacological factors that are only partly understood. We conclude that an integral 'bench and bedside approach' that incorporates experimental studies with in vitro models and animals, as well as observational studies in patients with TB, is needed <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> of the dark regarding the adherence-response relationship in TB treatment...|$|R
