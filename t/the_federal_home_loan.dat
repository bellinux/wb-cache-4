In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as general counsel for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused of {{corruption}} in 1989, igniting a major political scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was the target of a regulatory investigation by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{testified against}} Keating {{in a civil}} suit brought by Lincoln bondholders, and {{was seen as the}} plaintiffs' best witness. The other four {{senators}} refused to testify. Cranston left office in January 1993, and died in December 2000. DeConcini and Riegle continued to serve in the Senate until their terms expired, but they did not seek re-election in 1994. DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, trying to become the first senator ever to win a fourth term from Ohio. The Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor R. Michael DeWine, attacked Glenn on Keating Five {{as well as a number}} of other matters, in one of the dirtiest campaigns in the country that year and the toughest of Glenn's senatorial contests. Glenn prevailed, however, defeating DeWine by nine percentage points to gain one more term in the Senate before retiring and not running for re-election in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to expand credit and stimulate building, Kennedy ordered a {{reduction}} in the maximum permissible interest rate on FHA insured loans, reduced the interest rate on Small Business Administration loans in distressed areas, expanded its available credit and liberalized lending by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Banks. The Federal Reserve Board was also encouraged to help keep long-term interest rates low through the purchase of long-term government issues.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, {{the federal}} {{government}} authorized Fannie Mae to purchase conventional mortgages, the same year it went public on New York and Pacific Exchanges, (Residential Mortgage Loan Origination 2nd edition pg.8, J.Keith Baker 2010), i.e. those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), colloquially known as Freddie Mac, to compete with Fannie Mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market.|$|E

5000|$|The OTS was {{established}} in 1989 {{in response to the}} savings and loan crisis. On television, President George H. W.

Savings and Loan legislation—the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989—"abolished", or renamed, <b>the</b> independent <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board to the Office of Thrift Supervision and placed it under Department of the Treasury supervision. On 22 March 1990, in a setback to the George H. W. Bush Administration, Federal District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that OTS appointments of the former director and acting director, M. Danny Wall and Salvatore R. Martoche, had been unconstitutional because they were not nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.|$|R
25|$|This is {{sometimes}} called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market {{is made up of}} high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.|$|E
25|$|Homeownership {{has been}} {{promoted}} as government policy using several means involving mortgage debt and the government sponsored entities Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Banks, which fund or guarantee $6.5 trillion of assets {{with the purpose of}} directly or indirectly promoting homeownership. Homeownership has been further promoted through tax policy which allows a tax deduction for mortgage interest payments on a primary residence. The Community Reinvestment Act also encourages homeownership for low-income earners. The promotion of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage borrowing and lending has given rise to debates regarding government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E

25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{damage to}} S {{operations}} led Congress to act, passing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in August 1981 and initiating the regulatory changes by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board allowing S {{to sell their}} mortgage loans and use the cash generated to seek better returns soon after enactment; the losses created by the sales were to be amortized {{over the life of}} the loan, and any losses could also be offset against taxes paid over the preceding ten years. This all made S eager to sell their loans. The buyers – major Wall Street firms – were quick to take advantage of the S' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees. S were one group buying these bonds, holding $150 billion by 1986, and being charged substantial fees for the transactions.|$|E

[...] Keating called McCain a [...] "wimp" [...] behind his back, and on March 24 the two had a heated, contentious meeting.

Gray, chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board, and then members of the FHLBB San Francisco branch, to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.

500|$|Beginning in 1985, Edwin J. Gray, {{chair of}} <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> Bank Board (FHLBB), {{feared that the}} savings industry's risky {{investment}} practices were exposing the government's insurance funds to huge losses.

Lincoln had become burdened with bad debt resulting from its past aggressiveness, and by early 1986, its investment practices were being investigated and audited by the FHLBB: in particular, whether it had violated these direct investment rules; Lincoln had directed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured accounts into commercial real estate ventures.|$|E
