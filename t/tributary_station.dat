40|$|ABSTRACT. Flow and {{concentrations}} of suspended sediment, nitrate–N, phosphate–P, atrazine, and metolachlor were monitored {{during the spring}} seasons of 1998 and 1999, primarily during storm events, at a <b>tributary</b> <b>station</b> (Big Ditch) and two main–stem stations (Fisher and Mahomet) of the Upper Sangamon River watershed in east central Illinois. These three stations respectively drain 98, 622, and 932 km 2 of mainly agricultural lands. Rainfall {{data were collected from}} six newly established raingage stations. The study provides a valuable database to understand some of the complex physical and chemical processes in an east central Illinois watershed and to calibrate, validate, and evaluate mathematical models. Analyses of the limited data from different sampling methods showed consistencies among the methods. The nitrate–N concentrations in Big Ditch during intense storms of 1998 showed inverse relationships with water discharge. Higher goodness–of–fit of the relationships was found within the data for individual months than for the combined set, showing dependence on varying climate, land cover, and management practices during the growing season. The nitrate–N concentrations at each of the three stations during less intense storms in 1999 showed weak positive relationships with water discharge. The total nitrate–N load in Big Ditch generated by the storms of March, May, and June of 1998 was similar to the average annual load, indicating the importance of single–event storms, and therefore their need for close attention. After the intense storm of April 1999, the less intense storms during May and June after long low–flow periods significantly raised the nitrate–N concentrations in all three stations. A similar pattern was noticed in the 1998 observations before each of the majo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{an attempt}} to study the {{environmental}} impacts of dredging on water quality, surface water was monitored for over one year, from December 1997 to December 1998. Samples were collected twice before dredging, in December 1997 and in June 1998, corresponding to dry and raining seasons, respectively. Samples were also collected immediately after dredging in July 1998 and were monitored in August, September and December 1998. Collected samples were analyzed from five stations within the study area, station 1 - 5. Station 1 was in the dredged canal, which was originally a side branch of the Warri River tributary. In the Warri River <b>tributary,</b> <b>Station</b> 2 was 500 m upstream and Station 3 was 1000 m upstream of the mouth of the dredged canal, whilst Stations 4 and 5 were respectively 500 m and 1000 m downstream of it. Stations 3 and 5 represented the reference situation to which possible dredging effects could be compared. The water physico-chemistry prior to dredging was consistent with that of other locations within the Niger Delta. As a result of dredging however, the pH of the dredged canal was decreased from 7. 2 to 4. 0, dissolved oxygen (DO) decreased considerably from 6. 0 mg/l to 0. 4 mg/L, while BOD 5 was increased from 1. 0 mg/l to 18. 0 mg/L. COD, oil and grease, conductivity, TDS and sulphate values similarly increased, while nitrate and alkalinity values decreased after dredging. At the dredged canal, turbidity and TSS increased rapidly after dredging, attaining a value of 11, 398 NTU and 8200 mg/l respectively.

The components of a {{communications system}} serve a common purpose, are technically compatible, use common procedures, respond to controls, and operate in unison. A typical communication link includes, at a minimum, three key elements: a transmitter, a communication medium (or channel), and a receiver. The ability to simulate all three of these elements is required in order to successfully model any end-to-end communication system.

With graphical programming, the diagram is the source code, depicted as an arrangement of nodes connected by wires. Each piece of data flows through the wires, to be consumed by nodes that transform the data mathematically or perform some action such as I/O. The visual simulator allows us to model end-to-end communication systems at the signal or physical level. We use VisSim/ Comm to build both transmitter and receiver models, filters and equalizers, as well as channel models and coding techniques from a first principles perspective, by selecting and connecting predefined blocks.

The flow record from the U. S. Geological Survey gaging station at Empire appears to give the most reliable flow data and has the longest record (33 years). An effort by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) to recalibrate other Vermillion River flow gaging stations appears to have resulted in self-consistent data for 2007 flows in the main stem and at <b>tributary</b> <b>stations.</b> Although many of the stream gaging stations examined in this study have flow records of up to eight years, flow data prior to 2007 have to be used with caution.

The monthly and 7 Q 2 flows are representative of typical flow conditions, while the 7 Q 10 flow is an extreme low flow condition.

Significant changes in streamflow have been detected; these changes result in part from large number of {{soil and water conservation}} measures implemented over the past six decades in this area. This study investigates streamflow variations and evaluates the impacts of climate variability and human activity on the mean annual flow in the MRYRB. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test are applied to characterize the trends and abrupt changes of hydro-climatic variables in the MRYRB. The analysis was performed on streamflow data taken over the period from the 1950 s to 2010 at 18 hydrological stations and on precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data from 43 climate stations. We find that 16 of these stations recorded significant decreases in annual streamflow, with reduction rates ranging from 0. 10. mm/yr to 1. 61. mm/yr over the study period. Precipitation at all of the stations also had negative trends, with changes ranging from - 4. 7. mm/yr to - 0. 19. mm/yr. Temperature increased significantly at most stations, while PET showed a mixed of upward and downward trend. Abrupt changes in streamflow at mainstream stations occurred when large reservoirs were built, while breakpoints of streamflow at <b>tributary</b> <b>stations</b> were mainly driven by the implementation of soil and water conservation measures. We used both Budyko's curve (a simple water balance model) and linear regression to evaluate the potential impacts of climate variability and human activities on mean annual streamflow. Climate variability has a greater effect on the streamflow reduction in the Beiluo River and Yan River, while human activities accounted for more of the streamflow changes in other tributaries, especially in the northern catchments. In general, human activities, including soil and water conservation projects, the operation of dams and reservoirs, and water consumption, are found to be the dominant factors responsible for the significant decline in the annual streamflow in the MRYRB over the last six decades...|$|R

This paper investigates the spatial and temporal variations of annual sediment load in the section between Hekouzhen and Longmen in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin from 1962 to 2009 by using annual observations at 21 hydrological gauging stations (4 mainstream and 17 <b>tributaries</b> <b>stations),</b> by making use of Mann-Kendall test and simple linear regression for trend detection, and the sequential cluster analysis method and Student's t test for changing point detection. The results suggest that sediment load from both mainstream and tributaries show significant decreasing trends at confidence level of 0. 01. Evident abrupt changing points are detected around 1970 s for most stations, but for Toudaoguai station and Fugu station are found in the mid- 1980 s, which are mainly attributed to the operation of Longyangxia Dam. In addition, abrupt changes in the sediment series at some <b>stations</b> from the <b>tributaries</b> were found around the late 1990 s, this situation may be resulted from the "Green for Grain" project launched in 1999. Sediment budget analysis indicates that the 17 tributaries contributes 70. 60 % sediment load to the whole research area, which suggests that the majority sediment load contribution to He-Long region is from these tributaries. The comparison among three mainstream sections implies that the sediment is mainly from Wubao-Longmen section. And contribution of tributaries in each mainstream section is mainly from Huangfuchuan River, Kuye River, Wuding River and Yan River. The {{reduction of}} the sediment load is mainly caused by human activities especially soil and water conservation projects (such as afforestation, terraces, reservoirs and dams).

40|$|Flooding in the Yellow River basin (YRB) {{has changed}} {{significantly}} {{over the last}} few decades because of climate change and human activities. Determining how the flooding changed and identifying the main driving factors of flood change is crucial to flood risk assessment and water resources planning. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in the whole YRB. To fill this gap, we investigate the spatial and temporal change of the annual maximum flood (AMAXF) in the YRB using observed data from 32 key hydrological stations (including 15 mainstream <b>stations</b> and 17 <b>tributary</b> <b>stations).</b> The Mann-Kendall test combined with trend index method is used to evaluate the trend in precipitation and AMAXF. The trend results indicate the AMAXF over the whole basin is dominated by decreasing trends: 72 % of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends (at 0. 1 significance level) and 22 % of the stations show no significant decreasing trends in the AMAXF. Both flood trends and abrupt change time exhibit obvious regional differences: the flood decreases is more pronounced in the midstream basins than in the headwater of the basin; the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the early 1990 s for the upper reaches, and in the late 1990 s for the middle reaches. To investigate the causes of flood change, the trends of precipitation extremes are analyzed in relation to the trends of peak floods. The analysis reveals that the decreasing precipitation extremes only results in the AMAXF reduction in the upstream basin. The decreasing AMAXF in the midstream and downstream of the basin are mainly attributable to the impacts of human activities (mainly including dam construction and soil conservation practices). In general, anthropogenic impacts play an increasingly important role in the AMAXF changes in the YRB. According to the possible changes in forcing factors, the AMAXF over the whole basin is expected to further decrease in the near future. However, there are still large flood risks in the tributary basins due to the collapse of check dams caused by extreme storms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Yellow River is an {{important}} source of sediment flux to oceans in the world, and approximately 90 % of the sediment originates from the middle Yellow River, an area with known high rates of soil erosion and sediment delivery. Trends and interannual variations in sediment discharge have considerable implications for reservoir operation and river management of the lower Yellow River. The annual sediment discharge of four main stream <b>stations</b> and ten <b>tributary</b> <b>stations</b> was used to show the spatiotemporal variation in sediment yield and to quantify the relative contribution of precipitation change and human activities, especially the influence of vegetation restoration with implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GGP) in 1999. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to detect the abrupt change in sediment discharge since the 1950 s. The annual sediment yield of the middle Yellow River has shown a significant downward trend, decreasing by an order of magnitude in the last decade (2000 – 2010) compared with the 1950 s. Annual sediment yield was reduced by 95. 5 % from 3, 887. 0 [*][*]t·km− 2 ·year− 1 in the 1950 s to 174. 7 [*][*][*]t·km− 2 ·year− 1 in the 2000 s. The eastern part of the middle Yellow River basin showed the most significant decrease, with sediment yield decreasing up to 90 % in the 2000 s compared with the 1950 s. Annual precipitation decreased by 7. 3 % in the periods 1980 – 2010 and 1959 – 1979. Human activities and precipitation explain 83. 6 and 16. 4 % of the total reduction in sediment yield, respectively, using the double mass curve method. Annual sediment discharge decreased by 597 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1 —from 660 × 106 in 1980 – 1999 to 63 × 106 in 2000 – 2010. Sediment deposition along the Longmen-Huayuankou section amounted to 120 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1 during 1980 – 1999 and 229 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1 during 2000 – 2010 based on mass balance. The additional 109 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1 of sediment was trapped following completion of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in the Longmen-Huayuankou section. This explains 18. 3 % of the sediment reduction in the 2000 s. Soil conservation practices have further reduced sediment discharge by 253 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1, which explains about 42. 4 % of the decrease (597 × 106) during 2000 – 2010. A reduction of approximately 235 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1 occurred because of vegetation restoration driven by the Grain for Green Project, which accounted for 39. 4 % of the total reduction (597 × 106 [*][*]t·year− 1) in the last decade compared to 1980 – 1999.

Nitrate concentration (NO 3) data were measured from 1972 to 2012 at five stations in the Lower Illinois River basin, USA. The bivariate distribution was represented by applying three copula models to explore the dependence between discharge and nitrate concentration. The marginal distributions for the copula models include the generalized Pareto (GPA), generalized extreme value (GEV), two-parameter lognormal (LN 2), and three-parameter lognormal (LN 3) distributions as well as the three copula models of Clayton, Frank, and Gumbel, respectively. Each procedure was tested by the robust diagnostic, the probability plot correlation coefficient (PPCC) test, and the goodness-of-fit test (statistic). Consequently, the Frank copula model with GPA for stream flow–GPA for nitrate concentration performed more accurately for data from the mainstream stations, Havana (D- 31) and Valley City (D- 32) and for those from a <b>station</b> on one <b>tributary,</b> Oakford <b>station</b> along the Sangamon River (E- 25).

Thirty sampling sites in tributaries and one in the channel of the Meia Ponte River, in its upper course, were selected to capture fish with dipnets (3 mm mesh) during one hour, along 100 -m stretch. Sampling periods (season; rainy and dry) and the categorization according to the distance of the sampling station {{from the mouth of the}} Meia Ponte River (position; upper, intermediate and lower) were used to evaluate differences in fish assemblage structure, summarized by a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), applied on the abundance data matrix, squared root transformed, to eliminate the effect of abundant species.

Phosphate versus salinity plots show conservative mixing in the Belgian coastal zone from November 2002 until February 2003 and again from July/August onwards. In March, the PO 4 concentration decreases and the chlorophyll a content in the water reaches maximal values in March-April. The DOP concentration is usually low compared to the PO 4 concentration, except in this period. At the more off-shore stations, the dissolved P pool is larger than the particulate P pool. Closer to the coast particulate and dissolved P contribute about equally to the total P, whereas near the mouth of the Scheldt particulate P is the dominant P pool. The % POP of the TPP shows a seasonal trend for the coastal stations with maxima around April. Biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus will be discussed in terms of the relative contribution of biological versus inorganic processes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present {{investigation}} evaluated {{the capacity of}} the Salmonella mutagenicity test, the comet assay, and the micronucleus assay to detect and characterize the genotoxic profile of river sediments. Three stations were selected on an urban river (Bouches du Rhône, France) exposed to various sources of industrial and urban pollution (StA, StB, and StC) and one <b>station</b> on its <b>tributary</b> (StD). One <b>station</b> in a nonurban river was included (REF). The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined by HPLC, and the genotoxicity of the sediments was monitored by the Salmonella mutagenicity test (TA 98 + S 9, YG 1041 ± S 9), the comet assay, and the micronucleus assay on CHO cells. Chemical analysis showed that the total PAH concentrations ranged from 23 μg kg− 1 dw (REF) to 1285 μg kg− 1 dw (StD). All the sediments were mutagenic in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. The mutagenicity was probably induced by the presence of nitroarenes (StA, StB, StC, and StD) and aromatic amines (REF) as deduced from the mutagenicity profiles of strains YG 1041 ± S 9 and TA 98 + S 9. The comet assay revealed direct DNA lesions in REF, StA, and StB sediments and metabolization-dependent DNA damage in StC and StD. The micronucleus assay showed an absence of clastogenicity for StA ± S 9 and StC-S 9, and a significant clastogenicity ± S 9 for the three other stations. The genotoxicity ranking determined by the comet assay + S 9 matched the ranking of total and carcinogenic PAH concentrations, and this assay was found to be the most sensitive...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1952 Presentation date: 1952 - 05 - 10 An {{investigation}} of the fishes of the Willamette River and three of its larger tributaries was made during July, August, September, and November of 1951, to ascertain {{the possibility of using}} them as bio-indices of pollution. Thirteen stations were established on the Willamette River and <b>tributaries.</b> These <b>stations</b> were selected in respect to the major tributaries, cities, and sources of pollution. Two stations were located on the McKenzie river; two on the North Fork of the Santiam River; eight on the main stem of the Willamette River from above Eugene to Oregon City; and one on the Clackamas River. Fishes were collected at each station by means of a seine. The fishes were preserved in a 10 percent formalin solution and returned to Corvallis where they were classified as to species and the numbers of each recorded. Stomach analysis were performed on a portion of the fishes collected from each of the stations. In an attempt to determine the affect of pollution on the fishes of an area, the samples from a clean-water station were compared with those taken from a polluted station. From this survey a tentative list of fishes which were sensitive, intermediate and tolerant to pollution was formed. In general, the trout, salmon, whitefishes and sculpins were found to be sensitive; falcate dace, white crappie, smallmouth black bass, mountain suckers, and longnosed dace were intermediate; and redsided shiner, blacksided dace, coarse-scaled sucker, three-spined stickle back, squawfish, bullhead catfish, chiselmouth, largemouth black bass, Columbia River chub, and larvae of the Pacific lamprey were tolerant. It was found that even the most tolerant fishes disappeared when pollution was excessive. In addition to the biological data collected at each station, certain chemical and physical tests were also determined. Air and water temperatures were taken, along with hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), and dissolved oxygen content of the water. Bio-chemical oxygen demand (B. O. D.) readings were taken at some of the stations by the Oregon State Sanitary Authority. River flow measurements were obtained from U. S. G. S. records for the gage at Salem, Oregon. The physical and chemical tests were used in conjunction with the biological findings to determine the condition of each station. Water flow data was used to determine low water periods. Chemical, physical and water flow data are shown in table form as well as graphically. The numbers of each species of fish and the food organisms found by stomach analysis are listed for each monthly sample and these data are also shown in table form. According to observations from this survey there was a definite indication that pollution can be detected by using the species, numbers and stomach contents of fishes from a waterway...|$|R
40|$|The Nyando River {{is one of}} {{the major}} Rivers in the Lake Victoria Basin. It drains parts of Nandi, Kericho and Nyando districts. It has a {{catchment}} area of about 3600 km− 2 of Western Kenya and an average discharge of approximately 15 m 3 s− 1 , and has within it some of the most severe problems of environmental degradation and deepening poverty found anywhere in Kenya. The Nyando River drains into the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria and is a major contributor of sediment. The primary role of GIS in hydrological modeling is to integrate the ever increasing volumes of diverse spatial and non spatial data. This can be the model input or output. Recent advance in GIS (hardware and software) technology offer unprecedented capabilities for storing and manipulating large quantities of detailed, spatially-distributed watershed data (ASCE, 1999). SWAT, which is an interface of Arc View GIS, uses Arc View to prepare input data and display the model output as spatial maps, charts or time series data. This makes it easy to study and display the information for assimilation by SWAT. SWAT is a continuous time model that operates on a daily/sub-daily time step. It is physically based and can operate on large basins for long periods of time (Arnold et al., 1998). The basic model inputs are rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, land cover, soil and elevation (DEM). The watershed is subdivided into sub-basins that are spatially related to one another. Routing in stream channel is divided in to Water, Sediment, nutrients and organic chemical routing (Neitsch et al., 2002 a). Stream flow data was available for two Stations 1 GD 03 and 1 GD 07. The stations had data ranging from 1950 to 1997, though they had missing gaps. Rainfall data were available for twelve rainfall recording stations in and around the basin. The collected data ranges between 1960 and 2000 though there were quite a number of missing data. The other weather data used were temperature data (maximum and minimum) for Kericho and Kisumu Meteorological stations. During the study the available water capacity (SOL_AWC) was varied within the range of &plusmn; 0. 05 mm of water/mm of soil. The result showed that SOL_AWC affects the stream flow. SOL_AWC affects both the surface flow and base flow. An increase in SOL_AWC results in decrease on the stream flow because of increase in the ability of the soil to hold more water. An increase in the initial curve number (CN 2) increases the stream flow, but the effect is more pronounced on the effects on surface run off. The slightly increase in total stream flow could be as a result of ration of surface run off to base flow. The amount of stream flow contributed by the base flow was more than 50 % of the total stream flow as show by base flow separation. The goodness of fit between observed and simulated stream flow was assessed for the aforementioned (1 GD 03) station, the R 2 was found to be 0. 24 while the NSE was 0. 46 respectively. The low value of R 2 and NSE could be attributed to lots of data gaps in the station and also the effects of combined <b>tributaries.</b> The <b>station</b> is located about 10 km upstream of Ahero Bridge just before the flood plain. The model over estimated the low flows at this station while the high flows were well estimated. The performance of the model varied depending on the available input data. The coefficient of determination R 2 varies for observed and simulated stream flow at River gauging Station. The relationship between land use/cover change and stream flow is very significant in Nyando basin. The observation made is that with decreased Forest Cover up to 0 % there is increased stream flow mean and peak and increased forests cover i. e. 100 % results in decreased mean and peak stream flow...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{water quality}} in Camp Far West Reservoir from October 2001 through August 2003. The reservoir, located at approximately 300 {{feet above sea}} level {{in the foothills of the}} northwestern Sierra Nevada, California, is a monomictic lake characterized by extreme drawdown in the late summer and fall. Thermal stratification in summer and fall is coupled with anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Water-quality sampling was done at approximately 3 -month intervals on eight occasions at several stations in the reservoir, including a group of three stations along a flow path in the reservoir: an upstream station in the Bear River arm (principal <b>tributary),</b> a mid-reservoir <b>station</b> in the thalweg (pre-reservoir river channel), and a station in the deepest part of the reservoir, in the thalweg near Camp Far West Dam. <b>Stations</b> in other <b>tributary</b> arms of the reservoir included those in the Rock Creek arm of the reservoir, a relatively low-flow tributary, and the Dairy Farm arm, a small tributary that receives acidic, metal-rich drainage seasonally from the inactive Dairy Farm Mine, which produced copper, zinc, and gold from underground workings and a surface pit. Several water-quality constituents varied significantly by season at all sampling stations, including major cations and anions, total mercury (filtered and unfiltered samples), nitrogen (ammonia plus organic), and total phosphorus. A strong seasonal signal also was observed for the sulfur-isotope composition of aqueous sulfate from filtered water. Although there were some spatial differences in water quality, the seasonal variations were more profound. Concentrations of total mercury (filtered and unfiltered water) were highest during fall and winter; these concentrations decreased at most stations during spring and summer. Anoxic conditions developed in deep parts of the reservoir during summer and fall in association with thermal stratification. The highest concentrations of methylmercury in unfiltered water were observed in samples collected during summer from deep-water stations in the anoxic hypolimnion. In the shallow (less than 14 meters depth) oxic epilimnion, concentrations of methylmercury in unfiltered water were highest during the spring and lowest during the fall. The ratio of methylmercury to total mercury (MeHg/HgT) increased systematically from winter to spring to summer, largely in response to the progressive seasonal decrease in total mercury concentrations, but also to some extent because of increases in MeHg concentrations during summer. Water-quality data for Camp Far West Reservoir are used in conjunction with data from linked studies of sediment and biota to develop and refine a conceptual model for mercury methylation and bioaccumulation in the reservoir and the lower Bear River watershed. It is hypothesized that MeHg is produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the anoxic parts of the water column and in shallow bed sediment. Conditions were optimal for this process during late summer and fall. Previous work has indicated that Camp Far West Reservoir is a phosphate-limited system—molar ratios of inorganic nitrogen to inorganic phosphorus in filtered water were consistently greater than 16 (the Redfield ratio), sometimes by orders of magnitude. Therefore, concentrations of orthophosphate were expectedly very low or below detection at all stations during all seasons. It is further hypothesized that iron-reducing bacteria facilitate release of phosphorus from iron-rich sediments during summer and early fall, stimulating phytoplankton growth in the fall and winter, and that the MeHg produced in the hypolimnion and metalimnion is released to the entire water column in the late fall during reservoir destratification (vertical mixing). Mercury bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were computed using data from linked studies of biota spanning a range of trophic position: zooplankton, midge larvae, mayfly nymphs, crayfish, threadfin shad, bluegill, and spotted bass. Significant increases in total mercury in tissue with increasing organism size were observed for all three fish species and for crayfish. The BAF values were computed using the average methylmercury concentration (wet) in biota divided by the arithmetic mean concentration of methylmercury in filtered water (0. 04 nanograms per liter). As expected, the BAF values increased systematically with increasing trophic position. Values of BAF were 190, 000 for zooplankton; 470, 000 to 930, 000 for three taxa of invertebrates; 2. 7 million for threadfin shad (whole body); 4. 2 million for bluegill (fillet); and 10 million for spotted bass (fillet). The BAF values are high compared with those for biota in other reservoirs in northern California and elsewhere, indicating relatively efficient biomagnification of mercury in Camp Far West Reservoir...|$|R
