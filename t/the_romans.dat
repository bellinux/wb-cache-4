5|$|Nabis {{also made}} his own preparations. Nabis had always been on good terms with Cretan leaders and he {{requested}} 1,000 of their best soldiers who were hand picked to assist him. As well as the Cretans, he hired 3,000 mercenaries and 10,000 citizens. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> and their allies then advanced upon Sellasia not far north of Sparta. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> were defeated in a small battle and they retreated. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> then won another battle against the Spartans and forced them to retreat into the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic is a study of <b>the</b> ancient <b>Roman</b> Republic that traces <b>the</b> {{progression}} of <b>Roman</b> political development from the founding of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic in 509 BC until the founding of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire in 27 BC. The constitutional history of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic {{can be divided into}} five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic, and thus created <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the {{history of the}} republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the struggle between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|R
5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members had {{remained}} under Spartan occupation and persuaded <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> agreed with the Achaeans, as they did not want a strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> left Greece.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> did not, however, remove Nabis {{from the}} Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a {{landlocked}} and effectively powerless state, <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> wanted an independent Sparta {{to act as}} a counterweight against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured {{by the fact that he}} had to surrender five hostages, amongst them his son, Armenas. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.|$|E
50|$|Over <b>the</b> years, <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> {{constitution}} continuously evolved.

By 27 BC, the Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic had transformed into the Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire. By 300 AD, the Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire had been reformed into the Constitution of <b>the</b> Late <b>Roman</b> Empire. <b>The</b> actual changes, however, were quite gradual. Together, these four constitutions formed four epochs in the continuous evolution of one master constitution.|$|R

5|$|The {{structural}} {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> military describes <b>the</b> major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> armed forces. <b>The</b> <b>Roman</b> military was split into <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> army and <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> navy, although these two branches were less distinct than {{they tend to}} be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> had {{a greater}} {{appreciation}} for the color green; it {{was the color of}} Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> {{spent the}} next two days {{scouting}} the surrounding area and on the third day they met the Galatian army consisting of 50,000 men. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> started the battle by attacking with their skirmishers. The Galatian centre shattered at the first attack and fled {{in the direction of the}} camp. The flanks stood their grounds for longer but were eventually forced to retreat. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> chased them, plundered the Galatian camp as the surviving Galatians fled across the river to join the women, children and the Trocmi.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, {{was much}} {{longer and more}} serious for both <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> and Samnites. The {{fortunes}} of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. But <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|E

5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.

5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy {{was by no means}} assured. The Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes {{had begun}} invading Italy {{from the north}} as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena {{from the north and}} attacked the town of Clusium, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed {{by the size of the}} enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off.|$|E

5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes were invading Italy {{from the}} north as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. <b>The</b> <b>Romans</b> were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence.
