[...] "The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations", he writes, [...] "was by asserting his total control {{over the fate of}} the Jews in the Reich and the east, and [...] cow other interested parties into <b>toeing</b> the line of the RSHA".|$|E

As the political crisis deepened in March, many Bengali officers of the Pakistan Armed Forces looked to Bengali politicians for guidance and Osmani coordinated the clandestine meetings. Bengali military officers, alarmed by the buildup of Pakistani forces and concerned about their own safety, maintained contact with Rahman; some maintained contact with Awami League leaders through Osmani, who reportedly agreed to coordinate the activities of Bengali units. <b>Toeing</b> the party line, he advised the officers (including M.

2500|$|On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt had officially cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said {{it took the}} decision to cut {{diplomatic ties}} due to Qatar’s “embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region”, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom’s eastern province of Qatif. Islam Hassan argues [...] "Starting from 2000 and ahead, Qatar has been pursuing an independent foreign policy that at times clash with the Saudi strategic interests in the region. The fact that Qatar has not been <b>toeing</b> the Saudi foreign policy, and dealing with states and non-state actors that the Saudis do not approve of have caused this tension in relations {{over the past couple}} of years, mainly after the Arab uprisings. This tension was revived by the hacking saga of Qatar News Agency and the statement that was attributed to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, which Qatar falsified later. This happened at a time Mohamed bin Salman is facing competition from Mohamed bin Nayef over the Saudi throne. Mohamed bin Salman tried to have the US blessing during Trump's visit to Saudi to force Qatar to its knees and go back home with a win that would give him more popularity in Saudi Arabia, easing his journey to power. With regards to UAE, there has been always competition between al-Nahyans of Abu Dhabi and al-Thanis of Qatar. This competition goes back to the 1800s. The Arab uprisings ushered a new chapter in the Qatari-Emirati competition. The competition led to the Emiratis playing a major role in the withdrawal of ambassadors from Qatar in 2014. At the beginning of the current diplomatic crisis, particularly after the hacking saga, UAE was trying to maintain the problem. Yet, Aljazeera's publishing of Yousuf al-Otaiba's leaked emails got the UAE on board with Saudi Arabia. Insofar as Bahrain is concerned, the small Kingdom has been <b>toeing</b> the Saudi foreign policy for the past couple of years. It seems that their severing of ties with Qatar was mainly an answer to a Saudi call." ...|$|E

The baying of the hounds inspirited us now and then, but {{presently}} we lost it. Teague said they had gone over the ridge and as soon as we got up to the top we would hear them again. We struck an elk trail with fresh elk tracks in it. Teague said they were just ahead of us. I never climbed so hard and fast in my life.

60|$|Though K'dunk {{had many}} {{interesting}} traits, which we discovered with amazement {{as the summer}} progressed and we grew better acquainted, I think that his feeding ways and tricks were {{the source of our}} most constant delight and wonder. Just to see him stalk a fly filled one with something of the tense excitement of a deer hunt. As he sat by a stump or clod in the fading light, some belated fly or early night-bug would light on {{the ground in front of}} him. Instantly the jewel eye in K'dunk's head would begin to flash and sparkle. He would crouch down and creep nearer, <b>toeing</b> in like a duck, slower and slower, one funny little paw brushing cautiously by the other, with all the stealth and caution of a cat stalking a chipmunk on the wall. Then, as he neared his game, there would be a bright flash of the jewel; a red streak shot through the air, so quick that your eye could not follow it, and the fly would disappear. Whereupon K'dunk would gulp something down, closing his eyes solemnly as he did so, as if he were saying grace, or as if, somehow, closing his eyes to all outward things made the morsel taste better.|$|E
6000|$|Blue-eyed ivy, [...] "garden-spruce," [...] {{and mint}} ran riot over the sunken graves. Blueberry bushes grew lavishly in the sandy corner {{next to the}} fir wood. The varying fashions of tombstones for three generations were to be found there, from the flat, oblong, red {{sandstone}} slabs of old settlers, down through the days of weeping willows and clasped hands, to the latest monstrosities of tall [...] "monuments" [...] and draped urns.

But when he died she did not dare to doom him to a lonely grave in the Presbyterian graveyard over-harbour. His people were all buried in the Methodist cemetery; so Alec Davis went back to his own in death and his widow consoled herself by erecting a monument which cost more than any of the Methodists could afford. The Meredith children hated it, without just knowing why, but they loved the old, flat, bench-like stones with the tall grasses growing rankly about them. They made jolly seats for one thing. They were all sitting on one now. Jerry, tired of leap frog, was playing on a jew's-harp. Carl was lovingly poring over a strange beetle he had found; Una was trying to make a doll's dress, and Faith, leaning back on her slender brown wrists, was swinging her bare feet in lively time to the jew's-harp.|$|E
