The {{position}} in the Greek mind of Hermes as the lord of cloud is, however, more mystic and ideal than {{that of any other}} deity, just on account of the constant and real presence of the cloud itself under different forms, giving rise to all kinds of minor fables. The play of the Greek imagination in this direction is so wide and complex, that I cannot give you an outline of its range in my present limits. There is first a great series of storm-legends connected with the family of the historic Æolus centralized by the story of Athamas, with his two wives, [...] "the Cloud," [...] and the [...] "White Goddess," [...] ending in that of Phrixus and Helle, and of the golden fleece (which is only the cloud-burden of Hermes Eriophoros). With this, there is the fate of Salmoneus, and the destruction of the Glaucus by his own horses; all these minor myths of storm concentrating themselves darkly into the legend of Bellerophon and the Chimæra, in which there is an under story about the vain subduing of passion and treachery, and the end of life in fading melancholy,--which, I hope, not many of you could understand even were I to show it you (the merely physical meaning of the Chimæra is the cloud of volcanic lightning connected wholly with earth-fire, but resembling the heavenly cloud in its height and its thunder). Finally, in the Æolic group, there is the legend of Sisypus, which I mean to work out thoroughly by itself; its root is in the position of Corinth as ruling the isthmus and the two seas --the Corinthean Acropolis, two thousand feet high, being the centre of the crossing currents of the winds, and of the commerce of Greece. Therefore, Athena, and the fountain-cloud Pegasus, are more closely connected with Corinth than even with Athens in their material, though not in their moral, power; and Sisyphus founds the Isthmian games in connection with a melancholy story about the sea gods; but he himself is 'kerdotos andron', the most [...] "gaining" [...] and subtle of men; who having the key of the Isthmus, becomes the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit,</b> transfer, or trade, as such; and of the apparent gain from it, which is not gain; and this is the real meaning of his punishment in hell--eternal toil and recoil (the modern idol of capital being, indeed, the stone of Sisyphus with a vengeance, crushing in its recoil). But, throughout, the old ideas of the cloud power and cloud feebleness,--the deceit of its hiding,--and the emptiness of its banishing,--the Autolycus enchantment of making black seem white,--and the disappointed fury of Ixion (taking shadow for power), mingle in the moral meaning of this and its collateral legends; and give an aspect, at last, not only of foolish cunning, but of impiety or literal [...] "idolatry," [...] "imagination worship," [...] to the dreams of avarice and injustice, until this notion of atheism and insolent blindness becomes principal; and the [...] "Clouds" [...] of Aristophanes, with the personified [...] "just" [...] and [...] "unjust" [...] sayings {{in the latter part of}} the play, foreshadow, almost feature by feature, in all that they were written to mock and to chastise, the worst elements of the impious [...] "'dinos'" [...] and tumult in men's thoughts, which have followed on their avarice in the present day, making them alike forsake the laws of their ancient gods, and misapprehended or reject the true words of their existing teachers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Traffic flow {{in major}} urban roads is {{affected}} by several factors. It is often interrupted by stochastic conditions, such as traffic lights, road conditions, number of vehicles on the road, time of travel, weather conditions, driving style of vehicles. The provision of timely and accurate travel time information of transit vehicles is valuable for both operators and passengers, especially when dispatching is based on estimation of potential passengers waiting along the route rather than the predefined time schedule. Operators manage their dispatches in real time, and passengers can form travel preferences dynamically. Arrival time estimation for time scheduled public transport busses have been studied by many researchers using various paradigms. However, dynamic prediction on some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> vehicles, which do not follow any dispatch time schedule, or stop station constrains introduces extra complexities. In this paper, a survey on the recent studies using historical data, statistical methods, Kalman Filters and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been applied to GPS data collected from transit vehicles, are collected {{with an emphasis on}} their model and architecture...|$|E
40|$|Public {{transportation}} {{stands a}} very important role in the modern society. It solves many transportation problems, reduces the negative impacts of motor vehicles to the environment, and brings benefit and mobility to everyone. Public transportation models are used in urban area transit networks in order to predict the future impacts of the traffic policy and changes. Models in public transportation simulation are extensively studied in the literature, but very few have compared all the available models to a traffic data to find which model is the most accurate one in simulating a transit network. This study provides an overview of some of the available approaches in public transportation modeling, describes how they work by both theoretical review and examples. On the analysis, the modeling results from each model are compared with the Stockholm traffic data. The Stockholm traffic data of average weighted travel time, travel distance, in-vehicle travel distance and number of transfers are extracted from the RES 05 / 06 survey data. The model which provides modeling outputs with least root mean square error compared to the survey data is found. This study could give an initial suggestion for the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> modeling in choosing the appropriate model and finding the direction for calibrating the parameter settings through our proposed comparison measures. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} various {{methods of}} providing transit services in low-density areas. These areas {{can be classified}} into two major categories. First, suburban areas of medium and large cities; and second, entire medium and small cities which have low population densities. One {{of these types of}} areas is found in most cities. The focus of this study is the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> network and operation in which special transit centers are organized at which vehicles from several different lines converge at the same time, enabling passengers to transfer between any two lines, and then depart in their respective directions. This type of service is called timed transfer system, or TTS. Thus instead of individual transit lines, usually with inconvenient transfers in low density areas, TTS represents a coordinated transit network which passengers can utilize for travel between any two points in the served area with reasonable convenience and average travel speed. To provide a thorough description and analysis of TTS, and to define precisely its role in urban areas, this study first presents a systematic review of various types of transit services, networks and methods of operation, defining characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of each one.

40|$|The main {{transportation}} {{issues facing}} cities today fall into familiar categories [...] congestion and public transit. For congestion, {{there is now}} a far richer menu of options that are understood, technically feasible, and perhaps politically feasible. One can now contemplate offering roads of different qualities and prices. Many selected road segments are now operated by the private sector. Road pricing is routinely considered in planning exercises, and field experiments have made it more familiar to urban voters. Concerns about environmental effects of urban trucking have resulted in serious interest in tolled truck-only express highways. As for public transit, {{there is a need for}} political mechanisms to allow each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> to specialize where it is strongest. The spread of â€œbus rapid transitâ€ has opened new possibilities for providing the advantages of rail transit at lower cost. The prospect of pricing and privatizing highway facilities could reduce the amount of subsidy needed to maintain a healthy transit system. Privately operated public transit is making a comeback in other parts of the world. The single most positive step toward better urban transportation would be to encourage the spread of road pricing. A second step, more speculative because it has not been researched, would be to use more environmentally-friendly road designs that provide needed capacity but at modest speeds, and that would not necessarily serve all vehicles.

40|$|Neurogenesis in {{the adult}} {{hippocampus}} is a highly regulated process that originates from multipotent progenitors in the subgranular zone (SGZ). Currently, {{little is known about}} molecular mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation in the SGZ. To study the role of transcription factors (TFs), we focused on Tbr 2 (T-box brain gene 2), which has been implicated previously in developmental glutamatergic neurogenesis. In adult mouse hippocampus, Tbr 2 protein and Tbr 2 -GFP (green fluorescent protein) transgene expression were specifically localized to intermediate-stage progenitor cells (IPCs), a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> amplifying cells. The Tbr 2 + IPCs were highly responsive to neurogenic stimuli, more than doubling after voluntary wheel running. Notably, the Tbr 2 + IPCs formed cellular clusters, the average size of which (Tbr 2 + cells per cluster) likewise more than doubled in runners. Conversely, Tbr 2 + IPCs were selectively depleted by antimitotic drugs, known to suppress neurogenesis. After cessation of antimitotic treatment, recovery of neurogenesis was paralleled by recovery of Tbr 2 + IPCs, including a transient rebound above baseline numbers. Finally, Tbr 2 was examined in the context of additional TFs that, together, define a TF cascade in embryonic neocortical neurogenesis (Pax 6 [->] Ngn 2 [->] Tbr 2 [->] NeuroD [->] Tbr 1). Remarkably, the same TF cascade was found to be linked to stages of neuronal lineage progression in adult SGZ. These results suggest that Tbr 2 + IPCs {{play a major role in}} the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and that a similar transcriptional program controls neurogenesis in adult SGZ as in embryonic cerebral cortex...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Transit buses provide {{transportation}} within {{cities and}} counties. They {{have been involved}} in approximately 284, 000 traffic accidents {{over the past five years}} with an average of 57, 000 buses involved in accidents per year. Traffic Safety Facts reports show that rear impact is the third most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> bus accident, causing deaths and a large number of injuries. Government standards are very limited for crashworthiness of transit buses, and manufacturers have done few studies on crashworthiness of transit buses. Most studies thus have concentrated on frontal impact scenarios, but very little attempt has been made to study rear impacts of transit buses. Physical testing of transit buses to study crashworthiness during rear impacts is costly, and data obtained from testing is limited, therefore, a so finite element (FE) analysis technique is used. A detailed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model was obtained from the manufacturer for a typical 30 -foot-long low-floor mass transit bus. Meshing was done for structural parts of the bus. Proper joints and connection were provided at appropriate locations. Mesh quality was kept superior so that the model could be used for multiple load cases. Material testing was done to obtain strain rate dependent material properties. The model was validated for front and rear bumper slowspeed tests by comparing FE simulation results with physical tests done by the manufacturer according to Standard Bus Procurement Guidelines (SBPG). Also a highspeed side impact simulation was done and validated. The interior of the bus was modeled in detail and then used to carry out a series of FE simulations for different impact velocities.

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the role of}} landscape architecture as the main articulation {{of the community and}} development aspects of a sustainable transit corridor. Indianapolis, Indiana is lacking suitable and sufficient mass transit options. The contemporary proposals for an improved transit system for Indianapolis omitted the use of a mode of transportation that has a long history with the city: the streetcar. Indianapolis has, in recent years, promoted cultural landmarks throughout the city by implementing Cultural District designations and building a "Cultural Trail. " Unfortunately, the city continues to suffer from socioeconomic and cultural disparity. This project addresses the potential development possibilities of a streetcar-based transit corridor to connect several of Indianapolis' Cultural Districts. By examining the problem through a "quadruple-bottom-line" approach, aspects of socioeconomic integration, community development, physical connectivity, and "smart growth" were addressed in this proposal as they relate to transit corridor development. The project began as a comprehensive examination of how a transit corridor could act as a prototype sustainable development to inspire more sustainable development throughout Indianapolis. The supplementary work addressed further investigation into an important gateway site in downtown Indianapolis and specific design elements throughout the corridor. Through research, interviews, and analysis, the location for the corridor and the specific site was established. The proposed transit corridor exists between Broad Ripple Village, Mass Ave., and Fountain Square Cultural Districts. This corridor connects three major cultural landmarks to downtown Indianapolis, as well as offers an efficient, intraurban transit option for local residents (thus expanding the potential area someone could access without a personal vehicle). The research suggested that streetcars are a more effective <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> for building local business and community. By integrating community-focused open spaces along the corridor, the proposed transit route could act as a community incubator and prototype for development throughout Indianapolis. In addition, a site is located in downtown Indianapolis between a proposed IndyGO transit center and a commuter rail station. The site is between Alabama and New Jersey Streets, south of Market Street (in the heart of downtown Indianapolis; three blocks east of Monument Circle). This multi-modal site was designed to be an example of how sustainable design and planning solutions could be applied throughout the system. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

40|$|Revitalization and Rehabilitation Project for SADDAR - KARACHI A {{research}} to formulate alternatives for Revitalization of Saddar and Rehabilitation of its Hawkers, Encroachers and Leased Markets. By Arif Hasan, Asiya Sadiq Polack, Christophe Polack Karachi’s Saddar, once {{the pride of}} the city, is now a mess and becoming worse day by day. It is congested and environmentally degraded. In an attempt to solve its problems, Architect Arif Hasan, Chairman of the Urban Resource Centre (URC), prepared a development plan for Saddar in 1986. The plan included partial pedestrianisation and the rehabilitation of hawkers. When the plan was presented to the hawkers, they rejected it outright as they considered it an attack on their livelihoods. In the mid-’ 90, the URC carried out surveys in an attempt to understand the sociology and economy of the Saddar hawkers. Based on this understanding a research has been carried out by architects Arif Hasan, Asiya Sadiq Polack, Christophe Polack and researchers Muhammad Jameel and Muhammad Nazeer, both of the URC. The outcome of the research is an analysis of Saddar’s degradation, documentation of the existing situation and proposals for a rehabilitation plan along with financial and institutional details for its implementation and sustainability. The study was carried out in consultation with Mr. Malik Zaheerul Islam Director of the Transport and Communication Department and other concerned government officials. An introduction of the ongoing work was made to the previous City Government (formerly known as KMC) in 2001 and in 2002 to the present Karachi city and Saddar town nazims. A more elaborate presentation will be made to them in the coming weeks. It is hoped that the study will help the city government in its attempts to overcome the problems of Karachi’s Saddar. Background to the area of Study Saddar Bazaar area was once considered to be the cultural hub of Karachi. It was the geographic, economic and socio-cultural centre of Karachi and it was cherished by the citizens for its exquisite architecture, environment and services. In the last 30 years the culture of Saddar and its environs has changed dramatically due to the influence of an enormous population increase and resultant growth of the city. Saddar being centrally located in Karachi has turned into the largest transit area, catering to thousands of buses, other public transport vehicles and the commuting population. Surveys on schoolchildren and policemen point out that the lead content in blood has reached alarming levels and many psychiatric ailments in the area have proven to be directly linked with noise and air pollution. Many of the residential buildings having retail shops on the ground floor have been replaced by godowns and storage spaces or are lived in by male day wage labourers. This has obviously changed the character of the streets from lively down town shopping to deserted and unfriendly at night. More then 3000 semi-permanent cabins, hawkers and vendors catering to the transit population have sprung up lining almost all the streets in Saddar. They are a product of the process in which the mafia, supported by corrupt officials, form a party to extort money from them. The hawkers and encroachers pay to middlemen, known as ‘beaters’. These beaters are in touch with the hawkers’ associations on daily basis for collecting the bribe money (bhatta) which is proportionate to the commercial value of the encroached piece of land. In turn for the ‘bhatta’ provided, they keep their eyes closed to the activities of the hawkers and encroachers. Operation clean-ups and regular evictions are carried out to help keep the status quo. There are no attempts to regularise the hawkers and encroachers as it means loosing an easy source of income. Moreover, due to Saddar’s new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> clientele, there is a genuine demand for hawkers and encroachers, which promotes their growth and interest in the area. Saddar, being the geographical centre of the city {{and in the absence of}} a ring road, became the place where the interchange of buses had to occur. According to a recent survey done by the former Traffic Engineering Bureau (TEB), approximately 3, 50, 000 buses, mini-buses and cars are entering and exiting Saddar daily, which is an increase of 40. 7 percent in the last 6 years. This excludes all other modes of transport such as, bicycles, motorbikes, donkey and horse driven carts. No proper bus terminal has been allocated or provided in Saddar although transporters have been requesting it for many years. The ad-hoc bus terminal near Empress Market is a result of this. Secondly, the bus drivers, being under the influence of the power which is exerted by their owners, pick up or drop passengers anywhere along their route, sometimes stopping in the street far from the curb disturbing traffic or causing accidents. Myths and realities concerning hawkers, vendors and encroachments The middle and lower income groups visiting Saddar have a cultural and economic need in them. Hawkers and vendors provide services as well as entertainment to the transit and shopping population. For the lower income people, shops hold very little attraction due to their formal nature and high prices. They visit Saddar primarily for shopping from the hawker’s or just for an outing. Saddar still offers more than shopping possibilities for its regular visitors. The cultural aspect of wandering and browsing through merchandise, leafing through a newspaper, sitting with a palmist, having the shoes polished add flavour to the trip made by a regular visitor. Standing and applauding the medicine man, who is selling to a large audience by putting on an act provides a source of entertainment as well as parallel medicine to the lower income groups. In addition, the large variety of cheap food items, available with hawkers, is an added attraction to the visitors. The labourers, shopkeepers and office employees working in Saddar or in transit also use these eateries for their daily afternoon meals Old hawkers are usually those, who have been working in Saddar for the past 2 to 3 generations. They occupy the first row along the footpaths by de-facto status. New hawkers and encroachers are often recent arrivals in Saddar, usually employed by the police and city government officials to run their businesses. They usually occupy the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th row on the streets on the basis of official support. There are many hawkers, encroachers and shopkeepers’ organisations working for the social welfare and security of their respective members. However, they are not technically equipped nor organised enough to hold talks for rehabilitation with the government. These organisations charge a fee of between Rs. 50 - 100 per month per member. This money is used to pay guards at night who watch over the parked carts or locked cabins. It is also used for paying the sweepers who manage the solid waste and sometimes it is given as a welfare loan to hawkers, encroachers and shopkeepers in need of financial assistance. Contrary to the popular belief that shopkeepers cannot coexist with hawkers, being their competitors, an informal working relationship has been discovered. Hawkers serve as a source of attraction for their potential clients. When people see a large number of other people in front of the shops they are attracted to the liveliness and activity. Secondly, hawkers often sell products of the shops, at a slightly lower price but sharing the profit with the shopkeepers. This, of course, with the exception of upmarket shops or service based institutions such as jewellers, banks and upmarket restaurants who would much rather get rid of any form of encroachment in front of their premises. It is also a misconception that hawkers and vendors contribute to the littering of Saddar with solid waste. Although, part generators of both organic and inorganic waste, solid waste collection and disposal at street level is well taken care of by hawkers’ associations, hawkers, encroachers and shop keepers of leased markets. It does not, in any way, add to the environmental degradation of Saddar. The heaps of garbage, which are usually seen lying around, are a result of bad management and disposal at area level by the city government. Extensive interviews have been held with hawkers, encroachers and leased markets as well as the shoppers they serve. 86 Percent of the shoppers buying from them is in transit and do not have the time to go into the shops. This is also why cross sections and main roads are most attractive for hawkers, as there, they are visible to the pedestrian traffic. The poverty level of hawkers, encroachers and shopkeepers is not as high as expected, however, being evicted several times a month is not contributing to the stability of the financially weak. At an average hawkers and encroachers earn a net income of Rs. 100 per day. The remaining earnings of Rs. 200 is spent on the purchase of goods, bribes, storage and security of carts, association fee’s, solid waste disposal and transport. As long as a bus interchange in Saddar will remain, the need for hawkers will remain as well. Being an active part of the economy of Karachi, hawkers and encroachers are interested in lease, permit or any type of legal document, which would grant them security of tenure. In July 2001, 20 hawkers belonging to the Preedy Hawkers’ association came together and applied to the KMC for regularisation and permits for a permanent cabin. Once the money was deposited they were allotted 20 cabins. The other members of the organisation were encouraged by this attempt and within 2 months, 3000 more hawkers had applied to the association for regularisation. However, no further rehabilitation could take place as after 14 th August 2001, KMC ceased to exist and the new City Government revoked the previous orders and evicted all of them by force without returning the payments. The hawkers showed resistance on which they were threatened and asked to pay bribes by some of the officials. The Hawkers associations have lost all trust in the government agencies but understand that there is no other way out. They are not technically equipped to neither make alternative plans for rehabilitation nor negotiate with the government. They request the City Government to issue the permit or lease in advance. The same goes for the construction of new shops and related services in appropriate areas, which should be handed over before vacating the existing ones. The negotiation over this demand and its acceptance would be essential in order to reinstate a sense of trust in the hawkers, encroachers and shop keepers of leased markets vis a vis the city government for the success of the proposed scheme. Legalizing the hawkers and encroachers will also give an opportunity to the City Government to have control on their number. Traffic Planning and Management is closely related to the hawkers phenomena and is a planning issue to be dealt with on city scale. Saddar being the geographic centre of Karachi and serving the main living and work areas, any change in it, affects the larger traffic patterns of the city and vice versa. Also the sheer number of people living and working in the city and its increase in the past 50 years play a crucial role on their movement pattern. No substantial improvement can be achieved in Saddar before larger issues on City scale have been solved or at least dealt with in a constructive way. The high potential given by professionals to the Northern Bye pass and the Karachi Circular Railway have never really been taken seriously by the various government agencies. A rationalisation of routes and interchanges through a revised bus routing plan on city scale together with the creation of inter and intra-bus terminals is needed in order to reduce the number of vehicles going through Saddar. If a revitalization of the Karachi Circular Railway could be achieved, a simple shuttle service, bicycle and pedestrian access would be needed to connect the Cantonment station to Empress market and Saddar. The major issue which arose out of the study was traffic rerouting as a priority to relieve Saddar from its traffic congestion, making its commuting patterns for the vehicles and pedestrians more efficient and safer. Although officially no public transport vehicle can be on the roads without an official permit, almost 50 percent of the public buses in Karachi do not have a valid permit and each year new buses are added to the numbers. Out of 2282 issued permits only 16 percent of the buses actually terminate in Saddar, while 84 percent of the buses and mini-buses of Karachi are using Saddar as a thoroughfare. With such concentration of transit population and transport, which has no direct interest in the upkeep of Saddar, the idea of Saddar, the traditional and cultural centre of the city seems a far-fetched dream. As a response, a set of ring roads is proposed by the study around Saddar which would help relieving Saddar of through traffic but also improve the commuting efficiency. A ring road for fast-moving cars has been proposed following Abdullah Haroon Road and Mansfield road. Street parking would still be allowed but would only be accessible through a service lane. Similarly, a ring road for fast-moving buses has been proposed along Dr. Daud Pota Road with a left turn on Preedy street and the street along the Students’ Byriani restaurant. To facilitate the segregation of through and local traffic the next step has been the provision of infrastructure catering to transit traffic in the form of a bus terminal which could be located on the site where the weekly Sunday Bazaar is currently held Increasing the number of charged parking places in Saddar and have it operated under the management of the city government would give more revenues than the present system of contractors. Presently approximately 2, 500 parking spaces are available in Saddar. After adopting the proposed traffic re-routing plan this could be increased to 3, 313 parking spaces which would mean a monthly revenue of Rs. 33, 13, 000 to the City Government. The total number of parking spaces required to revitalise retail shopping and make Saddar more accessible cannot only be accommodated in streets. It will also require the provision of single and multi-storied parking lots. In 1986, 32 potential sites for multi storied- parkings lots and bus terminals have been selected by the former Traffic Engineering Bureau but due to various reasons none of these have been implemented. Relocation of Hawkers, Encroachers and leased markets. In the absence of pedestrian areas in Saddar, thousands of pedestrians are forced to mix with the vehicular traffic (100, 000 pedestrians cross Preedy Street everyday). Because of the encroachments on the footpath these pedestrian have no other choice then to risk their lives on the streets. Therefore, pedestrian zones have been provided with vendor stalls to complement the two activities. An overall connection with the bus terminal and bus stops has been established. The proposed pedestrian areas consist of Bohri Bazaar and portions of Zaibunissa Street, Sharah-e-Iraq, Dr. Daud Pota Road and Preedy street (refer map for details). Additional to this, some of the leased markets will be relocated on the land reserved for the Preedy Street extension. This location has been chosen due its close vicinity to both the proposed bus terminal and Empress Market which on their turn form the main attraction for the transit population. The proposals of the study have suggested that a transparent process of rehabilitation will have to be held through dialogues, mobilisation of the stakeholders and incremental development. Only this can ensure that all spatial and socio-economic concerns are addressed and provide a more realistic platform for the revitalization of Saddar and the rehabilitation of its hawkers and encroachers.   Photo 1 : Traffic congestion on Mansfield Street Photo 2 : Traffic and hawkers on Preedy Street Photo 3 : Hawkers on Preedy Street Photo 4 : Condition of Preedy Street extension All photographs taken by Arif Hasan & Partners/URC Table 1 : List of Average Earning and Expenditures of Hawkers Earning	Expenditures	Net Income for House Hold p. d 	p. m.
