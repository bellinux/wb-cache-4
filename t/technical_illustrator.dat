After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his studio. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter.

40|$|Current {{interactive}} modeling systems allow {{users to}} view models in wireframe or Phong-shaded images. However, the wireframe {{is based on}} the model's parameterization, and a model's features may get lost in a nest of lines. Alone, a fully rendered image may not provide enough useful information about the structure or model features. Human <b>technical</b> <b>illustrators</b> follow certain visual conventions that are unlike Phong-shaded or wireframe renderings, and the drawings they produce are subjectively superior to conventional computer renderings. This thesis explores lighting, shading, and line illustration conventions used by <b>technical</b> <b>illustrators.</b> These conventions are implemented in a modeling system to create a new method of displaying and viewing complex NURBS models.

40|$|For a long time, {{artists and}} <b>technical</b> <b>illustrators</b> have used textures made of small 2 D elements, {{arranged}} in a repetitive fashion.

There is still a difficult trade off between the control given over this automation and the user-friendliness of this control. In addition, the sudden increase of available input data and of the number of specific needs for texture generation casts doubt on the “one application, one method ” approach. We present a domain-specific language for making programmable description of 2 D vector elements arrangements.

5000|$|In {{physical}} models, these greebles {{could be}} anything from parts of plastic cut to an interesting shape, or actual elements taken from shop-bought model kits. For instance, in Star Wars the original Imperial Star Destroyer was constructed from a plywood frame and adorned with sheet styrene. Panel lines were cut into the sheet styrene, but essentially that left the ship looking extremely bare. Hundreds of model kits were purchased and the model department promptly cut apart pieces of the model kits and stuck them, along with more sheet styrene, to the surfaces of the ship. The ultimate effect {{was to make the}} ship appear more believable to the viewer through the addition of these large areas of ancillary details. The greebles themselves served no purpose other than to fill space and individually had no definite function to the design of the ship, although later each greeble was given a specific function by either fans or <b>technical</b> <b>illustrators</b> for fan guides.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} {{for which it}} is necessary to illustrate motion in a static image using visual cues which do not represent a physical entity in the scene, yet are widely understood to convey motion. For example, consider the task of illustrating the desired movements for exercising, dancing, or a given sport technique. Traditional artists have developed techniques to specify desired movements precisely (<b>technical</b> <b>illustrators)</b> and suggest motion (cartoonists) in an image. In this paper, we present an interactive system to synthesize a 2 D image of an animated character by generating artist-inspired motion cues derived from 3 D skeletal motion capture data. The primary cues include directed arrows, noise waves, and stroboscopic motion. First, the user decomposes the animation into short sequences containing individual motions which can be represented by visual cues. The system then allows the user to determine a suitable viewpoint for illustrating the movement, to select the proper level in the joint hierarchy, as well as to fine-tune various controls for the depiction of the cues themselves. While the system does provide adapted default values for each control, extracted from the motion capture data, it allows fine-tuning for greater expressiveness. Moreover, these cues are drawn in real time, and maintain a coherent display with changing viewpoints. We demonstrate the benefit of our interactive system on various motion capture sequences...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} interdisciplinarity has become popular in recent years, {{not only in}} art practice, which has long been using {{combinations}} of ideas and media, {{but also in the}} more traditionally academic fields. Discipline boundaries have begun to dissolve, with research increasingly based on issues and specific questions, rather than the disciplines themselves. Collaborative projects are emerging, and scientists are more and more turning to contemporary art practice for new insights. With increasing confidence in art as a research process, combinations such as Arts and Health, or Art and Science, have established a prominent presence in the professional artworld in Ireland and the UK. The degree of freedom and input of the artist in such collaborations is often varied – the artist may act as <b>illustrator,</b> <b>technical</b> advisor, communicator, researcher or theorist. It could be argued by sceptics that there is a danger for artists in these relationships to simply provide the aesthetic facade for the other parties' work.

40|$|While {{literature}} {{in areas of}} constructivism learning theory, use of computer technology in education, and the implementation of project-based learning in the classroom have received widespread attention, there is no reported research that specifically examines the effectiveness of using a project-based learning model for computer technology instruction for pre-service teachers' programs in general, and in art education in particular. Thus, the research problem was to examine through pre- and post-test control-group experimental research design whether two different teaching methods, constructivism teaching approach (project-based learning) and traditional (step-by-step) teaching approach, result in significant differences in learning computer usage, the application of computer technical skills, design projects, and attitudes toward using of technology. The research was conducted at University of North Texas during the fall semester of 2004. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect the data. The quantitative data, collected from a pre-post test and pre and post questionnaire, was analyzed using a t-test. No {{significant difference was found}} between the groups as it relates to computer usage, one aspect of the application of computer technical skills (Photoshop usage), and attitudes towards technology. There was, however, a statistical difference between the groups {{in the use of the}} other aspect of computer application <b>technical</b> skills (<b>Illustrator).</b> The qualitative data was collected from three sources, the final design project, the focus group interview, and the reflective papers and summarized quantitatively. A rubric was used to assess the final design project and the scores from the rubric were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A significant difference was found between the groups as it relates to the assessment of the final project design. The constructivist (project-based learning) group scored higher than the traditional (step-by-step) group. The analysis of the focus group interviews revealed more positive responses for the project-based learning group as opposes to the step-by-step group. The analysis of the reflective papers also revealed more positive responses by the project-based learning group as oppose to the step-by-step group.
