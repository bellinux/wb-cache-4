5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E
25|$|Just as a gun recoils when {{a bullet}} is fired, {{conservation}} of momentum requires a nucleus (such as in a gas) <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> during emission or absorption of a gamma ray. If a nucleus at rest emits a gamma ray, {{the energy of}} the gamma ray is slightly less than the natural energy of the transition, but in order for a nucleus at rest to absorb a gamma ray, the gamma ray's energy must be slightly greater than the natural energy, because in both cases energy is lost <b>to</b> <b>recoil.</b> This means that nuclear resonance (emission and absorption of the same gamma ray by identical nuclei) is unobservable with free nuclei, because the shift in energy is too great and the emission and absorption spectra have no significant overlap.|$|E
25|$|On {{a flimsy}} pretext, a Republican French army invaded Switzerland in January 1798 {{and forced the}} country into an uneasy {{alliance}} marked by occasional revolts. By the start of hostilities with Austria in early 1799, Masséna was {{in command of the}} Army of Helvetia. Going on the offensive, the French inflicted defeats on the Austrians at Maienfeld, Chur and Feldkirch on 6 and 7 March. Ordered to attack Feldkirch in late March by his superior Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, Masséna attacked with troops under Nicolas Oudinot. Jourdan's defeats at Ostrach and Stockach soon forced the French <b>to</b> <b>recoil.</b>|$|E

25|$|In February 1782, Princess Royal Battery was {{the site}} of the first use of Lieutenant George Koehler's {{depressing}} gun-carriage. This allowed the angle of the gun to be aimed down at an angle of seventy degrees. This enabled the defending soldiers {{to take advantage of the}} height of the Rock of Gibraltar. It was ingenius because the sliding carriage allowed the gun <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> without sending the gun carriage into the air. This idea was later built into more conventional gun carriages. Colonel John Drinkwater in his accounts claimed that the gun hit its target 28 times out of 30 when aimed at the Spaniard's San Carlos Battery.|$|E
25|$|Two new 9.2-inch {{guns were}} {{installed}} in 1906 {{in the western}} wing battery. They were mounted on barbettes, enabling them <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> along their axis and so delivering a much faster rate of fire. One 9.2-inch and one 6-inch gun on a disappearing mounting remained in the eastern wing battery before being removed in 1907. During the war the fort {{was used as a}} Battery Command Post operating in conjunction with a Port War Signal Station located to the fort's east, which was responsible for monitoring all shipping entering or leaving the Thames. The remaining two 9.2-inch guns were removed in 1917 and reinstalled at Fletcher Battery, a newly built position on the Isle of Sheppey.|$|E

As Lestat feeds from Nicolas, he is plunged into the darkness in which Nicolas resides. He describes the scene as a seamless black sea, where all colours have faded, and that he sees only a bird soaring over the void expanse. He describes a feeling of having lost all that was once cherished. He describes it also as worse than his moment of darkness at the Inn, and tries <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> from it. He finally turns Nicki into a vampire, which strains their friendship.|$|E

25|$|In 1994 Portishead, a trio {{comprising}} singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released {{their debut}} album Dummy. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs. Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during {{the recording of}} Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music, seen as cutting edge in its film-noir feel and stylish, yet emotional appropriations of past sounds, was also widely imitated, causing the band <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize.|$|E
25|$|Titin {{is a large}} {{abundant}} protein of striated muscle. Titin's primary {{functions are}} to stabilize the thick filament, center it between the thin filaments, prevent overstretching of the sarcomere, and <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> the sarcomere like a spring after it is stretched. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half {{the length of a}} sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Of the many titin variants identified, five are described with complete transcript information available.|$|E

25|$|On 14 June 1807, Marchand led his {{division}} at the Battle of Friedland. Ney's corps formed the right flank, hidden in the Sortlack Wood. At 5:30 PM, Emperor Napoleon ordered a 20-gun battery to fire a salvo, signalling Ney to attack Bennigsen's left flank. As the VI Corps burst from the forest, Marchand took position on the right while Bisson formed to his left. Sweeping Russian light troops before him, Marchand diverged slightly {{to the right to}} push his opponents into the river. This opened a gap between the two divisions, which Russian cavalry tried to exploit. With the help of Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg's cavalry, the enemy horsemen were dispersed. As Ney's troops advanced, they were enfiladed from the opposite bank of the river by a storm of cannon fire. As the soldiers hesitated, Bennigsen hurled a mass of cavalry at Bisson's left flank, causing Ney's corps <b>to</b> <b>recoil.</b> However, Claude Perrin Victor's I Corps arrived to beat back the Russians. This gave Ney and his officers time to rally the VI Corps and repulse the Russian Imperial Guard. At 8:30 PM, the troops of Marchand and Bisson seized Friedland itself.|$|E

[...] An hour later he was dead. One of his regiments while fighting in an interval of the Russian army, was shot down and cut to pieces by the Cossacks; only eighteen of them escaped. General d'Hautpoul, three times forced <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> with his division, thrice rallied them to the charge; the third time, he again rushed on the enemy, crying in a loud voice: [...] "Cuirassiers, forward, in the name of God! forward, my brave cuirassiers!"

2500|$|Nuclei in a solid crystal, however, are {{not free}} <b>to</b> <b>recoil</b> because they are bound {{in place in the}} crystal lattice.

Any whole number of phonons can be emitted, including zero, which is known as a [...] "recoil-free" [...] event. In this case conservation of momentum is satisfied by the momentum of the crystal as a whole, so practically no energy is lost.|$|E
