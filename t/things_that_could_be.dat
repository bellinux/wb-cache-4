Different types of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen within LARPs are; bows, crossbows, siege weapons, thrown weapons, , NERF guns, paintball guns, and Airsoft guns. Ranged weapons can fit into every combat system except the 'No-Touch' system. There are LARPs that are ranged combat only, although {{a majority of the}} rules widely vary, a majority of ranged only LARPs follow the base rule of one hit kill.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{marketing}} {{has been}} criticized for not advertising it as a musical. Michael Halberstam of the Writers' Theatre said, [...] "By de-emphasizing the score to the extent they did in the trailer, it is possible the producers were condescending to us – a tactic which cannot ultimately end in anything but tears." [...] In the UK, a number of audience members walked out of the film on realizing it was a musical, and complaints that advertisements for the film were deliberately misleading were made to both the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards agency. The studios involved opted for a low-key approach to their marketing. Producer Walter Parkes stated, [...] "All these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> described as difficulties could also be the movie's greatest strengths." [...] Warner Bros. felt it should take a similar approach to marketing as with The Departed, with little early exposure and discouraging talk of awards.|$|E
2500|$|The Devil is Sam's father, {{according}} to the Devil throughout the second season. He does many things throughout the series that imply this: he never gets truly angry with Sam, he only gets outwardly angry with him one time where {{he says that he}} is [...] "a disappointment." [...] He often offers guidance to Sam. Plus, he seems to have an extreme dislike of Sam's father. Throughout the series, he and Sam do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> considered 'father-son activities' such as going to hockey games, eating ice cream, and playing baseball together.|$|E

2500|$|Also in the [...] "Ethics", Spinoza {{discusses}} {{his beliefs}} {{about what he}} considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can {{be known as the}} knowledge of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> “mutilated, confused, and without order.” [...] Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state. This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.|$|E
2500|$|Lambert {{demonstrated}} {{these principles}} {{in the only}} way available at the time: by contriving often ingenious optical arrangements that could make two immediately adjacent luminous fields appear equally bright (something {{that could only be}} determined by visual observation), when two physical quantities that produced the two fields were unequal by some specific amount (<b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> directly measured, such as angle or distance). In this way, Lambert quantified purely visual properties (such as luminous power, illumination, transparency, reflectivity) by relating them to physical parameters (such as distance, angle, radiant power, and color). Today, this is known as [...] "visual photometry." [...] Lambert {{was among the first to}} accompany experimental measurements with estimates of uncertainties based on a theory of errors and what he experimentally determined as the limits of visual assessment.|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Galileo Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, Mario Biagioli {{looks to}} shed light on the ways in which a society {{characterized}} by patronage relationships affected one of astronomy’s, and modern science’s, greatest heroes: Galileo Galilei. Biagioli looks to uncover aspects of Galileo’s life by “vividly [...] the pioneer physicist to us through the active social relations he experienced with persons in the different courts with which he was connected.” [...] The book reveals how Galileo “used patronage to obtain his teaching position in Pisa… [...] maneuvered his transfer from Padua to the “home court” of the Medicis… used contacts with Prince Cesi and other well-placed persons in Roman circles to become an Academian, and a person of influence, and how all of this turned to dust for Galileo, when he lost the patronage of Urban VIII, one of his two most special patrons”. In a review of Biagioli’s work, Larry Wolff noted Biagioli as demonstrating Galileo’s legitimacy as a direct consequence of “his ‘career strategies’” and not just “his ‘cognitive attitudes’” and that Galileo is shown to be a master of attaining power and a seventeenth-century career in science [...] The book acknowledges that “gifts within the logic of patronage [...] the role of spectacular scientific production in Galileo’s career… [...] needed to produce or discover <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used as gifts for his patrons” [...] Jardine adds, as Biagioli has shown, Galileo’s gift to Cosimo II of his discovery of the satellites of Jupiter, transformed into emblems of Medici dynastic power, was a spectacularly successful instance. Through exchange of gifts, highly ritualized and often highly competitive, princes and nobles achieved social distinction, maintaining their honour and mutual recognition.|$|E

50|$|However, it is {{not known}} what the load {{distribution}} was in the holds, or even in the cabin, since no loading plan was made. The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> determined <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the forward hold was full of baggage. Equally, the airplane’s dry operating index, that is to say its empty center of gravity, <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> identified. On the documents from Lebanon, two different indices had been used. It was not therefore possible to reconstitute the airplane’s center of gravity as it was on 25 December.|$|R
5000|$|After the merger, General Director of BMW Franz Josef Popp asked Design Director Max Friz {{to assess}} the Helios motorcycle. Upon {{completing}} his assessment, Friz suggested to Popp <b>that</b> the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done with the Helios would be to dump it in the nearest lake. More specifically, Friz condemned the Douglas-style transverse-crankshaft layout, which heavily restricted the cooling of the rear cylinder.|$|R

Meanwhile the Irishman continued to refresh himself with the bread and cheese.|$|E

[...] Miss Staveley might be as ill-natured as she pleased, on the way home. It didn't matter what she said. The Eunice of {{yesterday}} might have been mortified and offended. The Eunice of to-day was indifferent to the sharpest <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> said to her.|$|E
6000|$|Larry, whose duty {{it was to}} cut firewood, remarked, as he {{administered}} {{his first}} powerful blow to a dead tree, that [...] "grub and slumber at night was the chief joys o' life, and the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> compared to 'em was, slumber and grub in the mornin'!"

6000|$|... "Your {{reasoning}} {{powers are}} admirable," [...] {{he said when}} he recovered his gravity, [...] "and you have completely convinced me. An hour ago if it had been suggested to me that I should open that cellar I should have viewed the proposal with horror; now {{it seems to me that}} it is the very best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done for all parties, including the wine itself." ...|$|R

I think that he got out of it very well for such a stupid man." ...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not answer}} for a few moments, and then she said: [...] "I suppose you must {{consider}} me a very deceptive sort of person, but you should remember that these things were not done for my own good, and, as far as I can see, {{they were the only}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done.

60|$|For {{a moment}} or two there was a silence that was {{expressive}} of dismay, as they realized that in the haste and confusion they had saved only the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> replaced. The result of this might prove disastrous, for giant-powder and detonators are comparatively dear in that country, and in any case are not obtainable in the bush. To hire labor was in the meanwhile out of the question, and the progress two men could make cutting through hard rock with only the pick and drill was, as they were quite aware, likely to be remarkably small. Saunders made a little dejected gesture.|$|E
60|$|Sophy {{knew her}} father too well, and {{had too much}} reticence to say any more. He was {{certainly}} meditating deeply, and reading too, indeed he would almost have appeared to have a fit of the study, but for little Maurice, a tyrannical little gentleman, who domineered over the entire household, {{and would have been}} grievously spoilt, if his mother had not taken all the crossing the stout little will upon herself. He had a gallant pair of legs, and the disposition of a young Centaur, he seemed to divide the world into <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> ridden on, and that could not; and when he bounced at the study door, with 'Papa! gee! gee!' and lifted up his round, rosy face, and despotic blue eyes, Mr. Kendal's foot was at his service, and the study was brown no longer.|$|E

5000|$|Sharp {{was born}} in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 1988. Following {{concerns}} about his lack of language development - he only used one or two words occasionally and exhibited some unusual behaviours and was constantly upset - {{he was diagnosed with}} autism at the age of three.

It's the phase that our civilization has contributed to the {{physiognomy}} of scandal, just as the exile of the defaulter is the phase we have contributed to the physiognomy of crime.

6000|$|This is {{the more}} effeminate type of the two; but both are weak and unbalanced. And it is only these two types, the sentimental {{humanitarian}} and the sentimental brutalitarian, whom one hears in the modern babel. Yet you very rarely meet either {{of them in a}} train. You never meet anyone else in a controversy. The man you meet in a train is like this man that I met: he is emotionally decent, only he is intellectually doubtful. So far from luxuriating in the loathsome <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> [...] "done" [...] to criminals, he feels bitterly how much better it would be if nothing need be done. But something must be done. [...] "I s'pose we 'ave to do it." [...] In short, he is simply a sane man, and of a sane man there is only one safe definition. He is a man who can have tragedy in his heart and comedy in his head.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pennel, to be sure, had silks and satins, and flowered India chintz, {{and even}} a Cashmere shawl, the fruits of some of her husband's earlier voyages, which were, however, {{carefully}} stowed away for occasions so high and mighty, that they seldom saw the light. Not to wear best things every day was a maxim of New England thrift as little disputed as any verse of the catechism; and so Mrs. Pennel found the stuff gown of her own dyeing and spinning so respectable for most purposes, that it figured even in the meeting-house itself, except on the very finest of Sundays, when heaven and earth seemed alike propitious. A person can well afford to wear homespun stuff to meeting, who is buoyed up by a secret consciousness of an abundance of fine <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> worn, if one were so disposed, and everybody respected Mrs. Pennel's homespun the more, because they thought {{of the things she}} didn't wear.|$|E
60|$|I am supposing now {{the plague}} to be begun, as I have said, {{and that the}} magistrates began to take the {{condition}} of the people into their serious consideration. What they did as to the regulation of the inhabitants and of infected families, I shall speak to by itself; but as to the affair of health, it is proper to mention it here that, having seen the foolish humour of the people in running after quacks and mountebanks, wizards and fortune-tellers, which they did as above, even to madness, the Lord Mayor, a very sober and religious gentleman, appointed physicians and surgeons for relief of the poor--I mean the diseased poor and in particular ordered the College of Physicians to publish directions for cheap remedies for the poor, in all the circumstances of the distemper. This, indeed, {{was one of the most}} charitable and judicious <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done at that time, for this drove the people from haunting the doors of every disperser of bills, and from taking down blindly and without consideration poison for physic and death instead of life.|$|E

60|$|The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> devised after {{consultation}} {{between the}} two consuls, the French envoy, and the English captain, was that an audience should be demanded of the Dey, and Estelle's letter presented the next morning.

60|$|Presently his African servant {{approached}} him, and at {{once their}} thoughts changed to a larger toleration. Caswall looked indeed a savage--but a cultured savage. In him were traces of the softening civilisation of ages--of some of the higher instincts and education of man, no matter how rudimentary these might be. But the face of Oolanga, as his master called him, was unreformed, unsoftened savage, and inherent in it were all the hideous possibilities of a lost, devil-ridden child of the forest and the swamp--the lowest of all created <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> regarded as in some form ostensibly human. Lady Arabella and Oolanga arrived almost simultaneously, and Adam was surprised to notice what effect their appearance had on each other. The woman seemed as if she would not--could not--condescend to exhibit any concern or interest in such a creature. On the other hand, the negro's bearing was such as in itself to justify her pride. He treated her not merely as a slave treats his master, but as a worshipper would treat a deity. He knelt before her with his hands out- stretched and his forehead in the dust. So long as she remained he did not move; {{it was only when}} she went over to Caswall that he relaxed his attitude of devotion and stood by respectfully.|$|E
60|$|The {{same thing}} applied to her {{physical}} personality. Contours, coloring, features, were <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> defined and appraised; {{but there was}} besides, in Evelyn's case, an aura that only now and then could dimly be perceived by senses attuned to it. It enveloped her in a mystic light. Again he remembered how he had sought her with crude longing and cold appreciation. He had failed to comprehend her; the one creditable thing he had done was the renouncing of his claim. Then the half-formed idea grew plainer that she would understand and sympathize with {{what he was doing}} now. It was to keep faith with those who trusted him that he meant stubbornly to prosecute his search and, if the present journey failed, to come back again. That Evelyn would ever hear of his undertaking, appeared most improbable; but this did not matter. He knew now that it was the remembrance of her that had largely animated him to make the venture; and to go on {{in the face of all}} opposing difficulties was something he could do in her honor. Then by degrees his eyes grew heavy, and when he sank down in his wet blankets sleep came to him. Perhaps he had been fanciful--he was undoubtedly overstrung--but, through such dreams as he indulged in, passing glimpses of strange and splendid visions that transfigure the toil and clamor of a material world are now and then granted to wayfaring men.|$|E
6000|$|I find it {{a little}} {{difficult}} to disentangle the causes that have restricted the flow of these inventions. It has happened, I remark, to others {{as well as to}} myself, and in spite of the kindliest encouragement to continue from editors and readers. There was a time when life bubbled with short stories; they were always coming to the surface of my mind, and it is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production. It is rather, I think, a diversion of attention to more sustained and more exacting forms. It was my friend Mr. C.L. Hind who set that spring going. He urged me to write short stories for the Pall Mall Budget, and persuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that I could do what he desired. There existed at the time only the little sketch, [...] "The Jilting of Jane," [...] included in this volume--at least, that is the only tolerable fragment of fiction I find surviving from my pre-Lewis-Hind period. But I set myself, so encouraged, to the experiment of inventing moving and interesting <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> given vividly in the little space of eight or ten such pages as this, and for a time I found it a very entertaining pursuit indeed. Mr. Hind's indicating finger had shown me an amusing possibility of the mind. I found that, taking almost anything as a starting-point and letting my thoughts play about it, there would presently come out of the darkness, in a manner quite inexplicable, some absurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial nucleus. Little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out of nothingness, incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares; violent conflicts would break out amidst the flower-beds of suburban gardens; I would discover I was peering into remote and mysterious worlds ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity.|$|E
