5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> a rope, that they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the rope.|$|E

25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> and off.|$|E
25|$|Wing warping {{consists}} of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control. The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899, {{came up with the}} idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the wings. Later on, the young French engineer Robert Esnault-Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was Henry Farman, a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.|$|E

500|$|The executioner, William Calcraft, was {{the most}} famous of the 19th century, but was {{reportedly}} nervous of executing Fenians, because of threats he had received.

500|$|Many Bolliger & Mabillard {{coasters}} feature {{an element}} {{known as a}} [...] "pre-drop", a short drop after {{the top of the}} lift hill and {{before the start of the}} first drop, designed to reduce stress on the lift chain. The flat section between the pre-drop and the first drop serves as a shelf to support the weight of the train, reducing related stresses on the chain. On most coasters without a pre-drop, the weight of the train tends <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the lift chain as it begins its descent because the latter half of the train is still being lifted by the chain. Pre-drops have not been used on the company's Dive or Flying coasters, or on hyper coasters built after 1999. OzIris at Parc Astérix was the first B inverted roller coaster that does not feature a pre-drop. Ever since no coaster built by B has featured a pre-drop because the chain accelerates on newer coasters of B after the train passes the crest to acquire the same speed as the train when it is being taken over by gravity.|$|E
500|$|After the Netherlands' exit at Euro 2000, Overmars {{was asked}} whether he would stay at Arsenal. He replied: [...] "I really don't {{want to talk about}} it at the moment but you never know. There are some {{meetings}} with the club going on, we will talk over the next week." [...] Lazio and Barcelona were reportedly interested in signing Overmars; the latter club hastened their efforts once Joan Gaspart was elected as president. Overmars was [...] "flattered" [...] by Barcelona's interest and said moving to such a club would [...] "excite any player". Gaspart travelled to London to open negotiations with Arsenal and eventually reached an agreement to sign Overmars and his teammate Emmanuel Petit for a combined fee of around £32million in July 2000. Overmars cost £25million, making him the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The announcement of his transfer was unconventional; he publicised it on his personal website before informing the media. His site garnered 250,000 hits in one day, highlighting the internet's [...] "potential for exponential growth" [...] in regards to football. Overmars was delighted with the move, saying, [...] "I can't wait <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the famous shirt and play my first game." ...|$|E

Wilmore had previously guest starred in the series as Mr. Brown, the diversity instructor who gives a presentation to the office in the first season episode [...] "Diversity Day". The episode was originally {{going to be about}} [...] "weight loss" [...] and be one of the very first episodes of the second season aired. However, after [...] "The Dundies" [...] and [...] "The Fire", series creator and developer Greg Daniels decided to hold the episode off and combine it with elements of [...] "The Client". When [...] "Performance Review" [...] was being formulated, Wilmore had [...] "four different ideas that were scrunched together to make an episode". One of the ideas was on a card that said [...] "Thursday Friday". After inquiring about the meaning, Wilmore loved the idea and noted that it [...] "would be great" [...] in the episode and a [...] "real funny thing <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> Dwight". Originally, the episode contained a subplot wherein Pam attempts to get a new chair approved by Michael. The scenes, in fact, were shot, but were never aired.|$|E
500|$|In July 1937, Omaha {{was serving}} as {{flagship}} of the Special Service Squadron {{when she was}} relieved by the year old gunboat [...] On 19 July, Omaha became grounded on a reef at Castle Island, Bahamas, near [...] During the investigation it was stated that, [...] "she quickly and evenly decelerated as the bottom engaged the smooth reef." [...] The grounding had occurred during high tide, which made dislodging the cruiser more difficult. After removing {{as much as possible}} in an attempt to lighten the ship the salvagers employed tugs <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> Omaha while destroyers circled around them to create waves. After ten days of attempts, on 29 July, Omaha was finally floated free. She got underway the following day for the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, where she underwent repairs. A general court martial, held on 11 October 1937, found that Captain Howard B. Mecleary, Omahas commanding officer {{at the time of the}} grounding, was guilty of negligence [...] "resulting in the stranding of the vessel", he was sentenced to the loss of 25 numbers on the captain’s list. On 14 February 1938, Omaha got underway after having the damage to her hull repaired, with Captain Wallace L. Lind, as her new commanding officer. She conducted sea trials while en route to Guantánamo.|$|E
500|$|However, Mido re-joined Tottenham on 29 August on a {{permanent}} deal for a fee of €6.75million. After returning to Tottenham he commented on the team's official website that he [...] "always knew in his heart he would be coming back" [...] and that he [...] "couldn't wait <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> a Tottenham shirt, play at the Lane and score some more goals". However, soon after this, Mido was accused of being [...] "irresponsible and disrespectful" [...] by his manager Martin Jol, following comments Mido had made about former Tottenham player Sol Campbell. After failing to score in his first five appearances as {{a permanent}} Tottenham player, he finally found the net against rivals West Ham with a match-winning volley on 19 October 2006, and followed that with two goals against League Two side Milton Keynes Dons in the League Cup. He {{had to contend with}} being fourth in line for one of the two striking spots, but insisted that this was a sign of the club's strength, and something he was fully aware of before rejoining the club. However, he was linked with a move to Manchester City. Mido scored what looked to be his final goal for Tottenham on 31 January 2007 against Arsenal, but his potential move to Manchester City fell through half an hour before the close of the transfer window. He eventually admitted he made a mistake by joining Tottenham {{on a permanent}} deal. He ended the 2006–07 season with 23 appearances and 5 goals.|$|E

500|$|Although Calcraft's {{career as}} a hangman spanned 45years, {{he appears to have}} been [...] "particularly incompetent", {{frequently}} having to [...] "rush below the scaffold <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> his victim's legs to hasten death". Those being hanged had their arms pinioned to their sides with leather straps before being walked to the gallows, where they were placed on a trapdoor and their heads and faces covered with a white cap, or hood. The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor– and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment– and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner's face. After the noose had been secured around each victim's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance, the trapdoor was released. The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred, before being lowered to the ground. Calcraft employed the short-drop method of execution, in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around [...] or so. [...] That was often insufficient to break the prisoner's neck, and therefore death was not always instantaneous, typically occurring slowly by strangulation. Historians Anthony Stokes and Theodore Dalrymple have suggested that Calcraft's [...] "controversial" [...] use of the short-drop allowed him a couple of minutes to entertain the large crowds of 30,000 plus that sometimes attended his public executions. [...] "Renowned for his poor taste", he would sometimes swing from his victim's legs or climb onto their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks. In one of the first executions Calcraft carried out at the new Reading Gaol his victim, Thomas Jennings, took more than three minutes to die.|$|E

2500|$|An {{equilibrium}} tidal bulge {{does not}} really exist on Earth because the continents do not allow this mathematical solution to take place. Oceanic tides actually rotate around the ocean basins as vast gyres around several amphidromic points where no tide exists.

The [...] "bulges" [...] that actually do exist for the Moon <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> (and which pull on the Moon) are the net result of integrating the actual undulations over all the world's oceans.
