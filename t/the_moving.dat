50|$|The {{viscosity}} of gases is {{the result}} in the transfer of each molecule of gas as they pass each other from layer to layer. As gases tend to pass one another, the velocity, {{in the form of}} momentum, of <b>the</b> faster <b>moving</b> molecule speeds up <b>the</b> slower <b>moving</b> molecule. As <b>the</b> slower <b>moving</b> molecule passes <b>the</b> faster <b>moving</b> molecule, <b>the</b> momentum of <b>the</b> slower <b>moving</b> particle slows down <b>the</b> faster <b>moving</b> particle. <b>The</b> molecules continue to enact until frictional drag causes both molecules to equalize their velocities.|$|R

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 21, 1911. The film was originally set to be released under the title The Patriot Maid of '76. The reason for the title change {{was due to the}} release by the Rex Motion Picture Company's A Heroine of '76 on February 16, 1911. Though the film bears similarity in title and character, the plots were entirely different. Rex's film was also the first release by the new company. For the release of this patriotic film, Thanhouser made additional efforts for promoting the film in trade publications. A film still was used as the cover illustration on the February 11, 1911 issue of <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Picture News and a full-page still would be included in the <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Picture Worlds February 11 issue.|$|E

5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> {{parts of the}} engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> parts.|$|E
