30|$|The {{discomfort}} {{felt in the}} premolars and canines {{were recorded}} in this study. This {{was an attempt to}} better standardize the sample. Primarily, because the brackets used for both teeth were identical. Secondly, because the type of tooth appears to influence on the threshold of pain, since the biggest complaints have been previously reported during incisor debonding [12]. This may be explained because the tactile sensory thresholds of normal people were about 1  g in the anterior portion of the dental arch and gradually increased toward the posterior segments of the arch, ranging from 5 to 10  gm [30]. Conversely, patient’s gender appear to have little influence on the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> [10]; thus, we decided not to distinguish the groups by gender.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, contradictions {{related to}} {{medicine}} use abound {{in a social}} {{environment in which the}} pursuit of health has become a cultural project. In a marketplace where over half a million health products are available, choices at once seem to foster agency and encourage dependency on medical fixes. The aggressive marketing of medicines as indispensable commodities co-exits with rising concerns among the lay population about what is safe in the short- and long-term. In this paper we broadly consider medication-related practice in the United States as it is affected by social, cultural, and political-economic factors. We direct attention to changes in medicine use related to product proliferation, lowered <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> the economics <b>of</b> health care, and a revival of the self-help ethic. We also consider {{the manner in which the}} demand for and use of medications reflect deeply embedded cultural ideals and emergent perceptions of need.

40|$|Objective: Even though {{pressure}} on feet is generally unavoidable and undue {{pressure on}} some regions {{have been widely}} accepted as the major source <b>of</b> foot <b>discomfort,</b> pain and problems, there is little understanding of related human perceptions. The {{purpose of this study}} is two-folded: (1) to evaluate the reliability of a developed indentation apparatus for measuring pressure <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and pain; (2) to determine the pressure sensitivity map on foot. Method: The pressure discomfort threshold (PDT) and pressure pain <b>threshold</b> (PPT) <b>of</b> 13 representative test locations distributed on the right feet of 20 healthy subjects (10 males and 10 females) were measured twice through a developed indentation apparatus. Results: Measurement reliability tests (intra-class correlation, ICC) on both PDT and PPT demonstrate that the participants are not only capable of judging the pain threshold, but also reliably differentiate discomfort from pain. PDT is highly correlated to PPT and PDT accounts for slightly less than half of the PPT. Pressure sensitivity of the foot varies across the test locations of the foot and a typical sensitivity pattern has been found: except for the medial plantar arch and foot center, which have less contact with the ground and bears less load, all tested locations on the foot sole have higher PDT and PPT than those on the foot dorsum. Conclusions: The developed indentation apparatus can be used for measuring pressure thresholds with reasonable levels of reliability. The pressure sensitivity map on foot and quantitative data of PDT, PPT can help footwear designers distinguish sensitive foot locations under pressure and then design tissue-compliant footwear products for improved footwear comfort...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Functional {{abdominal}} pain syndrome (FAPS) has chronic unexplained {{abdominal pain}} and {{is similar to}} the psychiatric diagnosis of somatoform pain disorder. A patient with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) also has chronic unexplained abdominal pain, and rectal hypersensitivity is observed in a majority of the patients. However, no reports have evaluated the visceral sensory function of FAPS precisely. We aimed to test the hypothesis that FAPS would show altered visceral sensation compared to healthy controls or IBS. The present study determined the rectal perceptual <b>threshold,</b> intensity <b>of</b> sensation using visual analogue scale (VAS), and rectal compliance in response to rectal balloon distention by a barostat in FAPS, IBS, and healthy controls. Methods First, the ramp distention of 40 ml/min was induced and the <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> pain, and maximum tolerance (mmHg) were measured. Next, three phasic distentions (60 -sec duration separated by 30 -sec intervals) of 10, 15 and 20 mmHg were randomly loaded. The subjects were asked to mark the VAS in reference to subjective intensity of sensation immediately after each distention. A pressure-volume relationship was determined by plotting corresponding pressures and volumes during ramp distention, and the compliance was calculated over the linear part of the curve by calculating from the slope of the curve using simple regression. Results Rectal thresholds were significantly reduced in IBS but not in FAPS. The VAS ratings of intensity induced by phasic distention (around the <b>discomfort</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> the controls) were increased in IBS but significantly decreased in FAPS. Rectal compliance was reduced in IBS but not in FAPS. Conclusion An inconsistency of visceral sensitivity between lower and higher pressure distention might be a key feature for understanding the pathogenesis of FAPS. </p...|$|R

The use of peripherally restricted and more selective H 1 R antagonists may further improve treatment possibilities. We examined {{the use of}} fexofenadine and ebastine to reverse post-stress visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats. Methods: The visceromotor response to colonic distension was assessed in adult maternally separated and nonhandled rats pre- and 24 hours post water avoidance. Subsequently rats were treated with vehicle alone or different dosages of fexofenadine (1. 8 and 18 mg/kg) or ebastine (0. 1 and 1. 0 mg/kg) and re-evaluated. Colonic tissue was collected to assess relative RMCP- 2 and occludin expression levels by Western blot and histamine- 1 receptor by RT-qPCR. b-hexosaminidase release by RBL- 2 H 3 cells was used to establish possible mast cell stabilizing properties of the antagonists. Key results:Water avoidance only induced enhanced response to distension in maternally separated rats. This response was reversed by 1. 8 and 18 mg/kg fexofenadine. Reversal was also obtained by 1. 0 but not 0. 1 mg/kg ebastine. RMCP- 2 expression levels were comparable in these two ebastine treatment groups but occludin was significantly higher in 1. 0 mg/ kg treated rats.

In a balanced order, participants walked at 35 % VO 2 max for 45 minutes (WALK) (29. 0 ± 1. 9 °C, 29. 8 ± 3. 6 % RH, no wind) in one test {{and in a}} separate test ran at 70 % VO 2 max for 45 minutes (RUN) (26. 2 ± 2. 1 °C, 31. 1 ± 7. 0 % RH, no wind). During both tests, participants wore a loose fitting 100 % polyester long sleeve top and trouser ensemble with a low resistance to heat and vapour transfer (total thermal resistance of 0. 154 m 2 ∙K∙W- 1 and total water vapour resistance of 35. 9 m 2 ∙Pa∙W- 1). wlocal, change from baseline in GSC (ΔGSC) and local thermal comfort were recorded every 5 minutes. The results suggest that both wlocal and ΔGSC are strong predictors of thermal comfort during the WALK when sweat production is low and thermal discomfort minimal (r 2 > 0. 78 and r 2 > 0. 71, respectively). Interestingly, during the RUN wlocal plateaued at ~ 0. 6 - 0. 8 due to the high sweat production, whilst ΔGSC gradually increased throughout the experiment. ΔGSC had a similar relationship with thermal comfort to wlocal during the RUN (r 2 > 0. 95 and r 2 > 0. 94, respectively). Despite the strength of these relationships, the ability of wlocal to predict local thermal comfort accurately dramatically reduces in the exponential part of the curve. In a situation of uncompensated heat stress such as high metabolic rate in hot climate, where sweat production is high, ΔGSC shows {{to be a better}} predictor of local thermal comfort than wlocal. The wlocal data shows regional differences in the threshold which triggers local discomfort during the WALK than RUN; lower values are found for upper arms (0. 22 ± 0. 03 and 0. 28 ± 0. 22) and upper legs (0. 22 ± 0. 11 and 0. 22 ± 0. 10), higher values for upper back (0. 30 ± 0. 12 and 0. 36 ± 0. 10) and chest (0. 27 ± 0. 10 and 0. 39 ± 0. 32), respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Repeated {{exposure}} to stress leads to mast cell degranulation, microscopic inflammation, and subsequent visceral hypersensitivity in animal models. To what extent this pathophysiological pathway {{has a role}} in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been properly investigated. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the relationship between visceral hypersensitivity, microscopic inflammation, and the stress response in IBS. METHODS: Microscopic inflammation of the colonic mucosa was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 66 IBS patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HV). Rectal sensitivity was assessed by a barostat study using an intermittent pressure-controlled distension protocol. Salivary cortisol to a psychological stress was measured to assess the stress response. RESULTS: Compared with HV, mast cells, T cells, and macrophages were decreased in IBS patients. Similarly, lambda-free light chain (FLC) -positive mast cells were decreased but not immunoglobulin E (IgE) - and IgG-positive mast cells. There were no differences between hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS patients.

Methods Ten IBS patients and 12 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent a barostat study to assess rectal sensitivity using an intermittent pressure-controlled distension protocol before and after sigmoid stimulation. Repetitive sigmoid stimulation is a validated method to increase visceral perception in IBS patients, consisting of a 10 -min period of 30 s stimuli (60 mmHg), separated by 30 s of rest (5 mmHg). The effect of placebo and Delta(9) -THC (5 and 10 mg in healthy volunteers and 10 mg in IBS patients) on rectal sensitivity was evaluated on respectively three and two separate days in a double blind, randomized, crossover fashion. Key Results All participants (HV and IBS) reported central side effects during the highest dose of Delta(9) -THC, most frequently increased awareness of the surrounding, light-headedness and sleepiness, whereas no side effects where reported during placebo. Although blood pressure was not affected, heart rate increased in both HV and IBS, but was most pronounced in IBS patients.

40|$|Some people {{experience}} visual discomfort when watching stereoscopic content, which {{to a large}} extent can be predicted by their binocular visual status. Earlier research has proven that the binocular status can be assessed by the difference in reading speed between 2 -D and 3 -D. In this paper, we further substantiate the evidence for a tool to screen people on their susceptibility to such visual complaints based on this reading speed difference. In an experiment participants were asked to (1) perform the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT) at three disparities (- 1. 5 °, 0 ° and 1. 5 °) preceded and followed by fusion measurements and self-reports, and (2) scale the screen disparity of stimuli to a <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>discomfort.</b> Participants were categorized based on the WRRT-ratio, being the ratio of the number of words read at 0 ° disparity over the number of words read at - 1. 5 ° disparity. Our results showed that only participants with a high WRRT-ratio revealed a tendency in changed fusion range indicating visual fatigue. They also reported significantly more visual discomfort in stereoscopic conditions and had lower thresholds in screen disparity for visual discomfort than participants with a normal WRRT-ratio. Hence, the WRRT-ratio has potential as a visual screening tool in 3 -D consumer applications to warn viewers that are susceptible to visual discomfort when watching stereoscopic conten...|$|R
40|$|Investigating on society-related {{heat wave}} hazards {{is a global}} issue {{concerning}} the people health. In the last two decades, Europe experienced several severe heat wave episodes with catastrophic effects in term of human mortality (2003, 2010 and 2015). Recent climate investigations confirm that this threat will represent a key issue for the resiliency of urban communities in next decades. Several important mitigation actions (Heat-Health Action Plans) against heat hazards have been already implemented in some WHO (World Health Organization) European region member states to encourage preparedness and response to extreme heat events. Nowadays, social media (SM) offer new opportunities to indirectly measure the impact of heat waves on society. Using the crowdsensing concept, a micro-blogging platform like Twitter {{may be used as}} a distributed network of mobile sensors that react to external events by exchanging messages (tweets). This work presents a preliminary analysis of tweets related to heat waves that occurred in Italy in summer 2015. Using TwitterVigilance dashboard, developed by the University of Florence, a sample of tweets related to heat conditions was retrieved, stored and analyzed for main features. Significant associations between the daily increase in tweets and extreme temperatures were presented. The daily volume of Twitter users and messages revealed to be a valuable indicator of heat wave impact at the local level, in urban areas.

40|$|This article {{argues for}} {{conducting}} emancipatory narrative {{research with the}} explicit intent of transforming participants’ lives by opening up new subjective possibilities. Drawing from Megan Boler’s pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and Gubrium and Holstein’s active interviewing, a narrative research method called an inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is proposed. An inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> emphasizes the proactive and transformative potential of research projects for both researcher and participant. The aim of an inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is to identify and promote a beneficial shift from dualistic, categorical, and entrenched subjective positionality to a more ambiguous engagement with social reality. The argument is considered in light of preliminary empirical findings from a narrative pilot study of masculine heterosexual subjectivity in graduate education, conducted {{in the fall of}} 2003. Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, the general features of an inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> within an emancipatory narrative study are presented...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: A gold {{standard}} or validated tool for monitoring the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> during continuous palliative sedation (CPS) is lacking. Therefore, {{little is known}} about the course <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in sedated patients, the efficacy of CPS, and the determinants <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> during CPS. OBJECTIVES: To identify the course <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in patients receiving CPS. METHODS: A prospective observational multicenter study in nine hospices and palliative care units was performed. The <b>Discomfort</b> Scale-Dementia <b>of</b> Alzheimer Type (DS-DAT) was independently assessed for monitoring <b>of</b> patient <b>discomfort</b> during CPS. The DS-DAT scores range from 0 (no observed discomfort) to a maximum of 27 (high level <b>of</b> observed <b>discomfort).</b> Using a mixed model, the mean group score <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> between four predefined time frames of CPS was compared, correcting for confounding patient characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were sedated, and the DS-DAT was completed in 106 patients at least once. The median duration of the sedation in these 106 patients was 25. 5 hours (range 2 - 161). The mean score of the DS-DAT in the phase before sedation was 12. 16 (95 % CI 9. 83 - 14. 50) and decreased significantly to 8. 06 (95 % CI 5. 53 - 10. 58) in the titration phase of sedation. The mean score of the DS-DAT in the final phase of sedation was 7. 42 (95 % CI 4. 90 - 9. 94). CONCLUSION: This study shows that CPS is associated with a decrease in the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> within an acceptable time frame, although in some sedated patients higher levels <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in the last hours of life occurred. Although the DS-DAT seems to be of value for monitoring the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> during CPS, the results of this study should be interpreted within the constraints of the limitations, and further research on the psychometric properties of this tool is needed before the DS-DAT can be used in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Road {{geometry}} and traffic conditions influence strongly drivers behaviour. The authors propose {{a model for}} the evaluation of driver’s level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> LD locally induced by different road environments and traffic flow conditions. The main theoretical hypothesis behind the model is that a significant indicator of the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is computed as proportional to the difference between driver’s desired speed Sd and the operating speed So imposed by local traffic density. To evaluate the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> for an homogeneous road segment, the variation of road characteristics and traffic conditions in terms of flow and composition must be taken into account. Moreover driver’s desired speed depends on the individual reason of the travel. Therefore, considering a traffic condition, the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> at a specific road location will assume different value for each flow typology. The greater the difference between driver’s desired speed and flow speed, the higher the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Twenty-five Italian rural two way-two lane road segments have been analysed. Field surveys were needed for data collection. The discrepancies between drivers expectations and operating conditions have been analysed. These data have been correlated with road dependent collisions of each road segment. This paper shows the results and points out the validity and applicability of the model to actual case studies for the evaluation of the expected accident occurrence {{as a function of the}} level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> suffered by road users...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} dependence <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> caused by vertical mechanical shocks {{has been investigated}} with 20 seated males exposed to upward and downward shocks at 13 fundamental frequencies (1 – 16  Hz) and 18 magnitudes (± 0. 12 to ± 8. 3  ms − 2). The rate <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> with increasing shock magnitude depended on the fundamental frequency of the shocks, so the {{frequency dependence}} of equivalent comfort contours (for both vertical acceleration and vertical force measured at the seat) varied with shock magnitude. The rate <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> was similar for acceleration and force, upward and downward shocks, and lower and higher magnitude shocks. The frequency dependence <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> from shocks {{differs from that of}} sinusoidal vibrations having the same fundamental frequencies. This arises in part from the frequency content of the shock. Frequency weighting W b in BS 6841 : 1987 and ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 provided reasonable estimates <b>of</b> the <b>discomfort</b> caused by the shocks investigated in this study. Practitioner Summary: No single frequency weighting can accurately predict the discomfort caused by mechanical shocks over wide ranges of shock magnitude, but vibration dose values with frequency weighting W b provide reasonable estimates <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> caused by shocks similar to those investigated in this study with peak accelerations well below 1  g. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} assesses whether intense {{visual stimulation}} {{can act as}} a stressor to migraine sufferers between attacks, and whether subjective and psychophysiological reactions to these stimuli can clarify how migraine attacks may be triggered. The first study assessed <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> light-induced <b>discomfort</b> and pain in migraine sufferers and non-migrainous controls during a non-headache period. Two instruction sets were compared to assess whether information presented to participants would affect thresholds. The results showed that migraineurs had significantly lower thresholds for light-induced pain. However, this effect was most apparent in those who had heard the negatively biased instructions reinforcing the need to control contextual factors when assessing subjective phenomena such as visual discomfort. The second study assessed subjective and psychophysiological responses of female migraine sufferers and female controls during exposure to visual stimuli incorporating spatial and temporal characteristics that {{are most likely to be}} bothersome to migraineurs. Two control stimuli were included to assess responses during similar, but theoretically less aversive conditions. Migraine sufferers had higher heart rate and more frequent electrodermal responses than controls at all points of the study, including baseline and recovery. However, while migraineurs reported higher anxiety during the intense conditions, and reported more visual and somatic complaints than controls during various viewing conditions, they did not show heart rate, heart rate variability or electrodermal changes that would suggest clear changes in autonomic function in response to aversive visual stimulation. The third study assessed ambulatory electrocardiograms to investigate whether autonomic changes would be evident in the period leading up to, during or following a migraine. Three individuals were assessed on a day when they experienced a naturally occurring headache, and on a day when they were not. No obvious pattern of autonomic change was detected before or after headache, although there was some evidence that a pattern of increased heart rate and decreased vagal tone may accompany headache. In summary, the results confirm that migraine sufferers are more sensitive to intense visual stimulation than controls, but do not support the contention that exposure results in widespread autonomic changes. Since interictal visual discomfort is a common in migraine, further research is needed to clarify how it can be incorporated into models of migraine pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} {{assumed that the}} same frequency weightings, derived from studies <b>of</b> vibration <b>discomfort,</b> {{can be used to}} evaluate the severity of vibration at all vibration magnitudes from the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> vibration perception to the vibration magnitudes associated with risks to health. This experimental study determined equivalent comfort contours for the whole-body vibration of seated subjects over the frequency range 2 – 315 Hz {{in each of the three}} orthogonal axes (fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical). The contours were determined at vibration magnitudes from the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> perception to levels associated with severe discomfort and risks to health. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, thresholds for the perception of vertical vibration were lower than thresholds for fore-and-aft and lateral vibration. At frequencies less than 4 Hz, thresholds for vertical vibration were higher than thresholds for fore-and-aft and lateral vibration. The rate of growth of sensation with increasing vibration magnitude was highly dependent on the frequency and axis of vibration. Consequently, the shapes of the equivalent comfort contours depended on vibration magnitude. At medium and high vibration magnitudes, the equivalent comfort contours were reasonably consistent with the frequency weightings for vibration discomfort in current standards (i. e. Wb and Wd). At low vibration magnitudes, the contours indicate that relative to lower frequencies the standards underestimate sensitivity at frequencies greater than about 30 Hz. The results imply that no single linear frequency weighting can provide accurate predictions <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> caused by a wide range of magnitudes of whole-body vibratio...|$|R
30|$|Patients have {{identified}} anxiety, pain, thirst, and sleep disturbance as major sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and stress during their ICU stay [1 – 4]. Our {{results indicate that}} caregiver’s identification <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> at least partly overlaps with patient experience, with caregivers viewing pain and anxiety as the main sources <b>of</b> patient <b>discomfort.</b> Pain is a major source <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> with half <b>of</b> the patients surveyed in previous studies reporting that they experienced pain during their ICU stay [1, 2]. Because pain {{has been linked to}} delirium and PTSD [10, 11], rapid, patient-tailored pain relief is strongly recommended. However, although almost all those responding to our survey routinely evaluated and treated pain, less than half the responding ICUs had a nurse-driven analgesia protocol. This type of protocol was nevertheless considered to be very useful or essential by almost all respondents.|$|R
