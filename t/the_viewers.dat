5|$|In August 1952 the BBC {{transmitter}} at Wenvoe began broadcasting {{allowing the}} Rhondda to receive television pictures {{for the first}} time. This was followed in January 1958 with Commercial Television provided by Television Wales and the West (TWW), giving <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> of the Rhondda a choice of two television channels.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, the match's {{coverage}} by ZDF {{set a record}} for the country's most watched TV broadcast ever, with 32.57million viewers (87.8% of all viewers), beating the Germany–Spain match at the 2010 World Cup. This record was beaten five days later with the final. In contrast, despite a weekly spike in audience, the broadcast by Brazilian Rede Globo saw <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> total fall with each German goal.|$|E
50|$|When {{the monster}} takes away <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> Lee gets {{a camera and}} takes a picture of <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> He then tells <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to give his love to <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> family and gives two random pieces of advice. At {{the very end of}} the program, after the credits, a picture of <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> is shown, {{followed}} by a burp which could possibly indicate that <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> has been eaten.|$|R
50|$|Although the focused (light) ray cones are {{actually}} {{more or less}} parallel to each other, the rays from the aureole effect appear to be radiating from the shadow of <b>the</b> <b>viewer’s</b> head due to perspective effects. <b>The</b> <b>viewer's</b> line of sight is parallel and lies within the cones, so from <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> perspective <b>the</b> rays seem to be radiating from the antisolar point, within <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> shadow.|$|R
50|$|The Tenth Doctor welcomes <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> into <b>the</b> TARDIS. He {{tells them}} {{that he has been}} {{watching}} <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> for some time, as they have been watching him, and that he has been impressed enough to want to take <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to help him on his next adventure. His current companion, Rose, has been dropped off at Wembley in 1979 for an ABBA concert. He then imbues <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> television remote control with the power of his sonic screwdriver, allowing <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> {{to take part in the}} proceedings.|$|R

5|$|The story then shifts back to Patchy, {{who wants}} to replay the episode, but his {{difficulty}} with the TV remote causes him to accidentally destroy the tape. The episode ends with the narrator telling <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> to get lost.|$|E
5|$|After Lisa's {{eviction}} on Day 90, <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> began {{voting for}} who they wanted to win the programme. On Day 93, the final day, Rodrigo {{was the first to}} be evicted with 11.0% of the five-way vote and he was followed by Charlie, who received 13.2% of the five-way vote. It was then announced that David had finished in third place after gaining 19.0% of the three-way vote. Davina McCall then revealed that Sophie had won this series with 74.4% of the final two-way vote, with Siavash finishing in second place.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>viewer</b> forms a {{relationship}} with the characters, both human and animal, in Rosenthal's works. The irony being that at first look the figures seem isolated and lonely but inherently have a depth that draws <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> into <b>the</b> soul. There is a very strong connection that ties <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to <b>the</b> emotional world of Rosenthal's figures as his work often searches for ways to 'touch' <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fernandes {{has little}} {{interest}} in preserving objects for posterity or in meeting <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> expectations. He {{is more concerned with}} an 'ephemeral expressive situation'. The challenge to <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> is to return from Fernandes' work to experience the artistic moment in <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> own life.|$|R
50|$|For example, if <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> {{was placed}} {{very far away}} from a lone subject in an image, <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> will gather more {{information}} about the subjects’ surroundings and bearing, but very little in terms of his emotions. If the setting {{was in the middle of}} flat plain, <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> might perceive a sense of loneliness or that the subject is lost, because <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> himself cannot find any visual cues to orient the location of the subject. If some foreground elements are put in front of <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> partially obscuring <b>the</b> subject, <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> would take <b>the</b> position of an unseen observer. Especially if the artist chooses to hint malicious intent, a member of the audience might feel uncomfortable looking through the eyes of a stalker.|$|R
5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to wear and versatile, her styles are popular with women of all ages, including <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where they were often featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known for color and print and often pay homage to styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Burch named her line of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E
5|$|FSN Pittsburgh was {{the primary}} {{television}} network. Paul Steigerwald, Dan Potash, Rob King, and former Penguins Bob Errey and Jay Caufield were the station's broadcast team. During the semi-final playoff round against the Washington Capitals, game five set a record as the highest watched game on any FSN regional network in history. It was then surpassed by games six and seven; {{the final game of}} the series drew a 24.97average rating—twice <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> than the second most watched show of the evening.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found that most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that day}} in the United States, word of Senna's death reached Talladega, Alabama where NASCAR was running the Winston Select 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. ESPN, which {{televised}} the San Marino Grand Prix for the American audience, had race commentator Bob Jenkins relay word to <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> during the race. During the postrace festivities, race winner Dale Earnhardt (who would meet a similar fate seven years later) dedicated the victory to Senna.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Potty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary {{environment}} (such as keeping {{ground beef}} {{in an old}} boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. Patchy then tells <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> to watch {{the rest of the}} SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for Patchy to get in his office.|$|E
5000|$|A {{narrative}} crime {{script is}} the logical {{sequence of events}} which can be easily interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to make themselves a participant <b>viewer.</b> <b>The</b> narrative crime script helps <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> by filling {{in the details of}} the story.

5|$|The MTV Europe Music Awards were {{established}} in 1994 by MTV Networks Europe to celebrate the most popular music videos in Europe.

Most of the awards are voted for by <b>the</b> <b>viewers.</b> The awards are presented annually and broadcast live on MTV Europe, MTV and most of the international MTV channels as well as online. Winehouse received one award from four nominations.|$|E
5|$|The old Sixth District was {{centered}} in southwestern and south-central Ohio around McEwen's hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself {{running in a}} huge area stretching from Lebanon to Marietta. This new district {{was very difficult to}} campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities where most of <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> couldn't vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The series earned {{relatively}} average {{ratings for}} GSN's standards. Despite The American Bible Challenge debuting to record ratings for GSN, Beat the Chefs maintained {{less than a}} third of <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> that tuned in to its lead-in. The series premiere averaged 521,000 viewers, compared to the 1.73 million viewers who watched The American Bible Challenge. The following week, Beat the Chefs dropped to 357,000 viewers, while its lead-out, a sneak peek of GSN's upcoming revival of Pyramid, earned 443,000 viewers.|$|E

50|$|Including {{peripheral}} vision, {{the visual}} {{field of the}} average person is approximately 170-180 degrees. Console games are usually played on a TV at a large distance from <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> while PC games are usually played on computer monitors close to <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> Therefore, a narrow FOV of around 60 degrees is used for console games as the screen subtends {{a small part of}} <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> visual field, and a larger FOV of 90 to 100 degrees is usually set for PC games as the screen occupies a larger amount of <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> vision.|$|R
5|$|When Press Your Luck {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{were made}} for the third season, with the {{introduction}} of the season long Xindi storyline. This improved the reviews that the series was receiving, and <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> in the 18 to 35 demographics but the overall ratings continued to decrease. UPN cut the 26 episode order for the third season to 24, meaning that if 24 episodes were created for the fourth season as well then they would have the 100 episodes needed for syndication. As well as a move to Friday nights, the fourth season was shortened further to 22 episodes, meaning that at cancellation there were 98 episodes produced in total. At the time of cancellation, Enterprise remained the highest rated drama series on UPN. The series went immediately into broadcast syndication; the arrangements having been made by UPN prior to the cancellation. It is distributed by CBS Television Distribution.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards <b>the</b> <b>viewers.</b> The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} behind the {{paintings}} is to precipitate social change, to promote {{an understanding of}} humanity and to teach tolerance and the self-empowerment of the individual. In Verdadism, {{the intent of the}} artist is to make a personal connection with <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> through <b>the</b> act of involving <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> in an actual experience in the artist's life. <b>The</b> <b>viewer</b> is encouraged to acknowledge the universality of human nature and the artist invites <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to open their mind to the concept that we are all human beings with shared common experiences.|$|R
50|$|Courschene {{is known}} for his {{interactive}} video installations and environments. In his early works such as Family Portrait and Portrait One (1989), <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> interacts with <b>the</b> a human image programmed to engage in a lifelike conversation with <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> His later work Landscape One (1997) surrounds <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> with a 360 degree immersive and interactive video projection of a park.|$|R
