50|$|Most of the Antarctic {{continent}} is permanently {{covered by}} ice and snow; less than 1% {{of the land}} is exposed. There are only two species of flowering plant, Antarctic <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> and Antarctic pearlwort, but a range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and macrofungi.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of species-rich calcareous grassland and rock-face situated on Carboniferous Limestone. Steeper banks and knolls in the grassland have a flora which includes orchids Somerset <b>Hair</b> <b>Grass</b> (Koeleria vallesiana), and Honewort, (Trinia glauca) and the Goldilocks Aster (Galatella linosyris) {{along with several}} species of butterfly and Weevil (Curculionoidea).|$|R
50|$|Koeleria glauca (commonly {{known as}} Blue <b>Hair</b> <b>Grass)</b> is a grass {{species of the}} genus Koeleria. It grows in dunes and other sandy places. It is mainly {{distributed}} in eastern Central Europe, with its western outposts in the coastal dunes of Jutland and inland dunes in the Rhine Valley.|$|R
50|$|The site is coppiced ancient {{woodland}} on boulder clay. It has diverse tree species, including {{wych elm}} and hornbeam, {{resulting in a}} rich ground flora. Dog's mercury is dominant {{over most of the}} woodland floor, with plants such as angelica sylvestris and tufted <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> in wetter areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 110) for its biological values, especially its relatively luxuriant plant communities. The continent’s only two flowering plants, Antarctic <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> and Antarctic pearlwort, are abundant. The soils associated with the grass swards contain a rich invertebrate fauna.|$|R
25|$|Within the {{heathland}} areas, {{the predominant}} community types are Calluna vulgaris (common heather)–Deschampsia flexuosa (wavy <b>hair</b> <b>grass)</b> (H9) and heather–Ulex gallii (western gorse) (H8). Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is also widespread, with some patches of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and less frequently bell heather (Erica cinerea), cross leaved heath (Erica tetralix) and broom (Cytisus scoparius).|$|R
50|$|Like all fescues, {{the leaves}} are narrow and needle like, making it less {{palatable}} to livestock. The swards that it forms are not as tufted as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) or wavy <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa). The tufted nature is what gives the grass its springy characteristic. The leaves are bright green.|$|R

50|$|The {{park was}} part of the grounds of an {{eighteenth-century}} mansion called Warren House. In 1937 it was acquired by Middlesex County Council and Harrow Urban District Council as public open space. It was later owned by the Greater London Council and transferred to the London Borough of Harrow in 1976. The presence of wild service trees and mature hornbeam shows that part of it is ancient woodland. The main plants in grassland areas are common bent and Yorkshire fog, with tufted <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> in damp areas.|$|R
5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset <b>hair</b> <b>grass,</b> wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|R

50|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{designated}} area is dominated by wavy <b>hair</b> <b>grass,</b> marsh foxtail and creeping bent. The improved grassland is dominated by perennial rye grass, creeping bent and Timothy. The northern section is mostly marshy and comprises rush and sedge species. The marshes also support bog pimpernel and ragged robin. The ditches are significant as they are examples of a disappearing habitat. A wide range of wetland plants flourish with a large population of flote grass and several pondweeds. There are rarities including tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa).|$|R
50|$|The {{partially}} ruined church, on {{the edge}} of Weston-super-Mare, sits on a cliff top the southern slope of which and the quarry at its western end form the Uphill Cliff Site of Special Scientific Interest, notable for its species-rich calcareous grassland. It consists of grassland and rock-face situated on Carboniferous Limestone. Steeper banks and knolls in the grassland have a flora which includes orchids, Somerset <b>Hair</b> <b>Grass</b> (Koeleria vallesiana), and Honewort, (Trinia glauca) and the Goldilocks Aster (Galatella linosyris) along with several species of butterfly and Weevil (Curculionoidea).|$|R
5000|$|Agrostis scabra is {{a common}} species of grass known by the common names <b>hair</b> <b>grass,</b> rough bent, rough bent grass, winter bent grass, and ticklegrass. [...] A tumbleweed, [...] It is a bunchgrass native to Asia and much of North America, and widely known {{elsewhere}} as an introduced species. It occurs {{in most of the}} United States except parts of the Southeast and most of Canada except for the farthest northern regions. It can be found in Mexico and California, and across Alaska to far eastern Asia as far south as Korea.|$|R
50|$|The 158 ha {{island has}} been {{designated}} an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA No.115) because of its relatively diverse flora and fauna, which {{is typical of the}} southern Antarctic Peninsula region. The vegetation consists of abundant stands of the continent’s only two flowering plants, Antarctic <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> and Antarctic pearlwort, as well as well-developed communities of mosses and lichen. The rich invertebrate fauna includes the wingless midge Belgica antarctica, for which the island is one of its southernmost sites. There are also colonies of Adélie penguins and Antarctic shags.|$|R
