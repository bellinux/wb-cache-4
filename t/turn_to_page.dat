500|$|The view {{of history}} propounded in this text is very {{strongly}} influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola {{are important to the}} interplay of the [...] "characters." [...] Vico propounded a cyclical {{view of history}}, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history {{is to be found in}} the opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words [...] "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs." [...] ("vicus" [...] is a pun on Vico) and ends [...] "A way a lone a last a loved a long the." [...] In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from [...] "ideal insomnia" [...] and, on completing the book, would <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>page</b> one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.|$|E
6000|$|Whenever {{a person}} informs us who Sir William Wallace was, or who wrote [...] "Hamlet," [...] {{or where the}} Declaration of Independence was fought, it fills us with a {{suspicion}} wellnigh amounting to conviction, that that person would not suspect us of being so empty of knowledge if he wasn't suffering from the same [...] "claim" [...] himself.

60|$|And Turner {{has given}} us the effect magnificently in the Dartmouth of the River Scenery. It is {{frequent}} among the old masters, and constant in Claude; though the latter, from drawing his beams too fine, represents the effect upon the dazzled eye rather than the light which actually exists, and approximates very closely to the ideal which {{we see in the}} sign of the Rising Sun; nay, I am nearly sure that I remember cases in which he {{has given us}} the diverging beam, without any cloud or hill interfering with the orb. It may, perhaps, be somewhat difficult to say how far it is allowable to represent that kind of ray which is seen by the dazzled eye. It is very certain that we never look towards a bright sun without seeing glancing rays issue from it; but it is equally certain that those rays are no more real existences than the red and blue circles which we see after having been so dazzled, and that if we are to represent the rays we ought also to cover our sky with pink and blue circles. I should on the whole consider it utterly false in principle to represent the visionary beam, and that we ought only to show that which has actual existence. Such we find to be the constant practice of Turner. Even where, owing to interposed clouds, he has beams appearing to issue from the orb itself, they are broad bursts of light, not spiky rays; and his more usual practice is to keep all near the sun in one simple blaze of intense light, and from the first clouds to throw beams to the zenith, though he often does not permit any appearance of rays until close to the zenith itself. Open at the 80th page of the Illustrated edition of Rogers's poems. You have there a sky blazing with sunbeams; but they all begin {{a long way from the}} sun, and they are accounted for by a mass of dense clouds surrounding the orb itself. Turn to the 7th page. Behind the old oak, where the sun is supposed to be, you have only a blaze of undistinguished light; but up on the left, over the edge of the cloud, on its dark side, the sunbeam. <b>Turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 192,--blazing rays again, but all beginning where the clouds do, not one can you trace to the sun; and observe how carefully the long shadow on the mountain is accounted for by the dim dark promontory projecting out near the sun. I need not multiply examples; you will find various modifications and uses of these effects throughout his works. But you will not find a single trace of them in the old masters. They give you the rays issuing from behind black clouds, and because they are a coarse and common effect which could not possibly escape their observation, and because they are easily imitated. They give you the spiky shafts issuing from the orb itself, because these are partially symbolical of light, and assist a tardy imagination, as two or three rays scratched round the sun with a pen would, though they would be rays of darkness instead of light.[30] But of the most beautiful phenomenon of all, the appearance of the delicate ray far in the sky, threading its way among the thin, transparent clouds, while all around the sun is unshadowed fire, there is no record nor example whatsoever in their works. It was too delicate and spiritual for them; probably their blunt and feelingless eyes never perceived it in nature, and their untaught imaginations were not likely to originate it in the study.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{difference}} between the Choose Your Own Adventure series and the Time Machine series was that Time Machine books featured only one ending, forcing the reader to try many different choices until they discovered it. Also, the series taught children basic history about many diverse subjects, from dinosaurs to World War II. Only the sixth book in the series, The Rings of Saturn, departed from actual history; it {{is set in the}} future, and features educational content about the solar system. Some books gave the reader their choice from a small list of equipment at the beginning, and this choice would affect events later in the book (e.g. [...] "If you brought the pen knife, <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 52, if not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 45."). Another {{main difference}} between the Time Machine novels and the Choose Your Own Adventure counterparts was hints offered at certain junctures, where the reader was advised to look at hints {{at the back of the}} book. An example was in Mission to World War II about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, where the reader was given the choice of starting the mission in the Jewish ghetto or the Aryan part of Warsaw, in which the hint read [...] "Hitler may have had Jewish family members", suggesting the reader should begin in the Jewish section of the city, but not ordering it, or it was possible for the hint to be missed.|$|E
5000|$|... 1089 {{is widely}} used in magic tricks {{because it can be}} [...] "produced" [...] from any two three-digit numbers. This allows it to be used as the basis for a Magician's Choice. For instance, one {{variation}} of the book test starts by having the spectator choose any two suitable numbers and then apply some basic math to produce a single four-digit number. That number is always 1089. The spectator is then asked to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 108 of a book and read the 9th word, which the magician has memorized. To the audience it looks like the number is random, but through manipulation, the result is always the same. It is this property that led University of Oxford mathematician David Acheson to title his 2010 book '1089 and all that: a journey into mathematics'.|$|E

If English teachers use an appropriate ice-break as a tool for starting a class, it will be a way of making students to put and assume more attention and interest in a relaxed environment class, getting an interactive and dynamic English class. In this way, teachers will avoid students feel weary and end up silent and out from participation. Ice-breaker activities are effective and easy ways to be developed in the classroom. Progress is notable and greater when these techniques are used in the correct way. Teachers must first identify the special student s needs and then choose an appropriate ice-break activity to create a relaxing atmosphere which gives a self confidence in the students...|$|E
