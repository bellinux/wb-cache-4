MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.|$|E

For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what <b>technical</b> <b>adjustments</b> had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E

40|$|This paper broadly {{surveys the}} {{institutional}} framework comprising Swedish environmental protection during the 1970 s. Some preliminary conclusions are drawn concerning how this framework shaped the <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> process {{with respect to}} environmental concerns at the firm level. Based on {{a case study of}} a Swedish industrial firm, the paper highlights how the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) worked in practice and illuminates some critical problems related to the process of adjusting to the legal framework at the firm level. Institutional theory and the work of Nathan Rosenberg on technological development are used in order to study the influence of the legal framework on the efforts of the company to adjust to environmental demands. The paper suggests that the Swedish system of environmental protection – based on the individual testing system in a co-operative framework – might have promoted long-term innovative and effective technical solutions, because it was consent to decentralised experimental activity. However, before firm conclusions can be drawn, comparative studies within the Swedish system and, perhaps most fruitful, between various national systems of environmental protection are needed...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} a price setting monopolistic firm that has to decide on a price adjustment in light of some new information about the uncertain demand for its product. It is assumed that the firm applies the so-called minimax adjustment principle for this purpose. This optimality principle is based on the notion that human decision makers tend to be reluctant to change their behaviour and prefer to take the current price as a benchmark rather than to compute optimal new prices all the time. We show that the current price is maintained as long as it lies in some set that is derived from the firm's degree of uncertainty and its degree of conservatism as regards changing behaviour. Otherwise, the price is adjusted but kept {{as close as possible to}} the current price. Hence, the model provides an explanation for the existence of price rigidities which is not based on any <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> or menu costs but simply on how human decision makers may deal with uncertainty.

The result of our data analysis suggests that the following are among the factors that contribute to faculty adoption of and satisfaction with online course development and delivery: higher number of online courses previously taught, higher rating of the majority of students' technical sophistication, higher quality of education that faculty believe online students receive, and improvement in traditional teaching ability through online teaching.

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) is an auditory prosthesis that can restore hearing in profoundly deaf or severely hearing impaired subjects, based on electrical {{stimulation of the}} auditory nerve {{by means of an}} electrode array implanted in the cochlea. With the advent of successful neonatal screening, an increasing number of infants, between 6 and 12 months of age, are implanted with a CI. Providing a CI at a young age is indeed observed to be crucial, e. g., for the development of speech and language skills. At the same time, such early implantation poses great challenges for the <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the CI processing. Prior to CI switch on, the stimulation levels for each stimulation channel have tobe mapped to the dynamic range of the individual CI recipient, and thisis again crucial for a proper remedial action. The usual mapping procedure (for adult CI recipients), however, relies on behavioral testing and participation of the CI recipient, which is impossible with infants. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the detection of electrically evoked auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in electroencephalography (EEG) measurements holds great promise for the development of an objective CI mapping procedure, which would not require any participation of the CI recipient. The general goal of this project is to develop signal processing algorithms which are crucial for the realization of an efficient and clinically applicable automated objective CI mapping procedure.
