5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{hurricane}} that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006. It developed {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on October21, and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on October23, and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A strong trough turned the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast into an area of strong vertical shear, and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on October24. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of Baja California Sur the low level circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of the}} convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on October25 a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and after briefly <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast it made landfall on northwestern Sinaloa on October26.|$|E

5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by Sovereign and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if {{it was left to}} perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. <b>Turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E

25|$|In 1935, Senator William Borah of Idaho, {{the chief}} Republican {{specialist}} on foreign policy, {{called for a}} Senate investigation of anti-Catholic government policies in Mexico. He came under a barrage of attacks from leading Protestant organizations, including the Federal Council of Churches, the Episcopal Church, {{and the board of}} foreign missions of the Methodist Church. There was no Senate investigation. A call for an investigation signed by 250 members of the House was blocked by Roosevelt. The Knights of Columbus began attacking Roosevelt. The crisis ended with Mexico <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Calles hard line policies, perhaps in response to Daniels' backstage efforts.

Continuing eastward, the route reaches the southernmost point of the reservoir and a junction with CR105 (Divine Corners Road), which connects to Loch Sheldrake.

Crossing the spillway for the reservoir, NY55 runs northeast into a junction with CR105A (Hasbrouck Road). <b>Turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Neversink, the route winds north and soon northeast into the hamlet of Neversink.

25|$|Kebatinan is {{generally}} characterised as mystical, and some varieties {{were concerned with}} spiritual self-control. Although there were many varieties circulating in 1992, kebatinan often implies pantheistic worship because it encourages sacrifices and devotions to local and ancestral spirits. These spirits are believed to inhabit natural objects, human beings, artefacts, and grave sites of important wali (Muslim saints). Illness and other misfortunes are traced to such spirits, and if sacrifices or pilgrimages fail to placate angry deities, {{the advice of a}} dukun or healer is sought. Kebatinan, while it connotes a <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> militant universalism of orthodox Islam, moves toward a more internalised universalism. In this way, kebatinan moves toward eliminating the distinction between the universal and the local, the communal and the individual.|$|E

25|$|Veterans of {{the heavy}} bomber {{campaign}} frequently cite Twelve O'Clock High as the only Hollywood film that accurately captured their combat experiences. Along with the 1948 film Command Decision, it marked a <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> optimistic, morale-boosting style of wartime films and toward a grittier realism that deals more directly with the human costs of war. Both films deal {{with the realities of}} daylight precision bombing without fighter escort, the basic Army Air Forces doctrine at the start of World War II (prior to the arrival of long range Allied fighter aircraft like the P-51 Mustang). As producers, writers Lay and Bartlett re-used major plot elements of Twelve O'Clock High in later films featuring the U.S. Air Force, the 1950s-era Toward the Unknown and the early 1960s Cold War-era A Gathering of Eagles, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} the play {{is very much in}} keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three is something of a sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell, features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness.|$|E
25|$|Olson (among others) {{believes}} that Burnett was placed under conflicting orders: raiders {{were to be}} destroyed (preferably at range to avoid retaliation), but merchantmen and raider supply ships were to be captured to replace Allied freighters sunk in the tonnage war. The suggested method of capture was to quickly manoeuvre in close and deploy a boarding party before the ship could scuttle. Olson thinks that Kormorans actions (<b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast upon seeing an unknown vessel, delays in replying to signals, the distress call transmitted long after Sydney appeared) made Burnett suspicious, {{and he was trying}} to position Sydney so he could identify the merchantman's physical features and to facilitate capture. Following the loss of Sydney, Admiralty instructions on capturing merchant ships changed to only encourage attempts if there was no risk of the ship being a raider or accompanied by a U-boat; no such attempts were made {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{the smaller}} ship {{directly}} in front of him, the French captain spread all sail and threw Minerve forwards, attempting to ram Dido amidships. If the attack had been successful, Dido would likely have been crushed by the weight of the larger frigate, but Towry was able to respond by throwing the wheel hard to port and <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blow. The frigates were so close that Minerves bowsprit became tangled in the rigging of Didos mizenmast. The effect was to throw Dido hard against Minerves starboard bow and lift the smaller ship almost out of the water, her weight suspended from Minerves bowsprit. Covered by cannon fire from the forward 18-pounder long guns and heavy musketry, the French crew attempted to scramble along the bowsprit and onto Didos deck, the boarding action prevented by sailors armed with pikes. The attack was dangerous, wave action causing the suspended Dido to slam repeatedly against the hull of Minerve, and at approximately 9:00 the bowsprit finally snapped under the strain, fatally plunging at least eight French sailors attempting to board Dido into the gap between the ships. It also dislodged Didos mizenmast, which collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Great grey shrikes breed {{during the}} summer, {{typically}} once per year. In exceptionally good conditions, they raise two broods a year, {{and if the}} first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one. Their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter; birds often choose a different mate than the year before. To seek out potential mates, males will venture outside their breeding territories. If a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking, she will visit {{to see whether they}} get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer. The courtship period is generally longer than in the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), usually starting about March and lasting to April/May. At first, the female rebuffs the male, only allowing him to feed her. Males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> female. He also occasionally turns to sit at a right angle to her. Eventually, the female will join in the male's displays, and the songs will become duets. To feed females and to show off their hunting prowess, males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time. When presenting nesting sites, males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail.|$|E
