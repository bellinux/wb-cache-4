2500|$|The {{magnolia}} <b>green</b> <b>jumper</b> {{is small}} for a jumping spider, with adult females measuring 7-8mm and adult males 5-6mm. [...] Most specimens {{appear as a}} pale, partially <b>translucent</b> <b>green</b> (from which they derive {{a part of their}} taxonomic and common names) with a small fringe of scales which may appear red, orange, yellow or white on the crown of the head, framing the eyes. [...] L. viridis has longer legs, relative to the body, than most jumping spiders, with a smaller leap size (approximately three to four times their body length). However, L. viridis is similar to most other salticids in having highly complex eyes and well-developed vision that is amongst the most acute of all arthropods, as well as complex visual cognition behaviors; the anterior median eyes have the telephotic quality for which jumping spiders are known, but also share features with the eyes of species that evolved earlier than salticids.|$|R
