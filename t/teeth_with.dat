5|$|Earlier {{analyses}} {{had shown}} Kentrosaurus closer {{in the tree}} to Stegosaurus. Basal traits include a prominent paraquadratic foramen at the quadrate in the skull; maxillary <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> only seven denticles at the margin; and a shoulder spine.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due {{to the fact}} that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them {{to the bottom of the}} seafloor with its fins. The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny <b>teeth,</b> <b>with</b> the lower jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of various dental restoration materials on dose distribution in radiotherapy of head and neck cancer with 6 MV photon beam of a medical linac. Setting and Design: The dental restorations include <b>tooth,</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> amalgam, <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> Ni-Cr alloy, and <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> Ceramco. Dose perturbation due to the dental restorations on 6 MV beam of Siemens Primus linac was calculated by MCNPX Monte Carlo code. These dental materials were separately simulated in a cubic water phantom. Materials and Methods: Photon percentage dose change in the presence of <b>tooth,</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> amalgam, <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> Ni-Cr alloy, and <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> Ceramco was calculated at various depths on the central axis of the beam relative to the dose in water. In another evaluation, the absolute dose (cGy) for water, <b>tooth,</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> amalgam, <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> Ni-Cr alloy, and <b>tooth</b> <b>with</b> Ceramco was obtained by calculating 100 cGy dose at 0. 75 cm depth in the water phantom. Results: Based on the calculations performed, maximum percentage dose change due to backscattering was 11 %, 8 %, 6 %, and 4 % for amalgam, Ni-Cr alloy, Ceramco and tooth at depth of 0. 75 cm, respectively. The maximum dose perturbation by amalgam is due to its higher mass density and atomic number. Conclusion: Ignoring the effect of dental restoration compositions on dose distribution causes discrepancy in clinical treatment planning system calculations...|$|R

5|$|The jaws {{contained}} {{sharp teeth}} which were compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty. The teeth on the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of the upper jaw) were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) which had a straight posterior edge. The upper jaw bore 30 <b>teeth,</b> <b>with</b> each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower jaw held 22 teeth.|$|E

He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright <b>teeth,</b> <b>with</b> a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. His stance is casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time.|$|E
5|$|There is archeological {{evidence}} that humans {{have attempted to}} replace missing <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> root form implants for thousands of years. Remains from ancient China (dating 4000 years ago) have carved bamboo pegs, tapped into the bone, to replace lost teeth, and 2000-year-old remains from ancient Egypt have similarly shaped pegs made of precious metals. Some Egyptian mummies {{were found to have}} transplanted human teeth, and in other instances, teeth made of ivory.|$|E

5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in shallow grooves rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages; and the relatively limited contact between the lacrimal and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsia {{was coined}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs {{possessing}} certain characteristic features, including horns, a rostral bone, <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward-oriented pubis. Marsh considered the group distinct {{enough to warrant}} its own suborder within Ornithischia. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek κερας/keras meaning 'horn' and οψις/opsis meaning 'face'. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be Ceratopia. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only rarely in the scientific literature, {{and the vast majority of}} paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four <b>teeth,</b> <b>with</b> the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, {{which are}} composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E

5|$|The Anura {{include all}} modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. The {{characteristics}} of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, {{the presence of}} a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused, tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw without <b>teeth</b> (<b>with</b> the exception of Gastrotheca guentheri) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in Pipoidea), an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the lens of the eye. The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles.|$|E
5|$|The Tramp Dentists is a 1913 American silent short comedy film {{released}} by the newly formed Joker productions by the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. Directed by Allen Curtis, the film's cast includes Max Asher, Lee Morris, Eddie Boland Joseph Singleton and Bobby Vernon. The film is centered on two tramps, Dusty and Weary, who take over a dentist shop and get rich through their untrained dentistry, extracting <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> pincers and ice tongs. After earning {{a large amount of}} money, the tramps return to their old way of life. Released on October 29, 1913, this film was the second Joker comedy. The film received some criticism for its vulgar humor. The film had a wide national release in the United States, but the film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{is low and}} narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla {{compared}} to those of Tanystropheus. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla meet at the anteroventral (front bottom) corner {{and contribute to the}} border of the nostril, which is located at the anterior (front) end of a long recess that extends along the snout in front of the eye socket (the antorbital depression). The bottom margins of the two snout bones are respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw has fifteen preserved <b>teeth,</b> <b>with</b> three of them being fang-like. By comparison, the teeth in adult Tanystropheus are sharp pegs, while they are tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.|$|E

5|$|Two tramps, named Dusty and Weary, awake {{from their}} slumber in a hay stock and are {{overcome}} with thirst. The two drink from a horse trough and Dusty complains of toothache. The two {{go to the}} dentist office only to be kicked out. When the dentist departs on a cruise the two tramps then pose as dentists and occupy the office and pull <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> pincers and tongs. When the rightful owners return they drive off again. The tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life. The two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have <b>teeth</b> <b>with</b> broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
