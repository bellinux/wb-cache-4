5|$|One {{major change}} {{was made to}} the {{calculation}} for the general classification {{before the start of}} the second Giro d'Italia. Originally a point was given to each rider for his placing on each stage, but the organizers chose to give <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> who placed 1st through 50th in a stage.|$|E
5|$|René Pottier, {{the winner}} of the 1906 Tour de France, did not defend his title because he had {{committed}} suicide in early 1907. Although <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams. At the start of the race, it was expected that <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> sponsored by Alcyon and <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> sponsored by Peugeot would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: Louis Trousselier, Marcel Cadolle and Léon Georget; Peugeot counted on Emile Georget.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the horse, not <b>the</b> <b>rider,</b> is responsible for opening and closing <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> angles (notably, <b>the</b> hip and knee). As the horse takes off, it raises its upper body off the ground and comes closer to <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> This makes <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> hip angle (between the thigh and chest) close. Over <b>the</b> fence, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> keeps <b>the</b> angles closed. As the horse lands, it moves away from <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> body, which allows the hip angle to open and <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to become more perpendicular to the ground. Also, if the horse takes a jump wrong in some manner, due to rider error or other, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> may be thrown around a little bit and may sometimes get 'left behind', where <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> center of balance is behind that of the horse's. This can also throw the horse off balance and lead to other problems such as knocking down a rail.|$|R
2500|$|Sport <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> {{leans forward}} into {{the wind and the}} weight of the upper torso is {{supported}} by <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> core at low speed and air pressure at high speed (e.g., above [...] ). The footpegs are below <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> or to <b>the</b> rear. The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance and allows higher speeds. At low-speed this position throws the weight of <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> onto <b>the</b> arms, which can tire <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> wrists.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rider</b> {{is judged}} on a proper {{classical}} position. This includes evaluating leg position, seat, hands, balance, and rhythm. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> {{is to be}} relaxed and {{not interfere with the}} horse's movement, but able to make full use of all riding aids. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> and horse should have unity, and <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> should use <b>the</b> aids correctly and efficiently.|$|R
5|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} was a let down year {{not only for}} Durant {{but also for the}} Roughriders as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> stumbled out of the gate losing seven of their first eight games. Durant's production fell significantly through the course of the season. Near {{the end of the season}} Durant was playing with a broken bone in his foot, which ultimately lead to him missing the last two games of the regular season. <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> would finish the year with only 5 wins and 13 loses, placing them in last place in the league. Despite the reduced production in 2011 on April 27, 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> extended his contract through the 2014 CFL season.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 {{season was}} {{arguably the best}} season of Durant's career. He set career highs in touchdowns, with 31, while {{limiting}} his interceptions to only 12. He began the year having attempted 212 consecutive pass attempts without being intercepted joining Dave Dickenson and later Ricky Ray as the only quarterback in CFL history to start 7 consecutive games without throwing an interception. He also set a career-high for passer rating with 95.7 (excluding his 2006 season in which he only completed one pass). He led <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> to an 11-7 record and home-field in the Western Semi-Finals against the BC Lions where several of his rushing plays won the game for <b>the</b> <b>Riders.</b> After beating Calgary in the Western Final, Durant led <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> to their fourth Grey Cup championship on their home turf at Mosaic Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{stage of}} the race was the first hilly stage, with 23 {{categorised}} climbs. Many of these climbs (known as hellingen) feature in the Amstel Gold Race. It began in Riemst in the Belgian province of Limburg. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> completed {{one and a half}} laps of a circuit of the town; this included the first climb of the day, the Muizenberg. The course then left the town to the east, crossing the Halembaye, before crossing the border into the Dutch province of Limburg. As the route continued to the east, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> climbed the Heiweg, the Bergenhuizen, the Camerig and the Schuttebergsweg. The route then turned to the north, though it frequently turned back on itself to take in the various climbs. These included the Mamelisserweg, the Gulperbergweg, the Eyserbosweg, the Hulsberg, the Schanternelsweg, the Fromberg and the Sweikhuizerberg. After this, the route entered two and a half laps of a finishing circuit around Sittard-Geleen. On the two complete laps, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> climbed the Windraak, the Kollenberg, the Sittarderweg and the Weg langs Stammen. The golden kilometre came on the first lap between the last two of these climbs. After the two complete laps, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> climbed the Windraak once more, before finishing in Sittard-Geleen.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>rider</b> walked {{straight}} {{up to the}} trembling Wildfire. When Wildfire plunged and reared up and up <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> leaped for <b>the</b> bridle and with an iron arm pulled the horse down. Wildfire tried again, almost lifting <b>the</b> <b>rider,</b> but a stinging cut from the lasso made him come to a stand. Plainly <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> held <b>the</b> mastery.|$|R
5000|$|The ride {{starts in}} a darkened room with a voice over {{explaining}} the backstory. A light turns on, illuminating a door handle. Walking through <b>the</b> door, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> comes {{in front of the}} motel receptionist. They invite you to look at an old woman through a hole in a wall. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> is warned not to disturb any of the motel's guests. Continuing on through <b>the</b> corridor, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> comes to a casino, seen {{through a hole in the}} wall. There are various shouts. A face in the wall peers through at <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> Going past two room doors, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> come to a third, which is ajar. Going in, a woman in bed asks <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to get her husband out of the shower. In the bathroom, the husband jumps out at, shouting at <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to get out. The receptionist comes to calm the guests and chase <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> along. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> is shouted at by other guests. They then come to the ride loading area ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the ride}} starts, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> first {{comes to the}} room of Charlie, the {{maintenance}} worker, where his TV turns on suddenly, displaying static. Continuing on, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> comes {{in front of the}} furnace, and a large simulated fireball explodes in front of <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> In <b>the</b> next section, various different faces hang down. Finally, a face comes up on a screen in front of <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> and vomits up blood. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> then comes back into the loading area.|$|R
5|$|The race's {{penultimate}} day {{of racing}} {{was scheduled to}} go from Bari to Naples. During the stage, Lucien Petit-Breton crashed {{and was forced to}} abandon the race. The route had <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> go through rough roads that were heavy with dust and occasional passed over streams, thus flooding the roads. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> were also chase by enraged buffalo. All of those factors caused <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>riders</b> {{descend into}} {{a set of}} the Forbidden Forest where they {{encounter}} a figure of Aragog, a large, sentient spider who spits water at them. As Hermione tries to help <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> away from Aragog and towards the castle, encountering many spiders on the way, they encounter an animatronic Whomping Willow which swipes at them, knocking them into the Quidditch pitch. The ride returns to a projection screen as <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> become caught up in Harry's and Ron's game of Quidditch. As Slytherin scores into Gryffindor's goal, Dementors arrive at the Quidditch pitch and Harry attempts to lead <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> away through {{the structure of the}} pitch and back to the school, but their bench falls into the long-abandoned Chamber of Secrets through a cave entrance in a cliff which Harry, Ron, Ginny, Fawkes, and Gilderoy Lockhart departed through from the Chamber in the second Harry Potter installment. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> return to a real set as the Dementors appear from the pipelines and chase them. The skeleton of the long-deceased Basilisk lies {{on the floor of the}} Chamber, and expels Lord Voldemort's Dark Mark into the air as the benches are drawn into the mouth of Salazar Slytherin's statue.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> in the machines poinçonnées category {{had to use the}} same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
50|$|Xenophon {{then turns}} to the {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> For galloping, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> should lean slightly forward as the horse takes off, as the horse will be less likely to slip from under <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> When pulling <b>the</b> horse up, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> should lean back, which will lessen the shock of the sudden change in speed. Xenophon also suggests <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> loosen <b>the</b> reins and grab the mane when jumping a ditch or climbing an incline, so that he does not pull the horse in the mouth. Going down a steep incline, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> should throw himself straight backward and hold the horse with the bit.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rider</b> sits on <b>the</b> {{seat of the}} {{hydrofoil}} and is {{strapped in}} with a seat belt; their feet are strapped into bindings {{near the front of}} the board. When <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> is ready <b>the</b> boat will start to tow the skier. The water flowing past the hydrofoil wings generates lift, which can be controlled by <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to move <b>the</b> board up and down or side to side above the surface of <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> must be centered over the post of the hydrofoil; small body movements will cause great reactions with the hydrofoil. In order to [...] "float" [...] upward <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> leans back while maintaining balance to avoid pitching forward unexpectedly. To go back down <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> leans forward or pushes down with the feet. Turning is accomplished by pointing the knees in the direction desired; the hydrofoil will follow. To jump, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> leans even farther back. This will give <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> a somewhat stable base to perform aerial tricks for example.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Uno {{is controlled}} in forward motion by <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> shifting weight over {{the centre of}} gravity. When <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> shifts forward, <b>the</b> vehicle speeds up to regain balance, when <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> leans back, <b>the</b> vehicle slows. Steering is controlled by side-to-side motion of <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> <b>The</b> vehicle senses this shift and raises {{one of the two}} wheels to allow the vehicle to tilt in the desired turn direction.|$|R
5|$|As the peloton {{approached}} the Côte de la Redoute, {{there was a}} large crash. Among <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> to crash were two previous winners of the race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of the}} climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> who crashed attempted to get back into the peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of Dementors {{emerge from}} the {{darkness}} while one descends and attempts to suck out the riders' souls. This effect is achieved by projecting the riders' faces onto a cloud of fog {{in front of the}} Dementor, blasting cold air towards <b>the</b> <b>riders,</b> and using a heartbeat-like sound played through the sub-woofers built into the benches. After shaking <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> out of the trance, Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus Charm. After the final Dementor, and while Harry uses his Patronus, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> enter the final video dome segment, where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in. They fly over the Black Lake, back into Hogwarts and through the Main Hall and Grand Staircase, where they are cheered on by a series of onscreen characters from the movies who appear three-dimensional. Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement, where they exit their bench.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} stage, the organisers {{had made the}} option to {{postpone}} the start by two hours, in case the mistral wind was making cycling difficult. This was not necessary, so <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> started at midnight as planned.|$|E
50|$|Thompson played {{four seasons}} of college {{basketball}} at <b>the</b> <b>Rider</b> University, with <b>the</b> <b>Rider</b> Broncs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rider</b> {{should have}} an open chest with {{shoulders}} back. This helps to prevent <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> from collapsing forward and helps to center {{the weight of the}} upper body over the lower leg, therefore helping to keep <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> secure.|$|R
5000|$|Seat: {{the lowest}} {{part of the}} seat should also be the narrowest part of the saddle, the waist or twist, in order to balance <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> over <b>the</b> horse. When <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> is {{centered}} in the saddle, {{the length of the}} seat should allow about one hand's width both behind <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> seat and in front of the pelvis. A saddle that is too small is uncomfortable to ride in and does not allow <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> <b>the</b> security provided by sitting deep in the saddle. A saddle that is too big does not provide any support for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> and allows <b>the</b> seat to slide around too much. However, flap size and length of <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> thigh bone also influence the length of seat needed.|$|R
5|$|In {{the sixth}} stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped {{in the last}} kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the control post in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> would ride the final kilometre. At the moment that <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> arrived in Paris, it started to rain. The organisers decided {{together}} with the cyclists to exclude the final kilometre from the race, and make the control post in Ville-d'Avray {{the end of the}} race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} if riders tried {{crossing}} the Sierra Nevada in winter, {{but they certainly}} crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in Carson City, Nevada. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor {{at the time was}} about $0.43–$1 per day.|$|E
5|$|The 1907 {{race was}} also {{the first time that a}} car with bicycle repairmen drove behind <b>the</b> <b>riders,</b> to give {{assistance}} in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} section of his treatise, Xenophon {{describes}} the equipment for both the horse and <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> when riding into battle. For <b>the</b> <b>rider,</b> he mentions that the corselet should fit properly, and that <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> should use a Boeotian helmet.|$|R
25|$|Stirrup: part of {{the saddle}} in which <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> feet go; {{provides}} support and leverage to <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rider</b> {{was called}} “Confirmation of {{antitrust}} status of graduate medical resident matching programs” (Section 207). Neither <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> nor <b>the</b> then-ongoing Jung v. AAMC case was debated. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> was lobbied {{for by the}} AAMC and the American Hospital Association, and sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Senators Kohl, Feingold, and Bingaman publicly criticized {{the way in which}} <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> was added.|$|R
5|$|The SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge {{features}} vertical lifts and 90-degree turns providing <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> a 60-plus foot drop, {{a maximum}} speed of over 40 {{miles per hour}} and a 4.4 maximum G-force rating. The ride time is approximately two minutes and is the shortest Gerstlauer roller coaster built yet.|$|E
5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, {{a large amount of}} snow had {{accumulated}} on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for <b>the</b> <b>riders.</b> Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided {{to go ahead with the}} stage. As snow fell on <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|The prologue was a {{short and}} fairly flat circuit around Liège, with {{expected}} stage times to be about eight minutes. The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d'Avroy; <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> then headed north by the Boulevard d'Avroy and Boulevard de la Sauvenière. They then followed the Quai Roosevelt, along the Meuse, until the midway point when they returned on the opposite carriageway, before turning right towards Place Saint-Lambert, {{in front of the}} Palais des Princes-Évêques. From there, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> rejoined the original route on the opposite carriageway of Boulevard de la Sauvenière before the finish line located on Boulevard d'Avroy {{on the opposite side of}} the Parc d'Avroy from the start.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} ride in 2013 had no walkthrough section. In front of the queue, there was a mock newscast video with Jack Turner explaining the backstory. There were two queues: a normal speed queue and a FastPass queue. Coming in through the double doors, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> {{first came to the}} maintenance worker Charlie, whose vicious dog jumped up at <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> An old woman above <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> rocked back and forth seen through a caved in ceiling. Various faces hung down. Finally, a large simulated fireball blasted at <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> then came back into the loading area.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Vekoma premiered the Motorbike Coaster at the IAAPA expo. The {{reception}} was good, as {{it received}} the Award for [...] "Best Idea Euro Amusement Show 2004 - Paris" [...] at the Euro Amusement Show in Paris. The major difference with the normal sitdown rollercoaster is the positioning of <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b> Instead of <b>the</b> normal sitting seats, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> {{takes place in}} a seat that is more leaning forward, like an actual motorbike. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> can hold on to the 'steering wheel', and <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> is secured using a harness that pushes down on the back of <b>the</b> <b>rider.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{the flip}} of <b>the</b> board, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> may use <b>the</b> {{top of the}} front foot to alter the trick. In a Kickflip Underflip, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> reverses <b>the</b> {{direction}} of the spin after the board has flipped once. In a Hospital Flip, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> stops <b>the</b> rotation half-way, then flips the board 180 degrees on the axis pointing {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>rider's</b> feet so it lands right side up in the opposite direction.|$|R
