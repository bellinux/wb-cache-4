2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure {{from a second}} straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive. This controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve, signaling all of the [...] "apply" [...] or [...] "release" [...] magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously, changing the pressure in the [...] "straight air" [...] trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive. The relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms, magnet valves, electric control equipment, and an axle-mounted speed sensor, so that at speeds over [...] full braking force was applied, and reduced in steps at [...] , bringing the train to a gentle stop. [...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The [...] "straight air" [...] (electro-pneumatic trainline), [...] anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and {{any or all of}} these options could be supplied separately.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{controlling}} fuel flow for example with the dash-pot throttle lever. The throttle has a gear which meshes with <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the throttle and hence sliding the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is used to control pressure {{on one side of}} the throttle valve such that it gives the right opposition to the throttle control pressure. It does this by controlling the fuel outlet from within the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|In the 2nd stage of separation, {{the liquid}} with {{remaining}} gas flows along a horizontal section of pipe. The liquid {{level in the}} horizontal pipe is controlled {{in the middle of}} the pipe. The liquid level is controlled by a liquid level sensor in the horizontal pipe and a control valve in the gas run. As the liquid level rises in the horizontal pipe, the level sensor sends a signal to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and which begins to pinch shut to create some slight back pressure to push the liquid level down. Conversely, as liquid level goes goes down, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> beings to open to relieve pressure to allow the liquid level to rise. In essence, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> modulates to maintain the liquid level {{in the middle of the}} horizontal pipe. With a large gas/liquid interface area, thin gas-bearing emulsion layer and quiescent flow in the horizontal pipe, all contribute to the final removal of free gas bubbles from the liquid stream. All of the free gas removed in the horizontal section joins the gas run through a connecting run and is measured in the gas leg. The liquid, now free of gas drops to a liquid run for measurement.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} effect of these load disturbances, sensors and {{transmitters}} collect information about the process variable and its relationship to some desired set point. A controller will then process this information and decides what must be done to get the process variable back to where it should be after a load disturbance occurs. When all the measuring, comparing, and calculating are done, some type of final control element must implement the strategy selected by the controller. The most common final control element in the process control industries is <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> manipulates a flowing fluid, such as gas, steam, water, or chemical compounds, to compensate for the load disturbance and keep the regulated process variable {{as close as possible to}} the desired set point.|$|E

50|$|The {{main valve}} block {{is usually a}} stack of off the shelf {{directional}} control valves chosen by flow capacity and performance.

50|$|The {{fuel tank}} {{must first be}} {{pressurized}} by using the small hand-pump {{on the side of}} the stove. After pumping, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is opened just slightly, allowing a mix of fuel (drawn from the bottom of the tank) and pressurized air (drawn from the top of the tank) to reach the burner head. There, the mixture is ignited using a match or lighter. Once the flame burns steadily for 2 to 3 minutes and the burner head is sufficiently heated up, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is opened as far as possible. This cuts off the air from the tank, changing the mix to pure fuel. The heat of the burner head is then sufficient to vaporize the pure fuel prior to combustion. The size of the flame depends on the amount of pressure in the tank, which must be re-pressurized periodically using the hand pump.|$|E
5000|$|Open-loop: Pump-inlet and motor-return (via the {{directional}} valve) {{are connected}} to the hydraulic tank. The term loop applies to feedback; the more correct term is open versus closed [...] "circuit". Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow. The flow is returned to tank through the control valve's open center; that is, when <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is centered, it provides an open return path to tank and the fluid is not pumped to a high pressure. Otherwise, if <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is actuated it routes fluid to and from an actuator and tank. The fluid's pressure will rise to meet any resistance, since the pump has a constant output. If the pressure rises too high, fluid returns to tank through a pressure relief valve.

50|$|For the {{hydraulic}} fluid to do work, it must {{flow to the}} actuator and/or motors, then return to a reservoir. The fluid is then filtered and re-pumped. The path taken by hydraulic fluid is called a hydraulic circuit {{of which there are}} several types.Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow.

5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, {{the fuel tank}} must first be {{pre-heated}} and pressurized by lighting {{a small amount of}} fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank {{at the base of the}} vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan. [...] <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a cotton wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is opened by turning the adjusting key. This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a faucet (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.|$|E
