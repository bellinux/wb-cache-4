5|$|Anderson {{was chosen}} to {{participate}} in the 1984 Canada Cup. The roster included eight of Anderson's teammates from the Edmonton Oilers. Canada advanced to the finals and defeated Sweden 2–0 in a best of three series to win the Cup. Anderson scored five points during the tournament. The 1987 Canada Cup also saw Anderson participate. Once more, Canada reached the finals, but this time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against the Soviet Union. The finals required all three games as Canada defeated the Soviet Union. All three games needed overtime and had a final score of 6–5. Anderson recorded three points during the tournament.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012–13 Iraqi Premier League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Nazar Ashraf, Al-Talaba returned to their poor performance of the 2010–11 season, finishing in the 14th place with 35 points, only one point away from relegation, with only nine wins, eight draws, and 17 losses. They saved the club from being relegated in the 33rd round against Al-Naft where they won 2–1 and also because of Al-Kahraba's loss to Zakho in the last round. Al-Talaba passed the round of 32 of the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against Al-Zawra'a, drawing 0–0 in the first leg and winning 3–1 in the second leg before the tournament was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster {{in level flight}} than the Japanese fighters <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted {{to make sure that he}} had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe, naturally, {{could not}} answer this, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> against a much {{stronger}} bowling attack than their own. The openers Brendan Taylor and Stuart Carlisle survived 14 overs, scoring 62 runs, but Chris Cairns and Andre Adams inspired a collapse to 123 for 6. At one point, Zimbabwe threatened to break the record of highest ODI defeat ever (256 runs), but 45 from Heath Streak, including two sixes, took them past 200. Overall, 205 all out wasn't such a bad score. The problem {{was that they had}} been so utterly demolished in the first innings – and two days later, they were to meet India's feared batting line-up, including people like Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag.|$|E

Batting first, the Dutch were led to another big score after Bas Zuiderent made another century – this time unbeaten, for 116. Ryan ten Doeschate added 65 not out, while Tim de Leede also made 65, and the Dutch scored 287 for 4.

One lunar EVA was not a moonwalk, but rather a stand-up EVA partially out the top hatch of the LM, where it was thought that the extra height would help with surveying the area prior to conducting the moonwalks. Only three deep-space EVAs have ever been conducted, where the activity was neither on the lunar surface nor in Low Earth Orbit, but far away from both the Moon and the Earth.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} armed German halftracks {{belonging}} to an engineer company {{and followed by}} panzergrenadiers tried to attack the bridge at 1:30a.m., but the first was destroyed by a PIAT.

A more forceful German counter-attack came {{in the early hours}} of D-Day, when German divisional headquarters realised the bridges had been taken intact. By that time, Howard and his glider troops had been bolstered by both fresh airborne parachute landings The 2nd Ox and Bucks coup de main platoons holding the bridges were relieved by 7 Parachute Battalion at 03.00hrs. Later on D Day a detachment of British Commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade, led by Brigadier Simon Fraser, marched to the bridge to the tune of Bill Millin's bagpipes.

25|$|In {{the lone}} 2013 International Origin game, England thrashed their opponents by 20 points. At {{the end of}} the year, the 2013 World Cup was held in England and Wales. England, who were now known as the 'Wall of White', {{featured}} a new record of three brothers in their squad: Sam and twins George and Tom Burgess. England played their first game against Australia in Cardiff. England got off to a surprising early lead for many when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> 10–0 after 20 minutes. England, however, went on to lose in what was one of their best displays against the Kangaroos in years, losing 20–28. They then went on to thrash Ireland to nil in front of a record crowd in Huddersfield, in a game which saw Ryan Hall become the new England top try-scorer after a hat-trick took him to tally 17 total tries for his country. England also beat a determined Fiji in front a sold-out crowd at the KC Stadium to advance to the quarter-finals. They took on European rivals France in Wigan and after trailing 6–0 early, England went on to advance to the semi-finals to meet defending World Champions New Zealand at Wembley. It was a see-saw affair which saw England leading 18–14 with one minute on the clock remaining until New Zealand play-maker Shaun Johnson produced a historical moment to level the scores and then convert his try after the siren to win the match and make the Kiwis advance to a third consecutive World Cup Final. This was the first time England or Great Britain had lost to New Zealand in England since 2005.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 2006, Ohio State and Michigan met {{for their}} annual showdown, each {{carrying}} an 11–0 record. For {{the first time}} in the history of the rivalry, the two rivals faced off while holding the top two spots in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. Ohio State won the game by a score of 42–39 and became the outright Big Ten champion, earning the right to play for a national championship at the BCS National Championship Game in Glendale, Arizona. Michigan struck first with a touchdown run by junior running back Mike Hart, but the Buckeyes then scored 21 unanswered points, and at halftime, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> 28–14. Thanks to an interception and a fumble recovery by junior defensive tackle Alan Branch, Michigan made it 35–31 Ohio State with 14 minutes to go in the fourth quarter. But after appearing to have forced Ohio State into a fourth-down situation with six minutes to go, junior outside linebacker Shawn Crable was called for roughing the passer, giving the Buckeyes a fresh set of downs. Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith then passed to Brian Robiskie for a touchdown, increasing the Buckeyes' lead to 42–31 with five minutes remaining in the game. After Ohio State was called for pass interference on a failed fourth-down attempt, giving Michigan an automatic first down, junior quarterback Chad Henne found senior tight end Tyler Ecker for a 16-yard touchdown with two minutes to go to cut the OSU lead to 42–37. Senior wide receiver Steve Breaston caught the two-point conversion to bring the Wolverines within a field goal. Michigan needed to recover the ensuing onside kick, but they failed to do so. The Buckeyes ran out the clock for the victory, and a trip to the BCS national championship game. Troy Smith completed 71% of his passes for 316 yards and four touchdowns, essentially clinching the Heisman trophy. Ginn caught eight passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. Ohio State running back Antonio Pittman ran for 139 yards on 18 carries for a 7.7 yards-per-carry average. Michigan running back Mike Hart carried the ball 23 times for 142 yards and three touchdowns against a stout Buckeye defense. Chad Henne had 267 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers on a 60% completion percentage. Neither performance was, however, sufficient to turn the tide in favor of the Wolverines. The game was highly touted by ESPN/ABC (there was a game countdown clock for a week before kickoff) and was viewed by the largest television audience for a regular-season college football game since 1993, averaging 21.8 million viewers. The victory marked {{the first time in}} 43 years that the Buckeyes had won three consecutive games in the series. The game gained even more significance when, on the eve of the meeting, Michigan head coach and former Ohio State assistant coach Bo Schembechler died. Schembechler was honored with a video tribute at Ohio Stadium as well as a moment of silence before kickoff.|$|E
