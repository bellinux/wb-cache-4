5|$|Catholics {{who have}} {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> or consecrated life instead of marriage or single celibacy, as a state of life or relational vocation, include 54,559 male religious, 705,529 women religious.

5|$|Her {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> piety {{differed from}} the approach of her predecessors, as she was influenced by Jansenist ideas. The empress actively supported conversion to Roman Catholicism by securing pensions for converts. She tolerated Greek Catholics and emphasised their equal status with Roman Catholics.|$|E

5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
5|$|In the Remodernism manifesto, the Stuckists {{declared}} that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, {{a period of}} renewed spiritual (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>religious)</b> values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos have included Handy Hints, Anti-anti-art, The Cappuccino writer and the Idiocy of Contemporary Writing, The Turner Prize, The Decreptitude of the Critic and Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of modernity spirituality and {{religion}} are often used synonymously. To be spiritual was <b>to</b> be <b>religious</b> and <b>to</b> be <b>religious</b> was <b>to</b> be spiritual. Yet {{we now have a}} different understanding of spirituality, and why one can be both <b>religious</b> and spiritual, <b>to</b> be <b>religious</b> is not necessarily to be spiritual and to be spiritual does no...|$|R
50|$|Goolsby {{supported}} {{legislation in}} 2007 <b>to</b> permit <b>religious</b> expression in public schools. Signed {{into law by}} Governor Rick Perry, the measure allows students <b>to</b> express their <b>religious</b> beliefs in classroom assignments, to organize prayer groups and other religious clubs, and permits speakers at school events such as graduation ceremonies <b>to</b> mention <b>religious</b> viewpoints.|$|R

5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her {{the legal right to}} commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> freedom. Because the acquisition was not related <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E

5|$|As {{indicated}} in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E

5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured the {{fellowship}} in 1809 {{on the strength}} of a first. He disliked teaching – although he admitted it paid the bills – and much preferred being Principal. There, he would be eventually made Vice-Chancellor of the University and later Bishop of Chichester. Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the censure of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount. Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.|$|E

5000|$|In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson {{wrote that}} this freedom at least {{includes}} freedom of religious speech, including [...] "the right <b>to</b> entertain such <b>religious</b> beliefs {{as a person}} chooses, the right <b>to</b> declare <b>religious</b> beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right <b>to</b> manifest <b>religious</b> belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination." [...] Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Eighteenth Dynasty, only kings were buried within the valley in large tombs. When a non-royal person was buried, it was in a small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master. Amenhotep III's tomb was {{constructed}} in the Western Valley, and while his son Akhenaten moved his tomb's construction to Amarna, it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him. With the return <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> orthodoxy {{at the end of the}} Eighteenth Dynasty, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb returned to the royal necropolis.|$|E
5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> purposes.|$|E
5|$|FootTown's {{third and}} fourth floors house several tourist attractions. The third floor {{is home to the}} Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia {{depicting}} interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book. The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displays wax figures imported from London where they were made. The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> figures such as Jesus Christ. A hologram gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{relaxation}} of authoritarian political controls in 1946, {{large numbers of}} people began to call openly for a return <b>to</b> traditional <b>religious</b> practice. During the 1950s, even certain political leaders found it expedient <b>to</b> join <b>religious</b> leaders in advocating more state respect for religion.|$|R
50|$|The Government {{required}} several religious groups, apparently {{with the}} exception of Buddhists and Catholics, to report membership information periodically <b>to</b> the <b>Religious</b> Affairs Department of the LFNC. The Government also restricted the publication of religious materials that applied <b>to</b> most <b>religious</b> groups, again excepting Buddhists.|$|R
50|$|In many ancient {{legal systems}} (e.g. early Roman law), {{religious}} sites (e.g. temples) were considered {{property of the}} God or gods they were devoted <b>to.</b> However, <b>religious</b> pluralism makes it more convenient <b>to</b> have <b>religious</b> sites owned by the religious body that runs them.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E
5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Fr. Antonio Mateo, the Vicar of Tayabas, became {{suspicious}} of the cofradías monthly masses and fees, thus Fr. Manuel Sancho stopped holding Masses for the cofradía. Mateo and Sancho then accused the cofradía of conducting heretical activities. Due <b>to</b> <b>religious</b> persecution and {{the increasing number of}} its members, Pule decided to have the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied. Not discouraged, he then sought the approval of the Real Audiencia but he was also ignored.|$|E
