5|$|Surgeon and {{historian}} William Wilde recollected {{that as a}} medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest {{that in the early}} 19thcentury a plaster cast of a human face with a pig's snout was on display at the hospital. Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal, in the later half of the 19thcentury the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common. In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.|$|E
5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of the}} wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E

25|$|Although {{she became}} known first and {{foremost}} as an author, Tove Jansson considered her careers as author and painter to be of equal importance. She painted her whole life, changing style from the classical impressionism of her youth to the highly abstract modernist style of her later years. Jansson displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 1930s and early 1940s, and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943. Despite generally positive reviews, criticism induced Jansson to refine her style such <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 1955 solo exhibition her style had become less overloaded in terms of detail and content. Between 1960 and 1970 Jansson held five more solo exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|His lifework {{was based}} on his {{conviction}} that the Church was founded by God and entrusted {{with the task of}} embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the only law; <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> capacity as a divine institution, she is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the Church, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God: or, in other words, a defection from Christianity. But any attempt to interpret this in terms of action would have bound the Church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states.|$|E

25|$|Critic Randy Rasmussen {{suggests}} that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin. For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits {{one of his own}} (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.|$|E
25|$|Boyer {{told the}} police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She claimed that after they left a local nightclub together, she had {{repeatedly}} requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She claimed that once {{in one of the}} motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and that she was certain he was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for a moment, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She claimed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called police.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{converted}} to non-drafting triathlon racing Luxford began competing in Life Time Fitness Triathlon Series (amongst other races), securing numerous podium finishes. She also took second {{place at the}} 2012 Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. She then began branching out to longer distance races, including the Ironman 70.3 race series. In December 2012, in her first half Ironman distance event, she took first place at Ironman 70.3 in Canberra and then she took first place at the Ironman 70.3 Asia-Pacific Championship in Auckland in February 2013. Luxford continued her strong 2013 season with a second-place finish at the Ironman 70.3 European Championship in Wiesbaden and a third place a month later at the 2013 Ironman 70.3 World Championship. The following year, in 2014, against strong, competitive fields she took 2nd place at both the Ironman 70.3 Asia-Pacific Championship and at the Abu Dhabi International Triathlon. She also claimed the Ironman 70.3 Australian Championship title in Mandurah; however, a collision with a car whilst training meant <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> second 70.3 World Championship appearance {{she was unable to}} match her finish from the previous year, finishing 11th in Mont-Tremblant. In 2015, Luxford began working part-time in digital communications at the National Australia Bank in Melbourne whilst continuing training and competing. That year she competed in her first Ironman, finishing 6th at Ironman Asia-Pacific Championship in Melbourne and raced as a rookie at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, finishing 12th. She also competed successfully in 70.3 and Challenge Half events, winning Ironman 70.3 events in Western Sydney and Ballarat.|$|E
