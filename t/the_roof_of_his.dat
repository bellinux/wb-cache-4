5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|Debby also dropped up to 12inches (30.5mm) of {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico {{in less than}} 48hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3inches (7.62mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63inches (32mm) in RÃ­o Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16inches (31mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17inches (43mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5inches (127mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor car accidents. There were 406homes affected from the flooding, 5of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly {{responsible for the death}} of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a satellite dish from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home.|$|E
5|$|Across much of Luzon, Irma {{flattened}} {{houses and}} flooding streets, resulting in considerable damage. Irma brought down power lines, {{which led to}} blackouts along the suburbs of Manila. One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dwelling in Makati. Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris. For instance, two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after {{being hit by a}} falling coconut. Elsewhere on Midoro Island, 60 homes were destroyed. Offshore, eighteen fisherman were listed as missing. Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila while 12others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris. Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila. Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two location were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees. In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants {{on the banks of the}} Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts. In a nearby park, the typhoon blew down houses, power poles, billboards and trees. Even though the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, both United States-run, sustained little damage, six C-130 transports had to be evacuated to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and ships, including the aircraft carrier Constellation. Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos ordered the closure of all government offices in affected areas, which included the capital city of Manila. Additionally, many private offices sent their employees home.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} that Nedim died in 1730 during the Janissary revolt {{initiated}} by Patrona Halil, but there are conflicting stories as to the manner of his death.

Another story, however, claims that he {{died as a result of}} excessive drinking, while a third story relates how Nedim â terrified by the tortures enacted upon Ibrahim Pasha and his retinue â suddenly died of fright.

25|$|As {{a policy}} of {{controlling}} and rewarding his generals, Mari Djata adopted their sons. These children were raised at the mansas court and became Keitas upon reaching maturity. Seeing the throne as their right, two adopted sons of Mari Djata waged a devastating war against one another that threatened to destroy what the first two mansas had built. The first son to gain the throne was Mansa Ouati Keita (also spelt Wati) in 1270. He reigned for four years, spending lavishly and ruling cruelly, according to the djelis. Upon his death in 1274, the other adopted son seized the throne. Mansa Khalifa Keita is remembered as even worse than Ouati Keita. According to the djelis, he governed just as badly, was insane and fired arrows from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> palace at passers by. Ibn Khaldun recounts that the people rushed upon him and killed him during a popular revolt. The Gbara replaced him with Manding Bory Keita in 1275.|$|E
25|$|Seven weeks later, on 21 September a {{party of}} Defenders was routed by a smaller but better armed {{coalition}} of 'wreckers' at the Diamond, 4 miles from Drumcree. The 'wreckers' were {{under the command of}} a Captain Giffard from Dublin. William Blacker, a member of the landed gentry and commander of the Seagoe Yeomanry, was later attributed a role in the affray. He is said to have stripped lead from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house to make ammunition in preparation for the ambush of Catholic Defenders at the Diamond. However, we could find nothing to support this and it may be no more than a piece of Orange legend that helped establish an affinity with the aristocracy {{in the minds of the}} Protestant peasantry. It was after the Diamond skirmish that the name 'Orange Boys' was adopted. This was changed to 'the Orange Order' as the âwreckersâ became more organised under the leadership of Blacker and James Verner, an attorney and agent for the Armagh estates of absentee landlord, Lord Charlemont.|$|E

A few more steps would be all that he could take in this direction without drowning. Could he retrace his way against the swift current? He did not know. He was weakened from the effects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wound, from lack of food and from the exertions of the past hour. Well, he would go on as far as he could. The river lay ahead of him somewhere.

Just then Max pulls into the parking space which Sandra believed to have finally found {{after half an hour}} of searching. After a heated discourse she finally arrives at her office, late for an appointment with a client. That client is Mrs Marangoni, who wants to file for divorce after her husband has left her. Believing he is cheating on her, she is seeking revenge. Sandra reveals her own recent disappointment with her ex-boyfriend, and the two women quickly bond. Unbeknownst to Sandra, her clientâs husband is no one other than Max, with whom she had just been fighting over the parking space.|$|R
50|$|In October 1978 Constable Jim Blackwood of the RCMP {{witnessed}} a sighting of {{a flying saucer}} hovering over the harbour {{near the town of}} Clarenville and Random Island. This was reported to him by local citizens. When he arrived at the scene the UFO was still present and quite visible. He had a special high powered viewing scope which happened to be on loan at the time for other surveillance. The craft stayed in the area for approximately an hour and a half. When he switched on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> lights <b>of</b> <b>his</b> police cruiser the craft appeared to mimic the flashing lights. This made headline news at the time and was broadcast on CBC television and NTV broadcasting in Newfoundland. The craft took off like a shooting star high in the sky and disappeared. Two years after the incident the BBC did a documentary on UFO sightings and included the Clarenville sighting in their broadcast. In later years Cst Blackwood retired to his native home in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.|$|R
