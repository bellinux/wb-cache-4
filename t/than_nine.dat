5|$|During the {{war between}} June 1941 and January 1942, the Nazis killed an {{estimated}} 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war.

50|$|WIN in South Australia, {{like its}} {{services}} in other states, was primarily {{an affiliate of}} the Nine Network. However, in September 2007, WIN Television announced plans to convert the station into a sole Seven Network affiliate, due to a disagreement with the Nine Network's owner, PBL Media, over affiliation advertising revenue. As {{a result of the}} switch, today, alongside the local news updates, WIN SA broadcasts Seven News and Today Tonight from SAS in Adelaide rather <b>than</b> <b>Nine's,</b> as well as Seven's national newscasts and Sunrise.|$|R

5|$|Shorter hydroperiods {{of three}} or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other {{microscopic}} organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E

One highlight, though it did not count in the standings, was the Mayor's Trophy Game on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.|$|E

5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi was {{transported to}} {{hospital}} with severe head injuries, and {{was moved to}} his native France in November. He remained there until his death more <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> months later on 17 July 2015, when he was mourned by the motor sport community. Bianchi's accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel {{in which it was}} determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash. The victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, who was 63 points in front of Daniel Ricciardo. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari in the battle for third place with four races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|By mintages, the {{key dates}} {{in this series}} are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been {{extensively}} melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, although more <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E

5|$|Deusdedit (died c. 664) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury, the first {{native-born}} holder of the see of Canterbury. By birth an Anglo-Saxon, he became archbishop in 655 {{and held the}} office for more <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> years until his death, probably from plague. Deusdedit's successor as archbishop {{was one of his}} priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit's death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he was considered to be a saint after his demise. A saint's life was written after his relics were moved from their original burial place in 1091.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia's batsmen had {{relatively}} little difficulty against the hosts' attack. England's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line-up he managed only 18 wickets at 38.22. Alec Coxon, Dick Pollard, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support. Jim Laker, Jack Young, Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action. Bedser {{was the only}} English bowler to take more <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> wickets. Morris led the runscoring and century-making with 696 runs at 87.00 and three triple-figure scores, supported by Bradman (508 at 72.57) and Barnes (329 at 82.25). With the first three batsmen in such form, Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings, averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets.|$|E
5|$|The 1790 {{constitution}} {{abolished the}} council and replaced the president with a governor, and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved {{the start of the}} term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms. There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total {{as long as there is}} a four-year break after a second term.|$|E
