5000|$|How {{it works}} [...] - Multiple <b>disk</b> <b>clutches</b> operate via an {{electrical}} actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current is applied through the clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. These lines of flux are transferred {{through the small}} air gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts both the armature and <b>friction</b> <b>disks.</b> The attraction of the armature compresses (squeezes) the <b>friction</b> <b>disks,</b> transferring the torque from the in inner driver to the out disks. The output disks are connected to a gear, coupling, or pulley via drive cup. The clutch slips until the input and output RPMs are matched. This happens relatively quickly typically (0.2 - 2 sec).|$|R
50|$|The {{input of}} the clutch is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft, chain, or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has <b>friction</b> and <b>clutch</b> <b>disks</b> stacked together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|R

The dependence of the wear of the restorated disks upon the total kilometres logged has been obtained, the life time of the restorated disks constituted 216 thous. km.

50|$|Introduction - Multiple <b>disk</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are used}} to deliver {{extremely}} high torque in a relatively small space. These clutches can be used dry or wet (oil bath). Running the clutches in an oil bath also greatly increases the heat dissipation capability, which makes them ideally suited for multiple speed gear boxes and machine tool applications.|$|R

50|$|Motorcycles of {{the same}} period, through to the 1950s, that used girder forks also used <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> shock absorbers. These were often {{provided}} with a large handwheel, {{so that they could}} be adjusted easily during a ride, or even whilst in motion.|$|R
50|$|When {{the current}} {{is removed from}} the clutch, the {{armature}} is free to turn with the shaft. Springs hold the <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> away from each other, so there is no contact when the clutch is not engaged, creating a minimal amount of drag.|$|R
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a pressure plate, squeezing the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> between the inner pressure plate and the outer cover plate. This frictional clamping force is transferred to the hub, which is mounted to a shaft.|$|R
50|$|A {{cone clutch}} serves {{the same purpose}} as a <b>disk</b> or plate <b>clutch.</b> However, instead of mating two {{spinning}} <b>disks,</b> the cone <b>clutch</b> uses two conical surfaces to transmit torque by friction.|$|R
40|$|Although the false-twisting {{by means}} of a <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> unit is an {{efficient}} technique widely applied to manufacture the synthetic fiber yarns conventionally called `textured yarns', the fundamental mechanics operating in the processing, especially the relationship between frictional and extensional forces and paths which a yarn experiences when twisted, is not sufficiently in vestigated to date. This series of reports aims to establish a theory that describes the mechanical behaviors of a yarn in the false-twisting process using a <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> unit, and to obtain basic information about the yarn path and the frictional forces acting on the yarn. In the theoretical part of this article, the forces balance equations, which determined a yarn path contacting with the toric surface of a single false-twisting-disk unit, were developed on the basis of differential geometry of curved surfaces. In the experimental part, the path shape of a yarn contacting with the toric surface of twisting disk was photographed and simultaneously the yarn tension was measured under several combinations of processing conditions : the yarn entrance direction and feed velocity, the rotational speed of the twisting disk, etc. The data obtained coincided fairly with analytical estimations and the presented scheme was confirmed to be valid for predicting the behaviors of a yarn in the false-twisting processing using a <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> unit...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic shock {{absorbers}} {{appeared as a}} development to replace the previous <b>friction</b> <b>disks.</b> These had, at best, provided a constant damping force, {{no matter what the}} size or speed of the suspension movement.

The quality of false-twist textured yarn from <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> spindles is very strongly influenced by unit operating conditions and untwisting tension. The authors previously proposed a method to derive tension and untwisting tension in the yarn given the twisting tension and yarn path in double-stack <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> units. In this study our goal was to calculate both yarn path and yarn tension. We were able to compare and confirm that the calculated yarn path and yarn tension closely matches experimental results. In addition, we succeeded in using our model to predict conditions for guide hole to produce false-twist yarn. The validity of our model was proven by the results. We have succeeded {{for the first time in}} calculating approximate yarn path and yarn tension for the false-twist process in <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> spindle units.

50|$|Lever arm shock {{absorbers}} {{were the first}} form of hydraulic shock absorber or damper used for car suspension. They appeared in the 1930s and were most commonly used in the 1950s and 1960s, but were replaced by telescopic {{shock absorbers}} in the 1970s.

40|$|The {{friction}} transmission {{model of}} wet clutch is established {{to analyze the}} friction transmission mechanism of its engagement. The model is developed by applying both the average flow model and the elastic contact model between the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> and separator plate. The key components during wet clutch engagement are the separator plate, <b>friction</b> <b>disk,</b> and lubricant. The one-dimension transient models of heat transfer in radial direction for the three components are built {{on the basis of}} the heat transfer theory and the conservation law of energy. The friction transmission model and transient heat transfer models are coupled and solved by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method, and the radial temperature distribution and their detailed parametric study for the three components are conducted separately. The simulation results show that the radial temperature for the three components rises with the increase of radius in engagement. The changes in engagement pressure, lubricant viscosity, friction lining permeability, combined surface roughness RMS, equivalent elasticity modulus, difference between dynamic and static friction coefficients, and lubricant flow have important influence on the temperature rise characteristics. The proposed models can get better understanding of the dynamic temperature rise characteristics of wet clutch engagement...|$|R
50|$|The 1906 Lambert model A runabout {{came with}} a {{wheelbase}} of 78 in, gauge 56 in. It was a 2 passenger automobile. The wheels were 30 in in diameter by 3.5 in wide.

50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|R

50|$|Electro-mechanical disk brakes operate via {{electrical}} actuation, but transmit torque mechanically. When {{electricity is}} applied to the coil of an electromagnet, the magnetic flux attracts the armature to the face of the brake. As it does so, it squeezes the inner and outer <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> together. The hub is normally mounted on the shaft that is rotating. The brake housing is mounted solidly to the machine frame. As the disks are squeezed, torque is transmitted from the hub into the machine frame, stopping and holding the shaft.|$|R
50|$|The <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> {{material}} was usually a wooden disk {{between the two}} faces of the steel arms.
