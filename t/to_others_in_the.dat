In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E

25|$|One view of {{difference}} between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself {{but in order to}} be embarrassed one's actions must be revealed <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate {{as to whether or not}} shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others.|$|E

25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Ephraim {{a son of}} Joseph, from whom it took its name; however some critical Biblical scholars view this also as postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Israelite confederation. In the Biblical account, Joseph {{is one of the}} two children of Rachel and Jacob, a brother to Benjamin, and father to both Ephraim, and his first son, Manasseh; Ephraim received the blessing of the firstborn, although Manasseh was the eldest, because Jacob foresaw that Ephraim's descendants would be greater than his brother's.|$|E

The pair had betrayed Lovestone, however, revealing the plot <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party — a decision which put the two back in good graces with the Communist International when the Lovestone group was purged from the party organization later in 1929.|$|E

25|$|Wealth, status, and {{political}} influence were interrelated. The king allotted rice fields to court officials, provincial governors, military commanders, in payment {{for their services}} to the crown, according to the sakdi na system. The size of each official's allotment {{was determined by the}} number of commoners or phrai he could command to work it. The amount of manpower a particular headman, or official, could command determined his status relative <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hierarchy and his wealth. At the apex of the hierarchy, the king, who was symbolically the realm's largest landholder, theoretically commanded the services of the largest number of phrai, called phrai luang (royal servants), who paid taxes, served in the royal army, and worked on the crown lands.|$|E

Here the blessing of the first son was conferred by a grandfather rather than by the father, despite prevailing custom (great patriarchs supersede custom).|$|E
25|$|The Oaxaca {{version of}} alebrijes differ {{not only by}} being smaller and carved from wood, but the figures {{generally}} are more recognizable as a single animal such as lions, jaguars, iguanas, dragons, dogs, snakes, rather than an amalgam of various animal parts. The {{reason for this is}} that there is a long Zapotec tradition of the carving of wooden figures. The first to develop Oaxaca alebrijes was Manuel Jiménez Ramírez of Arrazola, who created them for over thirty years before his death, using soft copal wood which is still preferred. He then painted them in bright colors and with intricate designs. He was followed by Santos Pinos and then the craft spread <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town. It was similar in San Martín Tilcajete, where a few pioneering families started the trend there. The two towns originally began selling to tourists but eventually the pieces became collectors’ items that are now sold in shops and galleries in the US and other countries.|$|E

25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Gad the seventh son of Jacob, from whom it took its name. However, some Biblical scholars view this {{also as a}} postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Israelite confederation. In the Biblical account, Gad {{is one of the}} two descendants of Zilpah, a handmaid of Jacob, the other descendant being Asher; scholars see this as indicating that the authors saw Gad and Asher as being not of entirely Israelite origin (hence descendants of handmaids rather than of full wives). In common with Asher is the possibility that the tribal name derives from a deity worshipped by the tribe, Gad being thought by scholars to be likely to have taken its name from Gad, the semitic god of fortune; the name of Gad does not appear in the Song of Deborah, which scholars regard as one of the oldest parts of the Bible, pre-dating most of the Torah.|$|E
25|$|Since every {{household}} {{was almost}} entirely self-sufficient, {{there was very}} little need for trade. Goods and services were exchanged, but a household's survival did not depend on it. In the course of bringing in various resources, it was natural that a given household would reap a windfall of a particular resource, be it a large harvest of apricots, wheat, or a large bison that was brought back by the hunters, etc. When a household found itself with a plentiful supply of a particular resource, it did not necessarily mean that the surplus would be traded in the modern sense of the word, but rather, the surplus would probably be given away <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community who could use whatever resource they had on hand, with no thought of reciprocation or direct realized return {{on the part of the}} gifters. This is the basis of a gift economy, which has been observed in many hunter-gatherer or subsistence farmer cultures, and that was most likely the same with the Cucuteni-Trypillia society, at least during the early period of the culture.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a social}} {{identity}} approach, Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens). Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural {{environment in which}} one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected <b>to</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of prosocial behaviors and values, including: intergroup empathy, valuing diversity, social justice, environmental sustainability, intergroup helping, and a felt responsibility to act. Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components, perception of one’s global knowledge, college professors' attitudes toward global citizenship, belief in an intentional worlds view of culture, participation in a fan group that promotes the identity, use of global citizen related words when describing one's values, possible self as a global citizen, religiosity and religious orientation, threat to one’s nation, interdependent self-construal prime, perception of the university environment, and social media usage.|$|E
