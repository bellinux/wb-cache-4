The teams may have their origins in the perceived need to make primarily strategic decisions, tactical decisions, or operational decisions, but they will require all three types of information.

A novel semi-autonomous human-robot system where the robot requires only high-level commands from the human <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>its</b> <b>tasks</b> is proposed. In this system a Morse code inspired but relatively more flexible and robust communication technique generates such high-level commands from Electromyogram (EMG) signals. The proposed framework has been implemented to develop a prototypical human-robot interaction system. Initial results from preliminary human subject experiments are encouraging and demonstrative of the advantages of such a human-robot framework...|$|R

Immune systems are adaptive because populations of individuals change in response to environmental signals. For example, activated B cells produce a large and variable population of daughter B cells.
