5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

50|$|The {{downstream}} fishway was not operated {{from the}} completion of the dam in December 2005 until February 2009 due to water levels in the dam being beneath the entrance of the fishway. Since the dam commenced operation, the upstream and downstream fishways have not operated for approximately 60% of the time due to a combination of low water levels, mechanical failure, and being shut-down. Operation of the fishway has been limited to only <b>those</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> there are low and medium flow releases.|$|R

The National War Memorial of Canada has been the site of Canada's annual National Remembrance Day celebration since 1939, the only exception being <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> construction near the site precluded it. Annual Armistice Day celebrations also take place at Vernon March's Cenotaph war memorial in Cape Town, South Africa and include wreath-laying ceremonies and processions.|$|E
25|$|The perp walk arose {{incidentally}} {{from the}} need to transport a defendant from a police station to court after arrest, and the general prohibition of prior restraint under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Law enforcement agencies often coordinate with the media in scheduling and arranging them. It has been criticized {{as a form of}} public humiliation that violates a defendant's right to privacy and is prejudicial to the presumption of innocence, but is defended as promoting transparency in the criminal justice system. American courts have permitted it {{on the grounds that it}} arises from the limitations and necessity of police procedure, but have also limited it only to <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> it is actually necessary.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{took time}} to rally more men and prepare. By the {{following}} spring, Charles had attracted enough support to invade Neustria. Charles sent an envoy who proposed a secession of hostilities if Chilperic would recognize his rights as mayor of the palace in Austrasia. The refusal was not unexpected but served to impress upon Martel's forces the unreasonableness of the Neustrians. They met near Cambrai at the Battle of Vincy on 21 March 717. The victorious Martel pursued the fleeing king and mayor to Paris, but as he was not yet prepared to hold the city, {{he turned back to}} deal with Plectrude and Cologne. He took the city and dispersed her adherents. Plectrude was allowed to retire to a convent; Theudoald lived to 741 under his uncle's protection, a kindness—unusual for <b>those</b> <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> mercy to a former gaoler, or a potential rival, was rare.|$|E

But I would not see them as having been built {{because there was a}} state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{describe}} a [...] "tortured romantic scenario" [...] of a newly formed couple's relationship, which, according to McCall, is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements. Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals. It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further anytime soon, want to take things slow, and are satisfied with [...] "just a goodnight kiss". McCall {{also noted that the}} lyrics portray how the female character's lines, sung by Scott, attempt to fight back her lustful feelings, and precariously sighs the line [...] "I don't want to mess this thing up." [...] Scott told Billboard that [...] "there is so much excitement {{at the beginning of a}} new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic feeling that this person could be 'the one'. This song is about one of <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> your brain kicks in and tells your heart 'good things are worth waiting for.'" [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song's production is [...] "emblematic of the album's midtempo complacency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings [...] "give a nice lift at the end." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 2, 1906, Saint-Gaudens {{wrote to}} Shaw, enquiring whether a high relief was {{practical}} on coins struck at the Mint. [...] Shaw {{did not immediately}} reply, but instead met with Roosevelt, who wrote {{that there was no}} objection to have the coins, many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated, [...] "as artistic as the Greeks could desire". Roosevelt secured Shaw's support for the redesign, although as the President wrote to Saint-Gaudens, [...] "of course he thinks I am a crack-brained lunatic on the subject". [...] Shaw wrote to the sculptor on , reproducing a copy of a letter from Roberts which warned, [...] "the judgement of the authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief", but as the President disagreed with Roberts's view, Saint-Gaudens could go ahead with a high-relief design. [...] Numismatic historian Roger W. Burdette commented, [...] "This is also one of <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the compelling egos of artist and President might have paid greater attention to director Roberts' comments. [...] By continuing with the design in a relief that was not coinable, Saint-Gaudens lost his best chance to explore the limits of artistry on circulation coinage." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill forts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, roughly {{the start of the}} first millenniumBC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze. As a result, trading patterns shifted, and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that [...] " [...] provided defensive possibilities for the community at <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the stress [...] burst out into open warfare.

About this prayer, Bahá'u'lláh has stated: [...] "...the long Obligatory Prayer should be said at <b>those</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> one feeleth himself in a prayerful mood.

[...] The text of the long obligatory prayer can be found in Bahá'u'lláh's Prayers and Meditations. This prayer is known in Arabic as salat and as namaz in Persian, and is similar to the Islamic salat.|$|E
