5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved road haulage and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site of the goods yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b> Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E
50|$|The terms trickle filter, {{trickling}} biofilter, biofilter, {{biological filter}} and biological trickling filter {{are often used}} <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickling</b> filter. These systems have also been described as roughing filters, intermittent filters, packed media bed filters, alternative septic systems, percolating filters, attached growth processes, and fixed film processes.|$|R

25|$|Largely {{forgotten}} {{by the public}} by the 1980s, Scott suffered a major stroke in 1987 that left him unable to work or engage in conversation. His recordings were largely out of print, his electronic instruments were cobweb-collecting relics, and his once-abundant royalty stream had slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sales slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> in {{the wake}} of the {{introduction}} of the Renault Alliance. These were more modern, space-efficient, fuel-efficient 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive cars compared to the rear-drive Concord with its aging platform. The imported Renault 18-based 18i sedan Sportwagon sold by AMC/Jeep/Renault dealers were also more efficient replacements. All Concord and Spirit models were quietly dropped by the end of the 1983 model year. The future for AMC's Concord and Spirit series was sealed for the 1980s as rear-drive cars were replaced by front-drive models.|$|E

25|$|The Nixon administration, {{looking for}} a way out, pursued a less {{restrained}} course under the brief but devastating Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II bombing raids. These attacks removed many of the restrictions upon previous American targeting, seeded Northern waters with mines that cut Soviet and Chinese imports <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> exhausted national air-defenses and crippled whatever significant remaining industrial plant and transportation network was left in the North. LINEBACKER caused more damage to Northern lines of communication, than the previous 3 years of ROLLING THUNDER, particularly as the Easter Offensive brought communist forces out into the open.|$|E
25|$|Hardheads fourth war patrol {{included}} a special mine-laying mission. She sailed 20 March 1945 and laid mines off French Indochina {{during the night}} of 2 April. The submarine then entered the Gulf of Siam, where after several attacks she sank cargo ship Araosan Maru 6 April. Following a visit to Subic Bay to reload 11 April – 15 April she patrolled the South China Sea, but found few contacts. American submarines had by this time reduced Japanese merchant activity <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> effectively destroying the island nation's lifeline to the outside world. Hardhead returned to Fremantle 16 May.|$|E
25|$|As {{the events}} of the wars of Yugoslav {{succession}} (1991–95 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a barely noticed casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the Kosovo campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> in 1991-92 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on Slobodan Milosević’s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced prices or written off altogether as economically unviable.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the housing}} market has boomed in Philadelphia, the {{neighborhood}} has begun to see some resurgence.

25|$|The changes {{altered the}} ethnic {{character}} of the burgher classes. The peasant influx into towns slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> while the proportion of Jewish inhabitants increased considerably. Of the 750,000 Jews living in the Commonwealth {{in the middle of}} the 18th century (other sources give about a million in the 1770s), 3/4 resided in cities, making up almost half of the total urban population. The Jews were very industrious, accepted even marginal profits and soon dominated the crafts and trade, especially in smaller towns. Their communities (Qahal autonomous congregations) conducted extensive credit operations, servicing the Polish middle and upper social strata. Christian townspeople had made at times unsuccessful attempts to limit the commercial rights of the Jews.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} stream of East Germans fleeing across the Inner German border to West Germany placed great strains on East German-West German relations in the 1950s. East Germany sealed the borders to West Germany in 1952, but people continued to flee from East Berlin to West Berlin. On 13 August 1961, East Germany began building the Berlin Wall around West Berlin to slow the flood of refugees <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> effectively cutting the city in half and making West Berlin an enclave of the Western world in communist territory. The Wall became {{the symbol of the}} Cold War and the division of Europe. Shortly afterward, the main border between the two German states was fortified.|$|E
25|$|One of Broad's first {{challenges}} as an incoming minister was {{to deal with}} the fate of the Snowy River, which had diminished <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> as a result of being dammed for various purposes. Though it had been an environmental issue for many years, it became of particular concern to the Bracks government, as the issue was central to the support of independent Craig Ingram, who they relied on to retain a majority in parliament. It fell to Broad, as the relevant minister, to handle negotiations on the issue with both the federal and New South Wales state governments. Despite the involvement of a number of conflicting interests, a major agreement was reached between the three parties in October 2000. This saw A$160 million put towards regenerating the river, with the intention of increasing its water flow to 28% of its original capacity.|$|E

50|$|The 25th Army Tank Brigade was reconstituted {{at the end}} of 1940, and its regiments began <b>to</b> receive <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> {{of tanks}} on which to train. By the end of 1942, 51 RTR was fully trained and fully {{equipped}} with Churchill tanks. In January 1943, the regiment embarked with 25th Tank Brigade for North Africa, where it came under the command of British First Army in the Tunisia Campaign.|$|R
5000|$|This {{movement}} {{begins at}} a relaxed tempo and is slightly less upbeat and allegro than other first movements to symphonies, such as Milhaud's Symphony No.1. The basic {{analysis of this}} symphony {{is based on a}} recording by the Orchestra of Radio Luxembourg. The first movement has a very flowy, pastoral texture, with the harp playing a significant role. The harp could be compared <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickling</b> stream during the springtime, due to the numerous, continuous, thirty-second notes that at times were arpeggiated for the entirety of the movement. With the harp, the woodwinds take control of the melody, whereas the strings involved do not {{play a significant role in}} this particular movement, as they only play basic quarter note and half note rhythms throughout. The cello has some pizzicato sections which adds to the texture of the piece.|$|R
25|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the sinking, engineers used ROVs to seal cracks in the tanker's hull, now 4000 meters below the sea surface, and slowed the leakage <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> of 20 litres a day. By 2004, engineers had removed the oil still in the tanker by drilling small holes in the wreck, using remotely operated submersible vehicles (ROVs) {{like the one that}} originally explored the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The oil was then pumped into large aluminium shuttles, specially manufactured for this salvage operation. The filled shuttles were then floated to the surface. The original plan to fill large bags with the oil proved to be too problematic and slow. After the oil removal was completed, a slurry rich in microbiologic agents was pumped in the hold to speed up the breakdown of any remaining oil. The total estimated cost of the operation was over €100 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the inner German border {{took place in a}} number of stages between 1945 and the mid-1980s. After its establishment in 1945 as the dividing line between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of Germany, in 1949 the inner German border became the frontier between the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany). The border remained relatively easy to cross until it was abruptly closed by the GDR in 1952 in response to the large-scale emigration of East Germans to the West. Barbed-wire fences and minefields were installed and draconian restrictions were placed on East German citizens living near the border. Thousands were expelled from their homes, with several thousand more fleeing to the West. From the late 1960s, the border fortifications were greatly strengthened through the installation of new fences, detectors, watchtowers and booby-traps designed to prevent attempts to escape from East Germany. The improved border defences succeeded in reducing the scale of unauthorised emigration <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1860 the Thorndon Park {{reservoir}} was opened, finally {{providing an}} alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the University of Adelaide {{was founded in}} 1874, the South Australian Art Gallery opened in 1881 and the Happy Valley Reservoir opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b> The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at Broken Hill provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the time}} of the year, the Waterfall Creek Falls range from <b>a</b> roaring {{waterfall}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gentle <b>trickle</b> falling down the cliffs.

25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} Europe in 1914 reduced European immigration to the United States <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle,</b> and the low wage labor supply that filled Northern factories contracted sharply. With U.S. entry into the War on April 16, 1917, the military draft depleted the labor pool even further. Lured by manufacturing jobs {{and the promise of}} a better life in the North, Blacks began a massive migration to Northern industrial centers, and by 1920 over 300,000 had relocated to Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland. The sudden exodus of their labor pool, and therefore their economic security, sent alarm throughout White communities in the South. Whites in the North reacted with similar consternation over the influx of Blacks into their cities. Southern White anger over increasing race assertiveness of Blacks, and Northern White concerns about Black migration, led to more virulent racism and frequent outbreaks of racial violence. After the War ended on November 11, 1918, the tense atmosphere exploded during the summer of 1919. On April 2, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, ushering a period of social, racial, and political turbulence.|$|E
25|$|Three {{times during}} the 6th century BC, the Jews (Hebrews) of the ancient Kingdom of Judah were exiled to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. These three {{separate}} occasions are mentioned in Jeremiah (52:28-30). The first exile was {{in the time of}} Jehoiachin in 597 BC, when the Temple of Jerusalem was partially despoiled and a number of the leading citizens exiled. After eleven years (in the reign of Zedekiah) a new Judean uprising took place; the city was razed to the ground, and a further exile ensued. Finally, five years later, Jeremiah records a third exile. After the overthrow of Babylonia by the Achaemenid Empire, Cyrus the Great gave the Jews permission to return to their native land (537 BC). According to the Hebrew Bible (See Jehoiakim; Ezra; Nehemiah and Jews) more than forty thousand are said to have availed themselves of the privilege, however this is not supported by modern scholarship. Lester Grabbe argues that the immigration would probably only have amounted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> over decades, with the archaeological record showing no evidence of large scale increases in population {{at any time during the}} Persian period. Cyrus also allowed them to practice their religion freely (See Cyrus Cylinder) unlike the previous Assyrian and Babylonian rulers.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, immigration from Ireland slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b> In addition, native born Irish-Argentines assimilated into the local community. The last time that hurling was played in Argentina was in 1980, when the Aer Lingus Hurling Club conducted a three-week tour of the country and played matches at several locations. Since 2009, with the realization of several Summers Camps and the visit of the All Stars in December, hurling returned to be a frequent activity at the Hurling Club, where many boys and young men have since been trained and taught to play. Even the Hurling Club are invited to participate Hurling Festival is organized within The Gathering events organized by Aer Lingus. This team will be present in September 2013 in the city of Galway. The team consists of 21 players from Hockey and Rugby teams. Many have contributed to the return of hurling as an activity in the Club. As an example we can name Alejandro Yoyo Wade, Johnny Wade, Barbie, Cecilia and Irene Scally, David Ganly, Dickie Mac Allister, Eduardo Cabrera Punter, Hernan Magrini Scally. Several Irish have participated in many opportunities to work with the skills and education: Jonathan Lynch, Kevin O'Connors and Michael Connery, who currently works with the team's training to participate in the Aer Lingus International Hurling Festival.|$|E
5000|$|But it couldn't last; {{the stream}} of mega-transports that once moved trillions of tons daily now only moved billions, and then millions, and finally slowed <b>to</b> almost <b>a</b> <b>trickle.</b> Deprived of their revenue stream, the tera-corporations {{expanded}} into the energy market.

25|$|This type of reactor {{contains}} {{a number of}} tubes with small diameter. These tubes contain catalyst and are surrounded by boiling water which removes the heat of reaction. A fixed-bed reactor is suitable for operation at low temperatures and has an upper temperature limit of 530nbsp&K. Excess temperature leads to carbon deposition and hence blockage of the reactor. Since large amounts of the products formed are in liquid state, this type of reactor can also be referred <b>to</b> as <b>a</b> <b>trickle</b> flow reactor system.|$|R
