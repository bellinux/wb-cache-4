5|$|The Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes in Delaware are {{numbered}} {{according to a}} national numbering pattern. Interstate Highways that run north–south have odd numbers, increasing from west to east, while those that run east–west have even numbers, increasing from south to north. Major north–south Interstates have numbers ending in 5 while major east–west Interstates have numbers ending in 0. Three-digit Interstates begin with odd numbers if they are a spur and an even number if they are a bypass or beltway and repeat numbers in different states. As such, the major north–south Interstate along the East Coast, Interstate 95 (I-95), passes through northern New Castle County. I-495 bypasses the section of I-95 <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city of Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.
