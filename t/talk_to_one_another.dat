5|$|Her cell was 6 × 12ft (1.8 x 3.6m) with no window, {{containing}} a bed, toilet and sink. The jail had 30 cells {{built in a}} U shape, and although detainees could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> {{they were unable to}} see each other. Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book. Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E
5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E
25|$|Chaozhou {{children}} {{are introduced to}} Standard Chinese as early as in kindergarten; however, Chaozhou remains the primary medium of instruction. In {{the early years of}} primary education, Mandarin becomes the sole language of instruction, although students typically continue to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in Chaozhou. Mandarin is widely understood, however minimally, by most younger Chaozhou speakers, but the elderly usually do not speak Mandarin since teaching was done in the local vernacular in the past.|$|E

Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kenichi Matsuyama, {{the actor}} who portrayed L, {{said that he and}} Fujiwara became [...] "so immersed" [...] in their {{character}} portrayals that they did not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> while on the set; when filming ceased they conversed and [...] "went out for a drink or two". Matsuyama also said that Light and L are [...] "extremely" [...] alike in that they have [...] "a very strong sense of justice".|$|E
2500|$|The {{friendship}} between Zappa and Van Vliet {{over the years}} was sometimes expressed {{in the form of}} rivalry as musicians drifted back and forth between their groups. Van Vliet embarked on the 1975 Bongo Fury tour with Zappa and the Mothers, mainly because conflicting contractual obligations made him unable to tour or record independently. Their relationship grew acrimonious on the tour {{to the point that they}} refused to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Zappa became irritated by Van Vliet, who drew constantly, including while on stage, filling one of his large sketch books with rapidly executed portraits and warped caricatures of Zappa. Musically, Van Vliet's primitive style contrasted sharply with Zappa's compositional discipline and abundant technique. Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black described the situation as [...] "two geniuses" [...] on [...] "ego trips".|$|E

60|$|We kept {{ourselves}} here incognito {{for a great}} while, {{passing for}} two Armenian merchants still, as we had done before; and by this time we had gotten {{so much of the}} Persian and Armenian jargon, which they talked at Bassorah and Bagdad, and everywhere that we came in the country, as was sufficient to make us able to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> {{so as not to be}} understood by anybody, though sometimes hardly by ourselves.|$|E

60|$|One day, {{soon after}} this, {{he came upon}} two men resting under a tree {{in the heat of}} the day. Being tired he {{stretched}} himself on the ground at no great distance from them, and soon they all three began to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> In the course of conversation, Bobino asked the two men where they were going; and they replied that they were on their way to a neighbouring town, where, that day, a new ruler was to be chosen by the people.|$|E
60|$|None {{about the}} fire {{attempted}} to salute me. Most of them disregarded me, ostentatiously. I looked round for the Hyena-swine, {{but he was}} not there. Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast Folk squatted, staring into the fire or <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R

6000|$|And {{the most}} genial, the most sociable too.

That dull reserve that seemed to hold the passengers in the electric suburban has clean vanished and gone. They are talking,--listen,--of the harvest, and the late election, and of how the local member is mentioned for the cabinet and all the old familiar topics of the sort. Already the conductor has changed his glazed hat for an ordinary round Christie {{and you can hear}} the passengers calling him and the brakesman [...] "Bill" [...] and [...] "Sam" [...] as if they were all one family.|$|E

But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye, why so much the better." ...|$|E
50|$|Cinema {{etiquette}} is the set {{of social}} norms observed by patrons of a movie theater.

The story of the meeting between your two rulers which you, Prince Korndoff, have alluded to as a fairy tale, was a {{perfectly}} true one. I have known of that meeting some time, and I have certain proof of what transpired at it. The North Sea incident was no chance affair. It was a deliberately and skilfully arranged casus belli, although your admiral, Prince Korndoff, had to go one hundred miles {{out of his way}} to find the Dogger Bank fishing-fleet. You spoke to me last night of Cherbourg, Prince. I think that after all your secret service is scarcely so successful as mine, for I can assure you that you will find there all that is to be found to-day at Kiel." ...|$|E

You see {{hundreds}} of plays every year. But to me, who have never seen anything of this kind before, the effect of this play is terribly disquieting. Sir: if it had been what people call an immoral play, I shouldnt have minded a bit. [Vaughan is shocked]. Love beautifies every romance and justifies every audacity. [Bannal assents gravely]. But there are reticences which everybody should respect. There are decencies too subtle to be put into words, without which human society would be unbearable. People could not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> as those people talk.

6000|$|... "Probably {{the weakest}} Piece I ever {{translated}}?" [...] exclaims one, who has translated several such. Nevertheless {{there is a}} straggle of pungent sense in it,--like the outskirts of lightning, seen in that dismally wet weather, which the Royal Party had. Its wit is very copious, but slashy, bantery, and proceeds mainly by exaggeration and turning topsy-turvy; a rather barren species of wit. Of humor, in the fine poetic sense, no vestige. But there is surprising veracity,--truthfulness unimpeachable, if you will read well. What promptitude, too;--what funds for conversation, when needed! This scraggy Piece, which {{is better than the}} things people often <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> was evidently written as fast as the pen could go.--"It is done, if such a Hand could have DONE it, in the manner of Bachaumont and La Chapelle," [...] says Voltaire scornfully, in that scandalous VIE PRIVEE;--of which phrase this is the commentary, if readers need one:-- ...|$|E
5000|$|A New York Times review, {{published}} {{ten days}} after the show premiered, describes what critic Caryn James thought was distinctive about the show: The idea of women <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> on daytime television is not exactly radical.

It actively defies the bubbleheads-'R'-us approach <b>to</b> women's <b>talk</b> shows.|$|R
