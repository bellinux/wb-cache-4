25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> so we bring down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E
500|$|Full albums {{were also}} made {{available}} as downloadable content; the remaining songs from Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Rubber Soul {{have since been}} released on the consoles' respective store services. While there is potential for the entire Beatles catalogue to be made available, this will be unlikely, according to John Drake of Harmonix. Drake identified the costly development process as a potentially prohibitive factor: [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> one song, it's not like Rock Band where {{we wait for the}} masters to come in and just author them... its like, send people to Abbey Road, use the original tape, separate them out... it costs thousands of dollars." [...] Drake asserted that Harmonix would take sales of the currently announced albums into consideration before continuing development of downloadable content. Harmonix's Foster stated that solo acts from the Beatles' members will not be included as downloadable content for The Beatles: Rock Band; however, he did not rule out the possibility of these acts appearing in other Rock Band games. A three pack of songs from Paul McCartney's 2009 live album, Good Evening New York City, was made available for the main Rock Band series on 5 January 2010. John Lennon's [...] "Imagine" [...] {{is a part of the}} Rock Band 3 soundtrack, with the full Imagine album arriving later as downloadable content in celebration of Lennon's 70th birthday. A pack featuring Paul McCartney's band Wings was also released as DLC for Rock Band 3 on 28 December 2010.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do.</b> I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E

2500|$|Consumer Reports {{considered}} these alleged {{associations between}} amalgam and chronic disease made by some health practitioners as [...] "prospecting for diseases". [...] The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) similarly has stated, [...] "There is no scientific evidence {{to connect the}} development or worsening of MS with dental fillings containing mercury, and therefore no reason to have those fillings removed. Although poisoning with heavy metals-such as mercury, lead, or manganese can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms such as tremor and weakness, the damage is inflicted {{in a different way}} than occurs in MS and the process is also different." [...] The Lupus Foundation of America also states on their website, [...] "At the present <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have any scientific data that indicates that dental fillings may act as a trigger of lupus. In fact, {{it is highly unlikely that}} dental fillings aggravate or cause SLE." ...|$|E

Spoke on ballot, and voted in 324-230 with mind satisfied, and as to feeling, a {{lingering}} reluctance.” How far this reluctance was due to misgivings on the merits of the ballot, how far to the doubts that haunt every ministerial leader as to the possibilities of parliamentary <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know. The bill, enlarged and reintroduced next year, was entrusted to the hands of Mr. Forster—himself, like Mr. Gladstone, a latish convert to the principle of secret voting—and by Forster’s persistent force and capacity for hard and heavy labour, after some eighteen days in committee, it passed through the House of Commons.|$|E

He had the big paper knife in his hand, and 'Mind, Dorcas,' he says, 'you'll {{have to be very}} respectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displeased with you!' Miss Cynthia, she was what they call an Apache, or some such name--a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked.

60|$|And now, my friends, what lesson may {{we learn}} from this? It is easy to say, We have not sinned as deeply as David, and {{therefore}} his story {{has nothing to do}} with us. My friends, whether we have sinned as deeply as David or not, his story has to do with you, and me, and every soul in this church, and every soul in the whole world, or it would not be in the Bible. For no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation; that is, it does not only point at one man here and another there: but those who wrote it were moved by the Holy Ghost, who lays down the eternal universal laws of holiness, of right and good, which are right and good for you, and me, and all mankind; and therefore David's story has to do with you and me every <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> wrong, and know that we have done wrong.|$|E

60|$|I {{was not in}} the Auld Licht {{church that}} day, but I heard of the sermon before night, and this, I think, is as good an {{opportunity}} as another for showing how the gossip about Gavin reached me up here in the Glen school-house. Since Margaret and her son came to the manse I had kept the vow made to myself and avoided Thrums. Only once had I ventured to the kirk, and then, instead of taking my old seat, the fourth from the pulpit, I sat down near the plate, where I could look at Margaret without her seeing me. To spare her that agony I even stole away as the last word of the benediction was pronounced, and my haste scandalised many, for with Auld Lichts it is not customary to retire quickly from the church after the manner of the godless U. P.'s (and the Free Kirk is little better), who have their hats in their hand when they rise for the benediction, so that they may at once pour out like a burst dam. We resume our seats, look straight before us, clear our throats and stretch out our hands for our womenfolk to put our hats into them. In <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> get out, but I am never sure how.|$|E

But the same King Edward was some time after so disgusted at the townsmen for officiously falling upon the French, after a truce was made and proclaimed, that he effectually disarmed them, took away their whole fleet, ships, tackle, apparel, and furniture; and since that <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not read of any of their naval exploits, nor that they ever recovered or attempted to recover their strength at sea.
