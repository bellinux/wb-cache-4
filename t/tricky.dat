5|$|Maxinquaye is the 1995 {{debut album}} by English rapper and {{producer}} <b>Tricky.</b> By {{the time he}} recorded the album, <b>Tricky</b> had grown frustrated with his limited role in the group Massive Attack and discovered vocalist Martina Topley-Bird, who he felt would offer another dimension to his lyrics. He signed a solo contract with 4th & B'way Records in 1993 and recorded Maxinquaye the following year primarily at his home studio in London with Topley-Bird as the album's predominant vocalist. Additional contributing singers included Alison Goldfrapp, Ragga, and Mark Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{produced}} by <b>Tricky</b> with assistance from Mark Saunders, who helped him utilize dub production techniques and heavily altered samples taken {{from a variety of}} musical sources. The record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae, and experimental music. The songs explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy, and recreational drug use. In writing them, <b>Tricky</b> drew on his experiences in the British drug culture and the influence of his deceased mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{released}} on 20 February 1995 and sold over 100,000 copies in its {{first few months of}} release in the UK, despite no significant radio airplay. The record charted for 35 weeks on the British albums chart, peaking at number three. After it {{was released}} in the US on April 18, <b>Tricky</b> toured the country as a supporting act for fellow English recording artist PJ Harvey. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold 222,000 copies in the US by 2003. By 2012, it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. That same year, <b>Tricky</b> performed the entire album with Topley-Bird on April 27 at the Sundance London festival, which was their first onstage appearance together in 15 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tricky's</b> ninth album Mixed Race was {{released}} on 27 September 2010 and the first single from the album became available on 23 August. The album includes contributions from Franky Riley, Terry Lynn, Bobby Gillespie, Hamadouche, Blackman and <b>Tricky's</b> youngest brother Marlon Thaws.|$|R

5|$|The {{musician}} <b>Tricky</b> was {{a member}} of the Wild Bunch sound system and a contributor to Massive Attack's first two albums. Born in 1968, <b>Tricky</b> grew up in Knowle West in the 1970s and 1980s and was educated at Merrywood School. He named his 2008 album Knowle West Boy in tribute to the area's influence on him and his music. Boxer Dixie Brown lived in Knowle West from the 1930s until the 1950s and was a regular at the Venture Inn, a public house in Melvin Square. He was frequently visited by black American troops during World War II. The Eagles were a rock and roll band who formed in the late 1950s at the Eagle House youth club and featured in the 1962 film Some People.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé {{credited}} {{both her}} husband, rapper Jay-Z, and jazz singer Etta James for inspiring her {{to push the}} limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, I Am... drew inspiration from folk and alternative rock, while blending acoustic guitar elements into contemporary ballads. The tracks on the first disc were written and produced by Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with Babyface, <b>Tricky</b> Stewart, The-Dream and Ryan Tedder. Sasha Fierce boasted production from Darkchild and Sean Garrett.|$|E
5|$|E=MC² is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It {{was released in}} the United States on April 15, 2008 by Island Records. The singer began recording the album in 2007 in Anguilla, after writing and composing most of its material during and after her 2006 Adventures of Mimi Tour. Carey worked with several notable songwriters and producers {{during the course of}} the project, including Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, The-Dream, <b>Tricky</b> Stewart, Scott Storch and Danja.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne viewed Angels with Dirty Faces as <b>Tricky's</b> best album since his 1995 debut Maxinquaye. He {{described it as}} an [...] "alluring sonic blur" [...] that preserved his previous music's mesmeric sounds yet felt [...] "more adventurous, rhythmically and musically, than its predecessors". Simon Price hailed it as <b>Tricky's</b> most cogent work since his debut album: [...] "Simultaneously challenging and gorgeously formed, it's a brilliant mix of defiance and achievement." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau {{said it was a}} rock album with a live band on every song, no samples, and [...] "grimy" [...] productions that complemented <b>Tricky's</b> anti-social themes, making for a difficult but interesting listen: ...|$|R
5|$|My World is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. It {{was released on}} 17 November 2009, by Island Records. The album is considered {{the first half of}} a two-piece project, later being supplemented by his debut studio album My World 2.0 (2010). After signing a recording contract in light of his growing popularity on YouTube, Bieber worked with collaborators including his mentor Usher, in addition to producers <b>Tricky</b> Stewart, The-Dream, and Midi Mafia. Its music incorporates pop and R styles, and lyrically discusses teen romance and coming of age situations.|$|E
5|$|Star Fox Adventures {{features}} {{both the}} established main {{characters of the}} Star Fox series—Fox, Falco Lombardi, Slippy Toad and Peppy Hare (though Falco is absent from {{the majority of the}} game), as well as a host of new characters, including a mysterious blue fox named Krystal and the small dinosaur Prince <b>Tricky.</b> The entire planet is populated with dinosaurs, like the tyrannical General Scales, and other prehistoric animals such as pterosaurs and mammoths.|$|E
5|$|Benny was a <b>tricky</b> {{one because}} he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really <b>tricky</b> because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a <b>tricky</b> shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} in 2005, Titan Quest received generally positive reviews when released, being both praised {{as a good}} example of the genre while at the same time being criticized for its traditional gameplay. Sales of the main game and its expansion have been estimated as approaching one million units. The mobile port was <b>tricky</b> for its developers due to adapting the game for touchscreen controls: like the console version, it received positive reviews upon release. The engine and gameplay of Titan Quest later became the foundation for Grim Dawn, a video game developed by team members from Iron Lore following the studio's closure. In 2016, an improved and expanded Anniversary Edition was released and received very positive reviews.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Ono {{produced}} her own off-Broadway musical entitled New York Rock, featuring Broadway {{renditions of}} her songs. In 1995, she released Rising, a collaboration {{with her son}} Sean and his then-band, Ima. Rising spawned a world tour that traveled through Europe, Japan, and the United States. The following year, she collaborated with various alternative rock musicians for an EP entitled Rising Mixes. Guest remixers of Rising material included Cibo Matto, Ween, <b>Tricky,</b> and Thurston Moore. In 1997, Rykodisc reissued all her solo albums on CD, from Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band through Starpeace. Ono and her engineer Rob Stevens personally remastered the audio, and various bonus tracks were added, including outtakes, demos, and live cuts.|$|E
5|$|MiG-3s were {{delivered}} to frontline fighter regiments {{beginning in the}} spring of 1941 and were a handful for pilots accustomed to the lower-performance and docile Polikarpov I-152 and I-153 biplanes and the Polikarpov I-16 monoplane. It remained <b>tricky</b> and demanding to fly even after the extensive improvements made over the MiG-1. Many fighter regiments had not kept pace in training pilots to handle the MiG and the rapid pace of deliveries resulted in many units having more MiGs than trained pilots during the German invasion. By 1 June 1941, 1,029 MIG-3s were on strength, but there were only 494 trained pilots.|$|E
5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly <b>tricky</b> to write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic view of the world which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E

5|$|Post is {{the second}} solo studio album by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk. The album was released in June 1995 through One Little Indian in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. Unlike her previous release Debut—which was almost entirely produced by Nellee Hooper—Post is characterised by more collaborative efforts, including production by Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member <b>Tricky.</b> Moreover, Björk co-produced every song on the album. Post received widespread critical acclaim from reviewers and was a commercial success, charting at number 2 in the United Kingdom and 32 in the United States. It was certified gold in New Zealand and Sweden, and platinum in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Telegram, a remix album of songs from Post, was released in 1996.|$|E

While Lad befriends the girl, Glure invites the Tremaynes {{to show the}} prize-winning Lad at his upcoming dog show. However, Glure is jealous of Lad's success and has rigged one event to have such specialized rules that he believes only his recently purchased high-priced, English-trained collie can win. During the competition, which involves directing the dogs through a <b>tricky</b> set of a maneuvers, Lad is able to complete the course, while Glure's champion does not recognize the hand signals Glure makes while holding a cigar.|$|E
