However, the route of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E

5|$|When the Glynneath bypass {{was built}} in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> be straightened, and reduced in width beyond that, to allow <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> be widened. Above Pentremalwed lock, the road was built over the canal bed, and all traces have gone. This road was {{superseded}} by the A465 dual carriageway when it opened in 1996, and has become the B4242 road.

The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a backlog of public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E
