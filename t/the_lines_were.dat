5|$|A {{number of}} former rail lines in Melbourne and {{regional}} Victoria have {{been converted into}} rail trails, for walking, cycling and horse riding. These make excellent tracks for beginners as <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> originally designed to avoid steep gradients. Most lines are still in public ownership. Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War the {{majority}} of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London {{was surrounded by a}} defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.|$|E

50|$|Passenger {{services}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>were</b> closed around 1990. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{one of two}} remaining east-west lines in Schleswig-Holstein. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> a possible detour route of military strategic importance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1891 in the Bosnian gauge of 760mm. From 1963 <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> realigned and rebuilt to Standard gauge. Parts of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>line</b> <b>were</b> flooded by <b>the</b> {{creation of the}} a number of Hydroelectric dams along the river. <b>The</b> standard gauge <b>line</b> <b>was</b> officially opened on 26 and 27 November 1966. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> electrified in 1969.|$|R
5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened Cullompton {{railway station}} when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. Around 1931 <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> widened to provide two passing loops {{and a new}} goods shed and waiting room were constructed. It closed to {{passengers}} on 5 October 1964, the site now being used for the M5 motorway Cullompton services. The nearest railway station is now Tiverton Parkway open by British Rail.|$|E
5|$|The SIRT {{discontinued}} passenger {{service on}} the North Shore Branch to Arlington and the South Beach Branch to Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter, while the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight. By 1955, the third rail on both of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> removed. On September 7, 1954, SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger {{service on the}} Tottenville Branch on October 7, 1954. A large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville Branch to continue.|$|E
5|$|The first {{crude oil}} arrived at Phoenixville via the Big Inch on August 14, 1943, {{and the first}} refined product in the Little Big Inch arrived on March 2, 1944. The Big Inch carried up to 334,456 barrels of crude oil a day, the Little Big Inch 239,844 barrels of gasoline; <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> among the largest {{industrial}} consumers of electricity in the US, requiring 3.89 million kilowatt {{hours a day to}} pump the oil along the pipes.|$|E

The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> operated as a rack railway, using the Abt system and with a maximum gradient of 15%. In total <b>the</b> <b>line</b> overcomes a height difference of 1062 m. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> electrified with an overhead supply at 1500 V DC.|$|R
50|$|After that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{only served}} by freight trains until <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{electrified}} {{as part of}} a wider scheme, and Theobalds Grove station reopened to passengers on 21 November 1960. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> now known as the Southbury Loop.|$|R
30|$|In this region, {{you have}} an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart next to an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together. When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together, <b>the</b> 3 D shape of the terrain is steep, and changes quickly (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES). When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart, <b>the</b> shape of the terrain is shallow, and changes slowly (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES).|$|R
5|$|Work on Valperga's {{modifications}} to the lines progressed slowly, and {{by the beginning of}} the 18th century the outworks, glacis and enceinte facing Marsamxett were still unfinished. Works continued under a number of other engineers, including Charles François de Mondion, and <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> largely complete when Porte des Bombes was constructed in 1721. Further alterations were made over the following decades, such as the construction of the Northern Entrenchment in the 1730s.|$|E
5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E
5|$|Although {{situated}} in an unpopulated area, Wotton station was relatively well used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any {{station on the}} line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> not connected, a station (also named Wotton) {{was built on the}} new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a stationmaster.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 50.2 km {{long with}} 8 stations, from Pinghu, {{where it is}} linked to Guangshen railway, to Shekou West or Mawan (which are on {{different}} branches). <b>The</b> entire <b>line</b> <b>is</b> single-track and built at [...] The maximum speed on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 75 km/h. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> not electrified, and therefore only diesel locomotives <b>are</b> used on <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Adelaide network, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> broad gauge. Dual gauge {{sleepers}} have been laid to allow for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to <b>be</b> converted to standard gauge at a future date. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 35.9 kilometres long and is the second longest of the Adelaide suburban railway <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> double track throughout.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North Eastern Railway became the North Eastern area of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The {{passenger}} service was withdrawn north of Tow Law on 1 May 1939. Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> placed under the control of British Railways. In the early 1950s control was split between the North Eastern and London Midland regions with Kirkby Stephen as the boundary. Local passenger trains were withdrawn between Kirkby Stephen and Tebay on 1 December 1952. The service along Weardale was withdrawn on 29 June 1953 and services north of Crook on 11 June 1956.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|In April 1901, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{announced}} track {{depression and}} raising throughout {{portions of the}} line through Newark and the Oranges. Although the depression went into Newark, most {{of the debate over}} localities of stations was basically into the Oranges. In 1903, the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station, and <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> depressed through Roseville. The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station {{in the middle of the}} five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with a brand new street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} lifted after closure, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{in need of}} {{a complete}} rebuild.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{single track}} from Woodville to Grange with no passing loops over its entire length. All {{stations}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>are</b> unattended and have only very basic passenger waiting facilities. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 5.5 kilometres long and broad gauge (1600mm).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1897, and was {{initially}} operated as a water counterbalance funicular. In 1969, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> automated, {{still as a}} water counterbalance funicular. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and converted to electric operation, with new cabins and stations.|$|R
5|$|Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in Rob Reiner's 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap. Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest {{received}} {{a deal to}} write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of {{what they wanted to}} do. It was eventually greenlighted by Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio at Embassy Pictures. The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and heavy metal bands, as well as the hagiographic tendencies of rockumentaries of the time. The three core members of the band Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> ad-libbed. It was filmed in 25 days.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{knocked out}} power and {{telephone}} lines across the eastern {{region of the}} country, leaving thousands isolated until <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> repaired hours later. The cyclone caused extensive damage along the coastline, including {{in the city of}} Sur and the village of Ras al Hadd at the easternmost point of the Omani mainland. In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages to keep people away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported to the oil fields of the nation. The liquefied natural gas terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing. Around 20,000people were affected, and damage in the country was estimated at around $4.2billion (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling {{stock in the}} world, {{in part due to}} the network having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a few}} UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro Cammell cars. However, as <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This {{is the result of}} the region’s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E
