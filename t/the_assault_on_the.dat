5|$|Chase was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen to lead <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted the temptation to swiftly overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison.|$|E
5|$|He {{adopted a}} plan to capture a hill where republican guns could {{dominate}} the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. <b>The</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte {{was wounded in the}} thigh. He was promoted to brigadier general at the age of 24. Catching the attention of the Committee of Public Safety, he was put in charge of the artillery of France's Army of Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{elements}} {{drawn from}} the 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division, that were {{to take part in}} the attack on Fort Eben-Emael, were named Sturmabteilung Koch (Assault Detachment Koch); named after the commanding officer of the group, Hauptmann Walter Koch. The force was assembled in November 1939. It was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division, as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots. The Luftwaffe allocated 1,815 combat, 487 transport aircraft and 50 gliders for <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Low Countries.|$|E
5|$|A {{battalion}} of the 3rd Parachute Division, {{along with an}} armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division, now joined <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge. At 14:00 the 8th Infantry Battalion on the ridge's northern slopes once more came under attack. Although the infantry and armour {{closing in on the}} Polish positions were eventually repulsed, with a large number of prisoners being taken and artillery again causing significant casualties, the Poles were being gradually pushed back. However, they managed to retain their grip on Point 262N and with well-coordinated artillery fire continued to exact a toll on German units traversing the corridor. Another attempt was made to organise an attack towards Point 239 but the Germans were ready and the 9th Infantry Battalion's 3rd Company was driven back with heavy losses.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls, {{and at the}} windows, {{were far}} less obstinate {{than those in the}} {{previous}} attack, as they were intended only as diversions to <b>the</b> main <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> posterns and gate; and when the assailants at these points fell back, the storming parties also retreated.

5|$|Meanwhile, the outpost on {{the left}} around the Isurava {{ridgeline}} held on throughout 27 August, but as the Japanese began bypassing the position, the order was given to withdraw across the ridgeline to the west. After this, frontal attacks against the dug-in defenders in the main defensive position began, representing the start {{of what would be}} four days of violent attacks. The attack was supported by a mountain gun and mortars that had been manhandled up the track. As the first wave fell on the position, the Australians sought to conceal their positions as best they could, firing as late as possible. Humidity and physical exertion sapped the strength of the attacking Japanese and the initial assault was held. That night, as heavy rain fell, <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 39th around Isurava resumed, with a force penetrating the Australian positions around the abandoned garden.|$|E
5|$|Orders {{were issued}} for the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades to advance at 06:00 on 25 September to capture Amman {{followed}} by the 1st Light Horse Brigade who left at 06:30. They were to strongly assault the defenders, if the town was lightly held. If Amman {{was found to be}} held in strength <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town was to be deferred until infantry could reinforce the mounted infantry. Only the outlying or forward trenches were to be attacked, artillery was to fire on the town, all lines of retreat northwards were to be cut. Aerial bombing of Amman was requested. The 1st Battalion British West Indies Regiment arrived at Suweileh at 07:00 to take over garrison duties from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Elephant Point was an {{airborne}} operation {{conducted by a}} composite Gurkha airborne battalion that took place on 1 May 1945. In March 1945, plans were made for an assault on Rangoon, the capital of Burma, as a stepping-stone {{on the way to}} recapturing Malaya and Singapore. Initial plans for <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city had called for a purely land-based approach by British Fourteenth Army, but concerns about heavy Japanese resistance led to this being modified {{with the addition of a}} joint amphibious-airborne assault. This assault, led by 26th Indian Division, would sail up the Rangoon River, but before it could do so, the river would have to be cleared of Japanese and British mines. In order to achieve this, coastal defences along the river would have to be neutralized, including a battery at Elephant Point.|$|E

5|$|The British {{official}} casualty {{return for}} the siege listed 156 killed, 326 wounded and 70 missing. Cornwallis surrendered 7,087 officers and enlisted men in Yorktown when he capitulated and a further 840 sailors from the British fleet in the York River. Another 84 prisoners had been taken during <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> redoubts on October 16. Since only 70 men were reported as missing, this would suggest that 14 of the men officially marked down as ‘killed’ had in fact been captured. This gives {{a grand total of}} 142 killed, 326 wounded prisoners and 7,685 other prisoners. Jerome A. Greene mentions a German account that gives much higher figures: 309 killed and 595 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian II Corps—commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—initially {{assigned}} two infantry {{divisions and}} one armoured brigade to <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German positions around Verrières. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division—having taken heavy casualties {{during the first}} six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role. The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade. Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps: the 51st (Highland) Division, the Guards Armoured Division, and the British 7th Armoured Division. Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his {{plan of attack}} against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished to use his squadron's frigates in <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city, the seas were too rough to ensure their safety close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions {{under the command of}} Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and the third group of boats would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E

5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot {{on his way to}} work (this proved {{impossible}} as the Afghans had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E
5|$|Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan {{had ordered}} Burnside to make Roanoke Island his first target. Capture {{of the island}} would allow control of both Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, opening up a {{possible}} southern invasion route to Richmond. Coordinating with a naval flotilla commanded by Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Burnside launched an amphibious assault (one {{of the first of}} the Civil War) resulting in the Battle of Roanoke Island on February 7 and 8, 1862. After landing, the 21st spent a cold, wet night on picket duty. On February 8, it joined in <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Confederate fort {{at the center of the}} island. Moving through swamps and knee-deep water, Reno's brigade, including the 21st, advanced around the Union left flank on the west side of the fort. After firing steadily on the fort for some time and taking moderate casualties, the 21st was ordered by Brig. Gen. Reno to storm the fort. According to the regimental historian, the 21st Massachusetts was the first regiment to mount the earthworks of the fort; however, the honor was also claimed by the 9th New York. The Union forces were victorious in capturing the Confederate fort on Roanoke Island and took approximately 2,500 Confederate soldiers prisoner. The 21st suffered 13 killed and 44 wounded, or eight percent casualties, during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Syrian {{aircraft}} bombed the Israeli village Kinneret {{and the regional}} school Beit Yerah, on the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. By evening, Samakh (Tzemah) had fallen and a new Israeli defensive line {{was set up in}} the Deganias, facing the Syrian counterparts. At night, a Palmach company from Yiftach's 3rd Battalion attempted to recapture Samakh's police station. They stealthily reached the school next to the station, but <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual fort was warded off. On the morning of May 19, a message was sent from Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada that they were preparing for an evacuation, although when the order was given to stay put, the villages had already been abandoned, mostly to Afikim. In the morning, when the villagers carried out an order to return to their positions, local Arabs were already present at the location. The Syrian troops then captured the villages without a fight, and proceeded to loot and destroy them. Aharon Israeli wrote that an order was given not to disclose the flight of Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan's residents, but this became clear as fire and smoke rose from the villages, and hurt the morale of the Israelis making defensive preparations in the Deganias.|$|E

5|$|Predator {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{flew over}} Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa on 8 and 9 July, capturing {{images of the}} deployment of people inside. Security forces had the images taken to study the claims of Ghazi Abdul Rashid regarding casualties and damage caused to Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa. The UAVs flew over Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa {{for more than an}} hour, from 2:40 to 4:00am. Senior government officials and the Security Forces personnel examined the pictures and relayed the information directly to the command post on the ground. The UAV was given to Pakistan by the United States for use in the War on Terror. Strategic planning for <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mosque was conducted based on information gathered by the drone. Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E
5|$|Staff {{losses were}} significant. Frederick lost eight regimental colonels. Of his senior command, Seydlitz was wounded {{and had to}} {{relinquish}} command to Platen, nowhere near his equal in energy and nerve; Wedel was wounded so badly that he never fought again; Georg Ludwig von Puttkamer, commander of the Puttkamer Hussars, lay among the dead. Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, later the inspector general and major general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, was wounded at the battle. Ewald Christian von Kleist, the famous poet of the Prussian army, was badly injured in the latter moments of <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Walkeberge. By {{the time he was}} injured, Major Kleist was the highest-ranking officer in his regiment. Generalleutnant August Friedrich von Itzenplitz died of his wounds on 5 September, Prince Charles Anton August von Holstein-Beck on 12 September, and Finck's brigade commander, Generalmajor George Ernst von Klitzing, on 28 October in Stettin. Prussia was at its last gasp and Frederick despaired of preserving much of his remaining kingdom for his heir.|$|E
5|$|The German Armed Forces {{pioneered the}} use of {{large-scale}} airborne formations, first during the invasion of Norway and Denmark and later that year during the assaults on the Netherlands and Belgium in 1940 {{and later in the}} Battle of Crete in 1941. The Allied governments were aware of the success of these operations (but not of the heavy German casualties incurred, particularly during <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands and the invasion of Crete) and decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of five American and two British airborne divisions, as well as many smaller units. The 17th Airborne Division was activated on 15 April 1943 at Camp Mackall in North Carolina, under the command of the newly promoted Major General William Miley. The division was originally composed of the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, activated on 11 January 1943 at Fort Benning, the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment, and the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment. The official dedication ceremony for the unit took place on 1 May 1943, with thousands of civilian and military spectators, including Major General Eldridge G. Chapman, overall commander of Airborne Command and of all American airborne forces during World War II.|$|E
