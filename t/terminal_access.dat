5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International <b>terminal</b> <b>access</b> was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E
