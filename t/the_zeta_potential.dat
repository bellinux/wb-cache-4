40|$|Runoff from {{beef cattle}} feedlots is {{one source of}} {{potential}} water pollution. Two alternatives are available to prevent feedlot runoff from polluting streams; the water can be spread on agricultural land as irrigation water, {{or it can be}} treated before it is released to <b>the</b> streams. <b>Zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> on colloidal solids in feedlot water samples were investigated as one method of treatment control. To study the problem in the laboratory, samples of the feedlot surface material were obtained. The samples were mixed and frozen until used. All determinations were made using commercially available equipment in a temperature controlled room held at 70 ˚ F ± 1 ˚ F. A statistical model was developed to define quadratic equations for three variables. Multiple regression analyses resulted in three quadratic equations to define three separate relationships. <b>Zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> were found to average - 29. 5 millivolts on untreated samples. The potentials varied with pH and solids concentration according to theory. Two different chemical treatments were tested to control <b>the</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> on <b>the</b> colloids. Alum effectively reduced <b>the</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials.</b> <b>The</b> dosage required was high, and depended on solids concentration. As the solids concentration was reduced, lower dosages could be used to obtain similar charge reductions. One organic polyelectrolyte was tested. It was more effective than alum in reducing the charges. The dosage of polyelectrolyte required depended on solids concentration as alum did. The more important conclusions deduced from this study of suspended solids from a beef cattle feedlot surface were: 1) <b>The</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of <b>the</b> solids were negative and varied with pH and sample dilutions. 2) Particle <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> could be controlled by chemical treatments. 3) High chemical dosages were required to reduce <b>the</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> to near <b>the</b> isoelectric point. 4) Quadratic equations could be written to accurately define <b>the</b> relationships between <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials,</b> solids concentrations, and pH; and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials,</b> chemical dosages, and solids concentrations.

Eight resins were pulverized into powders (300 - 1000 nm). All experiments were conducted in 10 mM sodium chloride solution (pH 6. 5). BSA was dissolved in 10 mM NaCl with a concentration of 2. 0 × 10 - 5 mol/l. An adsorption assay was performed for one hour at 37 °C under continuous rotation (6 rpm). <b>The</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of both resins and BSA were negative, with BSA itself less negative than the resins themselves as an absolute value (p < 0. 0001). <b>The</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of seven resin surfaces after BSA adsorption were significantly less negative than were those of the resins without BSA adsorption (p < 0. 0001). Eight resins were divided into two classes based on the size of the surface potential difference between each resin and the BSA. The difference in surface potential between the resins and the BSA were small, leading to the theory that particles with identical charges repulse each other, and the amounts of adsorbed BSA on these resins might be less. On the other, when the differences between the other resins and BSA are large, so that the repulsive force between two nonidentical particles becomes zero and an attractive force might be generated, then more BSA might be adsorbed on those resins. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> were affected by BSA adsorption and became less negative.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potential</b> {{is a key}} {{indicator}} of the stability of colloidal dispersions. The magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>zeta</b> <b>potential</b> indicates the degree of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent, similarly charged particles in a dispersion. For molecules and particles that are small enough, a high zeta potential will confer stability, i.e., the solution or dispersion will resist aggregation. When the potential is small, attractive forces may exceed this repulsion and the dispersion may break and flocculate. So, colloids with high zeta potential (negative or positive) are electrically stabilized while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate as outlined in the table.|$|E
