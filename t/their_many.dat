5|$|Although Quatermass 2 was financially successful, its {{box office}} {{performance}} was eclipsed by the massive success of another Hammer film, The Curse of Frankenstein, {{which was to}} be the first of <b>their</b> <b>many</b> Gothic horror films. As a result it would be ten years before Hammer adapted the next Quatermass serial for the cinema with Quatermass and the Pit in 1967. Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions.|$|E
5|$|Analogue {{filters are}} a basic {{building}} block of signal processing much used in electronics. Amongst <b>their</b> <b>many</b> applications are the separation of an audio signal before application to bass, mid-range and tweeter loudspeakers; the combining and later separation of multiple telephone conversations onto a single channel; {{the selection of a}} chosen radio station in a radio receiver and rejection of others.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in <b>their</b> <b>many</b> habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E

5|$|Composite bows {{can be used}} without {{difficulty}} by infantry. The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in <b>their</b> <b>many</b> engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of {{the forces of the}} Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they lost most of these troops and never replaced them.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown {{has many}} {{additional}} groups representing national, ethnic, and linguistic interests. Georgetown's has {{the second most}} politically active student body in the United States according to the Princeton Review. Groups based on local, national, and international issues are popular, and political speech is protected on campus. Student political organizations are active on campus and engage <b>their</b> <b>many</b> members in local and national politics. The Georgetown University College Republicans represent their party, while the Georgetown University College Democrats, the largest student organization on campus in 2008, represent theirs.|$|E
5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To <b>their</b> <b>many</b> supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

He then writes about the preservation of the Union, the core of American nationhood, and which, along with the Constitution binds all Americans together and provides for the popular well being. Concerned about the obstacles and potential hazards that lay ahead for the nation, Washington urges the nation's people to cherish and safeguard their hard-won system of republican government despite <b>their</b> <b>many</b> differences.|$|E
5|$|Z. Marcas is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first {{published}} in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes {{the rise and fall}} of a brilliant political strategist who is abandoned by the politicians he helps into power.

The story follows <b>their</b> <b>many</b> discussions about the political situation in France.|$|E

5|$|In 2092, {{humanity}} has conquered mortality {{through the}} endless renewal of cells. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. Curious {{to know of}} life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into <b>their</b> <b>many</b> possible outcomes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army, a third force, not all that much smaller than either, would operate on Dutch soil: the French 7th Army. It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy, and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory. The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of <b>their</b> <b>many</b> waterways. However, both the French and the Germans saw {{the possibility of a}} surprise flanking attack in this region. For the Germans this would have the advantage of bypassing the Antwerp-Namur line. The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical, as they are just opposite the Thames estuary, so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England.|$|E
5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite <b>their</b> <b>many</b> shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite <b>their</b> <b>many</b> political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{game in the}} series, renamed Dragon Warrior outside Japan, {{was released}} in 1986 in Japan and 1989 in North America. Dragon Quest games are released in Japan and, until 2004's , were later localized for the North American market under the Dragon Warrior title. That game {{was also the first}} main series game to be released outside Japan and North America. In addition to the 10games released as part of the main (numbered) series and <b>their</b> <b>many</b> spin-offs and related titles, the Dragon Quest series has spawned many works in other media including anime, movies, novels and manga, and radio dramas. Many games, particularly the main series, have soundtrack album releases featuring their music in different arrangements. Square Enix has also consistently released companion books for its games, which provide additional backstory and plot information, as well as detailed walkthroughs. The majority of the games and media related to the series have only been released in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of circumcision {{is thought to}} have been brought to the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa by either the Jews after one of <b>their</b> <b>many</b> expulsions from European countries, or by Muslim Moors escaping after the 1492 conquest of Spain. In {{the second half of the}} 1st millennium CE, inhabitants from the North East of Africa moved south and encountered groups from Arabia, the Middle East, and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what is known today as the Bantu. Bantu tribes were observed to be upholding what was described as Jewish law, including circumcision, in the 16th century. Circumcision and elements of Jewish dietary restrictions are still found among Bantu tribes.|$|E
