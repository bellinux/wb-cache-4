5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many ways a medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was densely populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E

After the start of the civil war, the market was controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials.

5|$|Downtown San Diego {{is located}} on San Diego Bay. Balboa Park {{encompasses}} several mesas and canyons to the northeast, surrounded by older, dense urban communities including Hillcrest and North Park. To the east and southeast lie City Heights, the College Area, and Southeast San Diego. To the north lies Mission Valley and Interstate 8. The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights occupy {{the northwest corner of}} the city. To their south are Torrey Pines State Reserve and the business center of the Golden Triangle. Further south are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego, such as San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico–United States border, and are physically separated from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> by the cities of National City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congregation Beth Israel {{experienced}} decline {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and state's Jewish community. The Jewish population in Mississippi peaked in 1927 at 6,420 {{and has since}} decreased steadily. By 2001, only 1,500 Jews remained in the state. Children of the original Jewish immigrants – mostly merchants – {{were more interested in}} going to college to become professionals than taking over family businesses. The rise of national retail chains pressured many Jews to move to larger cities, leaving empty storefronts to line streets of smaller cities that were once economic centers. As of 2006, there were thirteen Jewish congregations left in the state, and only two still had a full-time rabbi. Meridian as a whole has also seen a decline in population. Between the censuses in 1980 and 2000, the city's population declined over 16% from 46,577 to 39,968.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In {{the local newspaper}} Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether {{there should be a}} ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg {{was meant to be a}} station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the New York City Department of City Planning {{projected}} that Manhattan's population will increase by 289,000 people between 2000 and 2030, {{an increase of}} 18.8% over the period, second only to Staten Island, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> is projected to grow by 12.7% over the same period. The school-age population was expected to grow 4.4% by 2030, {{in contrast to a}} small decline in the city as a whole. The elderly population was forecast to grow by 57.9%, with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% growth citywide. However, these 2006 projections may have become outdated, as Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001. The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 , nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census. The southern tip of Manhattan became the fastest growing part of New York City between 1990 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E

The German troops in this area were exhausted and demoralized from the fighting against the FFI, so Taskforce Butler was also able to advance at high speed. Digne was liberated on 18August. At Grenoble, the 157th Reserve Infantry Division faced the Allied advance, and its commander decided to retreat on 21August toward the Alps. This decision {{would prove to be}} fatal for the Germans, as it left a large gap in the eastern flank of the retreating Army GroupG. Blaskowitz now decided to sacrifice the 242nd Infantry Division in Toulon, as well as the 244th Infantry Division in Marseille, to buy time for the rest of Army GroupG to retreat through the Rhône Valley, while the 11th Panzer Division and the 198th Infantry Division would shield the retreat in several defense lines.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{also joined}} the freeway at Cascade Road headed east, and {{together}} I-96/US16/M-50 continued through eastern Kent County. M-50 departed {{to the south}} near Lowell, and the freeway crossed into southern Ionia County. Passing south of Portland, the freeway crossed east into Clinton County. North of Grand Ledge, I-96 ended and US16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the Capital City Airport and east to Larch Street, where US16 turned south along US27 north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US16 turned east on the one-way street, while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue.

5|$|The citadel {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the citadel of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level as <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra. The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the citadel. The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the citadel. The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the citadel. Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E
