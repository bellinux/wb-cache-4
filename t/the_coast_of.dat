5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed {{east of the}} Bahamas on September6.

On September 13 the cyclone made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, but then quickly weakened to a {{tropical storm}} and turned eastward into the Atlantic on September14. Throughout September15, whilst over water, the storm regained hurricane strength and continued northward before becoming extratropical in the mid-Atlantic on September17.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Africa on August 24. It developed {{into an area}} of low pressure as it crossed the Atlantic, and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960mi (1550km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first {{showed signs of}} development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection {{in conjunction with a}} well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Africa on August 31, 2006. It moved westward without development, {{and entered the}} eastern Pacific Ocean on September 10. An area of convection developed along the wave axis, several hundred {{miles south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. Convection and banding features organized around a developing center, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 13. The system continued to organize and strengthened into Tropical Storm Lane early on September 14 about 90miles (145km) off <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. Based on a potentially developing anticyclone over the storm and a track over warm water temperatures, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model issued a 46percent probability for rapid intensification of the storm.|$|E
