25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they are comfortable with their own genitals, or because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E

50|$|The third {{tendency}} in the League consisted of Luke Tripp and John Williams, who walked a middle road between {{the other two}} schools of thought. Tripp and Williams <b>were</b> primarily <b>concerned</b> with developing the political consciousness of both League supporters outside of the plant and workers that {{were involved in the}} RUMs inside the plants. Additionally, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> either of the other two tendencies becoming too ambitious without first laying the groundwork for what they viewed as key to developing a revolutionary workers movement supported by the community. Primarily, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> other League leadersâ€™ ideas about spreading the League to other cities without first perfecting the organization in Detroit, and viewed smaller, social political meetings with workers, students and community members as key to developing a revolutionary working class movement.|$|R

60|$|For instance, {{the critic}} {{generally}} begins by dismissing these {{conflicts with the}} statement that they are all about small points of theology. I do not admit that theological points are small points. Theology is only thought applied to religion; and those who prefer a thoughtless religion need not be so very disdainful of others with a more rationalistic taste. The old joke that the Greek sects only differed about a single letter is about the lamest and most illogical joke in the world. An atheist and a theist only differ by a single letter; yet theologians are so subtle as to distinguish definitely between the two. But though I do not in any case allow that it is idle to be concerned about theology, as a matter of actual fact these quarrels are not chiefly concerned about theology. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> history. They are concerned with the things about which the only human sort of history is concerned; great memories of great men, great battles for great ideas, the love of brave people for beautiful places, and the faith by which the dead are alive. It is quite true that with this historic sense men inherit heavy responsibilities and revenges, fury and sorrow and shame. It is also true that without it men die, and nobody even digs their graves.|$|E
