5|$|By the mid-1930s, Barrowclough was {{disenchanted with}} the state of New Zealand's {{military}} forces, which was in decline {{due to a lack of}} resources and the discontinuation of compulsory military training.

5|$|Sometime {{after the}} {{translation}} of the relics of Oswald of Northumbria to Bardney Abbey by Osthryth between 675 and 679, Wilfrid, along with Hexham Abbey, began <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>and</b> promote {{the cult of the}} dead king. Barbara Yorke sees this advocacy as {{a major factor in the}} prominence given to Oswald in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. Historian D. P. Kirby regards Wilfrid's championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid's expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald's branch of the Northumbrian royal family over his own. One of Wilfrid's protégés, Willibrord, became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid's example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid's followers.|$|E
5|$|The seafront and {{the iconic}} cliff at Beachy Head {{has been used}} for many scenes in feature films, and the local council set up a film liaison unit <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>and</b> {{facilitate}} the shooting of film sequences in and around the town. The 2006 Academy Award-nominated film Notes on a Scandal includes scenes filmed at Beachy Head, Cavendish Hotel and 117Royal Parade. Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters were used as backdrops for scenes from the Quidditch World Cup in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Scenes from Half a Sixpence (1969) were filmed on the pier and near to the bandstand. The seafront area was also used for the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging directed by Gurinder Chadha. The Langham Hotel was a filming location for Made in Dagenham, which also featured the seafront and pier. A sequence of a rainy day at the seaside for the Doel family has as its backdrop the Wish Tower, the bandstand, the Cavendish Hotel and the pier in the 1987 British/American drama film 84 Charing Cross Road directed by David Jones.|$|E
