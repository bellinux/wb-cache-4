She was the largest warship built between 1868–75 out of the 19 vessels planned. The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen but led by staff from Western nations, who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden-hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by <b>those</b> <b>nations.</b> Chinese officials would later blame the French, in particular Prosper Giquel, for purposely providing them with out-of-date equipment and designs.|$|E

5|$|Jamaica {{is a large}} {{island with}} {{approximately}} 2.8 million residents that lies in the northern Caribbean Sea. Lying {{to the south of}} Cuba and to the southwest of the countries on Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), the island was originally colonized by the Spanish Empire until the British seized control of the island in 1655. Jamaica first competed as a British colony at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England, and competed at the next two Summer Olympics under the same auspices of the British Empire. The colony joined Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados in 1958 to form the West Indies Federation, competing jointly with <b>those</b> <b>nations</b> at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Jamaica later withdrew from the West Indies Federation, declaring complete independence from Great Britain in 1962, And participated as an independent nation {{for the first time at}} the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Between 1964 and 2008, the Caribbean nation sent delegations to all twelve Summer Olympic games, in addition to five Winter Olympic games.|$|E
5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in <b>those</b> <b>nations</b> which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Second Congress of the Communist International {{opened in}} Petrograd's Smolny Institute in July 1920, {{representing}} {{the last time}} that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow. There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead encouraging <b>those</b> <b>nations</b> under colonial occupation to transform their pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones. For this conference, he authored , a short book articulating his criticism of elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause. The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland, and was relocated to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August. Lenin's predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian communist government was overthrown and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Varying {{definitions}} of the term First World and {{the uncertainty of the}} term in today's world leads to different indicators of First World status. In 1945, the United Nations used the terms first, second, third, and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations (although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later). There are some references towards culture in the definition. They were defined in terms of Gross National Product (GNP), measured in U.S. dollars, along with other socio-political factors. The first world included the large industrialized, democratic (free elections, etc.) nations. The second world included modern, wealthy, industrialized nations, but they were all under communist control. Most {{of the rest of the}} world was deemed part of the third world, while the fourth world was considered to be <b>those</b> <b>nations</b> whose people were living on less than US$100 annually. If we use the term to mean high-income industrialized economies, then the World Bank classifies countries according to their GNI or gross national income per capita. The World Bank separates countries into four categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. The First World is considered to be countries with high-income economies. The high-income economies are equated to mean developed and industrialized countries.|$|E
