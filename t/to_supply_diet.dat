Despite this advantage, they do not always perform as well as diploids when fed commercial diets. This study investigated whether differences in dietary energy utilization might explain this reduced performance. Dietary lipid levels were adjusted <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>diets</b> with 22. 7, 23. 6 or 24. 4 MJ kg- 1 gross energy and fed to juvenile diploid and triploid brook charr. Fish were fed to satiation twice daily in a 70 -day growth trial, with samples collected at days 0 and 70 for proximate composition and plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) analysis. This {{was followed by a}} digestibility trial using the same diets to determine apparent digestibility coefficients. Triploids had lower growth rates and condition factor than diploids on all three diets, but there was no effect of ploidy on feed conversion efficiency. Triploids also had lower whole-body lipid content, but equal protein content, which resulted in lower energy content at both days 0 and 70. There was no effect of diet or ploidy on plasma IGF-I concentrations. Triploidy did not affect diet digestibility, suggesting that the reduced performance of triploids is due to a difference in metabolism and energy utilization. 9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|Under {{the present}} unusual conditions, {{when it is}} {{desirable}} to save staple foods and {{to reduce the amount}} of labor expended in transporting foods, special attention should be given to the possibility of using perishable food materials, particularly vegetables and fruits, near the place of their production. The purpose of this bulletin is to show how the use of these foods can be increased without lessening the food value or attractiveness of the diet or seriously altering food habits. In general, the bulletin points out that peas, beans, and similar legumes would be the most useful as protein (meat) savers; potatoes, sweet potatoes, and similar vegetables as starch savers; and fruits and sweet potatoes as possible sugar savers, while all fruits and green and succulent vegetables are valuable <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> the <b>diet</b> with mineral substances and with certain substances essential to health which are present in them and in many other foods in minute amounts. When vegetables are used <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> protein it is important to supplement them with some other food containing protein, and for this purpose milk, particularly skim milk (so often a by-product, and a perishable one as well), is important.

40|$|Protein is an {{essential}} nutrient for birds that represents {{a large share of}} the cost of diet for-mulations and has a direct influence on per-formance characteristics. The advances in the knowledge of the protein metabolism and the advent of new synthetic amino acids, with large-scale commercial production and at compatible prices, have allowed nutritionists to formulate diets closer to the bird requirements. Another advantage of using synthetic amino acids is the possibility of establishing an ideal ratio between all dietary amino acids by the concept of ideal protein, which contributes to the reduction of the dietary protein levels [1]. In order for the protein to be synthesized, all essential amino acids must be present in the diet in adequate amounts.

He is known to have tried using the Hansen Writing Ball, a contemporary typewriter device.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} a {{food security}} synthesis: that food insecurity traces to poverty, that pov-erty {{must be addressed}} by conomic development, and that economic development flows from application ofthe standard model that is now mainstream conomics. Food-insecure countries do not follow the standard model; their policies for agriculture and other sectors deter devel-opment. Reasons lie in institutions such as government and i attitudes. The economics offood security is straightforward. The chaUenge of food security for our time is for economists to work with others regarding socioinstitutional changes essential for proven policies and prac-rices <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> adequate <b>diets.</b> I n his classic Transforming Traditional Agriculture, Nobel Laureate T. W. Schultz (1964) held that food producers in traditional societies are efficient. The thesis {{of this article is}} that in the thirty-five years since publication of Schultz's book, a standard model of economic policy has become widely accepted by mainstream economics. That model has emerged asa proven performer in raising incomes and food secu ¡ Because of its importance, the first objective of this artide is to outline the standard model. A theme is that food security depends on overall policies and econornic development, not just on agricultural development. If farmers are as efficient in responding to incentives as Schultz contends, and if a workable standard economic model is available to raise living standards as this artide contends, why do more than 800 million people globally remain food in-secure? A second objective {{of this article is to}} initiate a dialogue on that question. This article outlines the basic economic frarnework to alleviate food insecurity. Cultural and institutional factors are touched on herein, but are addressed in more detail in subsequent articles by Robert Paarlberg andJoseph Molnar.

40|$|Provision of {{food is a}} {{prerequisite}} for the functioning of human society. Cropland where food and feed are grown is the central, limiting resource for food production. The amount of cropland needed depends on population numbers, average food consumption patterns, and output per unit of land. Around the globe, these factors show large differences. We use data from the Food and Agriculture Organization to consistently assess subcontinental dynamics of how much land was needed <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> the prevailing <b>diets</b> during a span of 46 y, from 1961 to 2007. We find that, in most regions, diets became richer while the land needed to feed one person decreased. A decomposition approach is used to quantify the contributions of the main drivers of cropland requirements for food: changes in population, agricultural technology, and diet. We compare the impact of these drivers for different subcontinents and find that potential land savings through yield increases were offset by a combination of population growth and dietary change. The dynamics of the three factors were the largest in developing regions and emerging economies. The results indicate an inverse relationship between the two main drivers behind increased land requirements for food: with socioeconomic development, population growth decreases and, at the same time, diets become richer. In many regions, dietary change may override population growth as major driver behind land requirements for food in the near future. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Artificial rearing {{of honey}} bee larvae is an {{established}} method which enables to fully standardize the rearing environment and <b>to</b> manipulate the <b>supplied</b> <b>diet</b> <b>to</b> the brood. However, {{there are no}} studies which compare learning performance or neuroanatomic differences of artificially-reared (in-lab) bees in comparison with their in-hive reared counterparts. Methods Here we tested how different quantities of food during larval development affect body size, brain morphology and learning ability of adult honey bees. We used in-lab rearing {{to be able to}} manipulate the total quantity of food consumed during larval development. After hatching, a subset of the bees was taken for which we made 3 D reconstructions of the brains using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Learning ability and memory formation of the remaining bees was tested in a differential olfactory conditioning experiment. Finally, we evaluated how bees reared with different quantities of artificial diet compared to in-hive reared bees. Results Thorax and head size of in-lab reared honey bees, when fed the standard diet of 160 µl or less, were slightly smaller than hive bees. The brain structure analyses showed that artificially reared bees had smaller mushroom body (MB) lateral calyces than their in-hive counterparts, independently of the quantity of food they received. However, they showed the same total brain size and the same associative learning ability as in-hive reared bees. In terms of mid-term memory, but not early long-term memory, they performed even better than the in-hive control. Discussion We have demonstrated that bees that are reared artificially (according to the Aupinel protocol) and kept in lab-conditions perform the same or even better than their in-hive sisters in an olfactory conditioning experiment even though their lateral calyces were consistently smaller at emergence. The applied combination of experimental manipulation during the larval phase plus subsequent behavioral and neuro-anatomic analyses is a powerful tool for basic and applied honey bee research...|$|R

40|$|The aim of feed {{formulation}} in aquaculture is <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> {{a suitable}} <b>diet</b> that provides nutritional requirements at relatively low cost. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} economic energy source for animals compared to protein and lipid; however, fish have limited capacity for dietary carbohydrate utilization. Trivalent chromium is an essential micronutrient for carbohydrate metabolism in vertebrates. The primary objective of this thesis was to enhance understanding {{of the effects of}} organic and inorganic forms of Cr on carbohydrate utilization, growth performance, gene expression and activity of specific key liver enzymes in carp Cyprinus carpio. In addition, effects of dietary Cr on body composition, Cr tissue content, blood cells DNA damage, and tissue histopathology (liver and gut) were evaluated. The first experiment (Chapter 3) tested levels of dietary Cr (0, 0. 2, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 mg Cr kg- 1 as Cr chloride) to determine Cr requirement; the second experiment (Chapter 4) compared bioavailability of different forms of Cr (Cr chloride, Cr picolinate, and Cr yeast); and the third experiment (Chapter 5) evaluated different levels of Cr yeast (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg Cr kg- 1) on utilization of a starch or dextrin-based diet. A Cr supplementation of 0. 5 mg Cr kg- 1 (regardless of form of Cr) produced highest growth performance; whereas 2. 0 mg Cr kg- 1 did not differ from control. The 0. 5 mg Cr kg- 1 also enabled carp to utilize complex carbohydrates (e. g., starch) and did not affect final body composition. Only 2. 0 mg Cr kg- 1 caused DNA damage in blood cells and tissue damage (liver and gut histopathology). Cr content in whole body increased with dietary Cr, but Cr did not affect hexokinase gene expression. Overall, results indicate that Cr can improve growth performance of carp and that Cr supplementation can enhance utilization of carbohydrates in fish feed.
