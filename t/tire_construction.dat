50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variables}} that determine rolling resistance: tire tread, width, diameter, <b>tire</b> <b>construction,</b> tube type (if applicable), and pressure are all important.|$|E
50|$|For road vehicles, {{the noise}} {{produced}} varies significantly with <b>tire</b> <b>construction,</b> road surface, and {{the magnitude of}} the deceleration. Noise can be caused by different things. These are signs that there may be issues with brakes wearing out over time.|$|E
50|$|The largest tire {{makers have}} {{internally}} developed automated tire-assembly machines {{in an effort}} to create competitive advantages in <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> precision, high production yield, and reduced labor. Nevertheless, there is a large base of machine builders who produce tire-building machines.|$|E

50|$|Another {{approach}} to preventing punctures of lightweight tires {{is to use}} kevlar belts in the <b>tire</b> tread <b>construction.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Bridgestone Corporation {{opened a}} plant in Kitakyushu to produce large and ultralarge off-the-road radial <b>tires</b> for <b>construction</b> and mining vehicles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>construction</b> methods vary {{somewhat}} {{in the number}} and type of components, {{as well as the}} compound formulations for each component, according to the tire use and price point. Tire makers continuously introduce new materials and construction methods in order to achieve higher performance at lower cost..|$|E
50|$|These {{characteristics}} are also affected by tire stagger (tires of different circumference at different {{positions on the}} car, the right rear having the most influence in left turns) and rubber compounds used in <b>tire</b> <b>construction.</b> These settings are determined by NASCAR and Goodyear engineers {{and may not be}} adjusted by individual teams.|$|E
5000|$|A {{radial tire}} (more properly, a radial-ply tire) is a {{particular}} design of vehicular tire. In this design, the cord plies are arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, or radially (from {{the center of the}} tire). Radial <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> climbed to 100% market share in North America, following Consumer Reports finding the superiority of the radial design in 1968.|$|E
50|$|Even if {{the slip}} angle and camber angle are zero, {{and the road}} is flat, this torque will still be {{generated}} due to asymmetries in the <b>tire's</b> <b>construction</b> and the asymmetrical shape and pressure distribution of the contact patch. Typically for a production tire this torque reaches a maximum at 2-4 degrees of slip (this figure is very dependent {{on a lot of}} things) and falls to zero as the tire reaches its maximum lateral force capability.|$|R
50|$|Rolling {{resistance}} is {{the resistance to}} rolling caused by deformation of the tire {{in contact with the}} road surface. As the tire rolls, tread enters the contact area and is deformed flat to conform to the roadway. The energy required to make the deformation depends on the inflation pressure, rotating speed, and numerous physical properties of the tire structure, such as spring force and stiffness. Tire makers seek lower rolling resistance <b>tire</b> <b>constructions</b> to improve fuel economy in cars and especially trucks, where rolling resistance accounts for a high proportion of fuel consumption.|$|R
50|$|Pacejka has {{developed}} a series of tire design models over the last 20 years. They were named the 'magic formula' {{because there is no}} particular physical basis for the structure of the equations chosen, but they fit a wide variety of <b>tire</b> <b>constructions</b> and operating conditions. Each tire is characterized by 10-20 coefficients for each important force that it can produce at the contact patch, typically lateral and longitudinal force, and self-aligning torque, as a best fit between experimental data and the model. These coefficients are then used to generate equations showing how much force is generated for a given vertical load on the tire, camber angle and slip angle.|$|R
5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire contact patch generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the cornering force. Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total cornering force. Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> and inflation pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Radial <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> {{utilizes}} {{body ply}} cords {{extending from the}} beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and {{in the context of}} off-roading, decreased [...] "self-cleaning" [...] ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.|$|E
5000|$|At the time, the U.S. tire {{industry}} built tires {{based on}} bias ply technology, dating to 1888. In 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction, which quickly spread in France, Michelin's home country. Because of its superiority in treadlife, handling, safety from blowouts, and fuel economy, {{use of this}} technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the bias-ply <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> persisted, caused by tire and automobile manufacturers in America [...] "concerned about transition costs." [...] In 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of radial construction, and in 1971 the Lincoln Continental Mark III became the first American made car with standard OEM radial tires.|$|E

5000|$|Wheels {{were changed}} from the [...] "F" [...] model to utilize 16 inch front and 17 inch rear NS type bolt {{together}} aluminum ComStar wheels. These wheels were constructed of a 5 pointed design which used bolts to connect the aluminum [...] "spokes" [...] to the hub and rim. The 16 inch front wheel was used to aid steering response, and the 17 inch rear saw the first use of radial <b>construction</b> <b>tire</b> for the European models. The American market models were sold with the traditional bias ply <b>construction</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
500|$|When the {{organization}} purchased the property, {{it was an}} empty lot next to a <b>tire</b> store. <b>Construction</b> of the facility triggered the development of hotels, restaurants, and the food hall Oxbow Public Market in downtown Napa and its Oxbow District. The museum began construction in 1999 and hosted opening celebrations on November 18, 2001. In 2005, Copia sold [...] to Intrawest for construction of a Westin hotel.|$|R
50|$|This {{contributed to}} {{build-up}} {{of heat and}} tire deterioration under sustained high speed use, and eventual failure {{of the most highly}} stressed tire. Of course, the possibility that slightly substandard <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> and slightly higher than average tire stress, neither of which would be problematic in themselves, would in combination result in tire failure is quite likely. The controversy continues without unequivocal conclusions, but it also brought public attention to a generally high incidence of rollover accidents involving SUVs, which the manufacturers continue to address in various ways. A subsequent NHTSA investigation of real world accident data showed that the SUVs in question were no more likely to roll over than any other SUV, after a tread separation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, Michelin {{developed}} the radial tire method of construction.

Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the outdated bias-ply <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> persisted, with market share of 87% as late as 1967.

50|$|See {{dependent}} and independent below.Camber changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance. In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical. Depending on the tire {{and the road}} surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle. Small changes in camber, front and rear, {{can be used to}} tune handling. Some race cars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber {{depending on the type of}} handling desired and the <b>tire</b> <b>construction.</b> Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in the suspension geometry. The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of the suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.|$|E

50|$|This {{sidewall}} ply to bead tension {{support was}} a big reason for older cross-ply cord <b>tire</b> <b>construction</b> using the materials available in the early 19th century. The cross-ply cord arrangement orients the cords to more directly support the bead & wheel rim (like a sling: bead to cord and around below the tread back to the opposite bead, both ways, thus crossing plies of cords). However, with improved combinations of cord, bead, rim materials, and manufacturing techniques, combined with ongoing focus and research on tire efficiency and durability, it became both feasible and desirable to manufacture radial-ply cord tires, which, for many applications (despite higher costs), outperform and more than outlast (reliable-usual-service-life/cost ratio) similar cross-ply cord tire designs by (a) facilitating a flatter contact pattern with more evenly distributed pressure on the momentarily stationary area of contact between tread & ground and (b) lower operating costs over time: due to reduced tire temperature, decreased rolling resistance, lower puncture rates, greater longevity, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The wheel size is the {{diameter}} of the wheel in inches where the beads of the tire sit on the wheel. This measurement does not include the rim flange. Modern road tires have several measurements associated with their size as specified by tire codes like 225/70R14. The first number in the code (e.g., [...] "225") represents the nominal tire width in millimeters. This is followed by the aspect ratio (e.g.,"70"), which is the height of the side wall expressed {{as a percentage of the}} nominal width. [...] "R" [...] stands for radial and relates to the <b>tire</b> <b>construction.</b> The final number in the code (e.g.,"14") is the rim size measured in inches. The overall circumference of the tire will increase by increasing any of the tire's specifications. For example, increasing the width of the tire will also increase its circumference, because the side wall height is a proportional length. Increasing the aspect ratio will increase the height of the tire and hence the circumference.|$|E
