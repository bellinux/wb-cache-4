5|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> may infect {{any part}} of the body, but most {{commonly}} occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary <b>tuberculosis).</b> Extrapulmonary TB occurs when <b>tuberculosis</b> develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.|$|E
5|$|Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin {{achieved}} the first genuine success in immunization against <b>tuberculosis</b> in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain <b>tuberculosis.</b> It was called bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). The BCG vaccine {{was first used}} on humans in 1921 in France, but received widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is <b>tuberculosis.</b> , <b>tuberculosis</b> appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting <b>tuberculosis</b> to other animals or visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of <b>tuberculosis</b> infections among eight workers.|$|E
5|$|Mycobacteria infect many {{different}} animals, including birds, rodents, and reptiles. The subspecies Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis,</b> though, is rarely present in wild animals. An effort to eradicate bovine <b>tuberculosis</b> caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand {{has been relatively}} successful. Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful.|$|E
5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and <b>tuberculosis.</b> In his {{research}} into <b>tuberculosis</b> Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if an organism {{is the cause of}} a disease, and these postulates are still used today.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{reactivation}} {{increases with}} immunosuppression, {{such as that}} caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with M. <b>tuberculosis</b> and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year. Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. <b>tuberculosis</b> strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought, with estimates that it might {{account for more than}} 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common. The chance of death from a case of <b>tuberculosis</b> is about 4% as of 2008, down from 8% in 1995.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> {{has been}} present in humans since antiquity. The {{earliest}} unambiguous detection of M. <b>tuberculosis</b> involves {{evidence of the}} disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. However, whether <b>tuberculosis</b> originated in bovines, then was transferred to humans, or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear. A comparison of the genes of M. <b>tuberculosis</b> complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as was previously believed. Both strains of the <b>tuberculosis</b> bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution. Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000–2400 BC. Genetic studies suggest TB was present in the Americas from about 100 AD.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> is the second-most {{common cause}} of death from {{infectious}} disease (after those due to HIV/AIDS). The total number of <b>tuberculosis</b> cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002. China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014. <b>Tuberculosis</b> {{is more common in}} developing countries; about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the US population test positive. Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated <b>tuberculosis,</b> and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In The Canon of Medicine (1020), Avicenna {{suggested}} that <b>tuberculosis</b> {{and other diseases}} might be contagious.|$|E
5|$|Loving {{continued}} as the band's director until {{being forced to}} take a medical leave in 1915 due to <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{disease states}} can also {{increase}} the risk of developing <b>tuberculosis.</b> These include alcoholism and diabetes mellitus (three-fold increase).|$|E
5|$|The M. <b>tuberculosis</b> complex (MTBC) {{includes}} four other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of <b>tuberculosis</b> in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of <b>tuberculosis,</b> but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and US {{government}} are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic <b>tuberculosis</b> test {{for use in}} low- and middle-income countries. In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV. Many resource-poor places as of 2011 have access to only sputum microscopy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening {{people who are at}} high risk for latent <b>tuberculosis</b> with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve these}} targets, China needs to address {{existing}} challenges to {{its efforts to}} control <b>tuberculosis.</b> Foremost is the serious epidemic of MDR <b>tuberculosis.</b> WHO estimates {{that a third of}} the world's cases of MDR <b>tuberculosis</b> are in China, even though the country has only 15% of the global burden of <b>tuberculosis.</b> The recent expansion of DOTS should help to limit the development of MDR <b>tuberculosis.</b> But reduction of the existing burden of multidrug resistance will take time, especially since poor-quality DOTS services in some areas and inappropriate treatment of <b>tuberculosis</b> in parts of the hospital system continue to generate new cases of MDR <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Against this backdrop, {{the central}} {{government}} began efforts to revitalise its <b>tuberculosis</b> control program in 2000. Most important was the increased political commitment to tackle <b>tuberculosis.</b> In March 2000, the Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang and Vice-Minister of Finance Gao Qiang attended the Ministerial Conference on <b>Tuberculosis</b> and Sustainable Development in Amsterdam, where they committed to strengthen the country's efforts to control <b>tuberculosis.</b> In December 2000, the State Council of China held a nationwide video-teleconference on <b>tuberculosis.</b> Vice-Premier Li Lanqing gave explicit instructions to strengthen the <b>tuberculosis</b> control effort. In October 2001, the government issued the second 10-year plan (2001–10) to control <b>tuberculosis.</b> In 2002, {{the central government}} increased its funding for <b>tuberculosis</b> from US$300 000 per year to $4·8 million per year.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{may also}} play a role in Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis,</b> which is the agent that causes <b>tuberculosis</b> in humans. Experimentation {{suggests}} that sulfatide may be involved in Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> infection, and it may be an element of the cell wall of the bacteria Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> {{control has}} been a part of China's public health program since the 1950s. China {{developed}} and implemented two 5-year national plans in the 1980s and one 10-year plan in the 1990s to control <b>tuberculosis.</b> On the basis of national surveys in 1979 and 1990, the prevalence of <b>tuberculosis</b> fell by an average of 3.3% every year during the 1980s. In the 1990s, the government implemented two major <b>tuberculosis</b> control projects as part of its 10-year plan to control <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite these achievements, {{there were}} signs of {{difficulties}} elsewhere in the country's <b>tuberculosis</b> control program. In the half of China that did not implement the project funded by the World Bank, the prevalence of <b>tuberculosis</b> did not fall during the 1990s. Thus, the fall in <b>tuberculosis</b> prevalence for the entire country slowed to 2.5% per year during the 1990s. The 2000 national <b>tuberculosis</b> survey revealed that one in ten patients with <b>tuberculosis</b> had multi-drug resistant (MDR) disease — i.e., resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. Other studies confirmed a serious epidemic of MDR <b>tuberculosis</b> in several Chinese provinces, with rates of multidrug resistance in previously untreated cases that were five to ten times higher than the global mean.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2003, the SARS {{epidemic}} brought China to {{a virtual}} standstill. Most <b>tuberculosis</b> control activities {{came to a}} stop. However, after the SARS epidemic had been successfully controlled, <b>tuberculosis</b> control activities picked up rapidly {{in the second half}} of the year. By the end of 2003, 43% of the estimated total new cases of smear-positive <b>tuberculosis</b> had been diagnosed and treated in the country's DOTS program. With further acceleration of <b>tuberculosis</b> control efforts, 64% and 80% of these cases were diagnosed and treated in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The acceleration of efforts to control <b>tuberculosis</b> after the SARS epidemic would not have been possible if the government had not laid the foundation to revitalize the <b>tuberculosis</b> control program before 2003. However, the gains in <b>tuberculosis</b> control after SARS also resulted from measures to improve the public health system.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} <b>tuberculosis.</b> For active <b>tuberculosis</b> it is often used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended {{for the treatment of}} latent <b>tuberculosis.</b> It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> not {{affecting}} the lungs is called extra-pulmonary <b>tuberculosis.</b> Disease {{of the central}} nervous system is specifically excluded from this classification.|$|E
25|$|Cambodia {{is one of}} 22 {{countries}} {{listed by}} WHO as having a high burden of <b>tuberculosis.</b> WHO estimates that 64% of all Cambodians carry the <b>tuberculosis</b> mycobacterium. Hence, MSF has since shifted its focus away from HIV/AIDS to <b>tuberculosis,</b> handing over most HIV-related programs to local health authorities.|$|E
25|$|The tree-in-bud sign {{may appear}} on the chest CTs of some {{patients}} affected by <b>tuberculosis,</b> {{but it is not}} specific to <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Global {{resistance}} of <b>tuberculosis</b> to pyrazinamide {{has been estimated}} to be in 16% of all cases, and 60% of people with multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1902, the International Conference on <b>Tuberculosis</b> {{convened in}} Berlin. Among various other acts, the conference {{proposed}} the Cross of Lorraine be the international {{symbol of the}} fight against <b>tuberculosis.</b> National campaigns spread across Europe and the United States to tamp down on the continued prevalence of <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2007, the Chinese {{government}} {{undertook a}} review of the <b>tuberculosis</b> situation in China, which looked at the progress in <b>tuberculosis</b> control before the SARS epidemic, outlined the measures taken to improve the public health system after that epidemic, described how those measures contributed to the acceleration of <b>tuberculosis</b> control efforts, and discuss the challenges that China must address to halve the number of <b>tuberculosis</b> cases and deaths as part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} also organised {{a partnership with}} international agencies to support the country's efforts to control <b>tuberculosis.</b> Early in 2002, the government signed a 7-year, $104 million loan with the World Bank, which included blended grant funding from the UK's Department for International Development; also, the Japanese government began to provide free antituberculosis drugs in 12 provinces. In late 2002, China received a $48 million grant from the Global Fund to fight AIDS, <b>Tuberculosis</b> and Malaria to tackle <b>tuberculosis.</b> The Damien Foundation Belgium and the Canadian International Development Agency have supported efforts to control <b>tuberculosis</b> in several provinces. WHO served as the lead technical agency, providing policy and technical support to the national <b>tuberculosis</b> program. WHO sent an in-country adviser and many short-term consultants; the KNCV <b>Tuberculosis</b> Foundation also provided valuable technical support. By late 2002, with increased governmental and international support, DOTS began to expand to all provinces.|$|E
25|$|In China, <b>tuberculosis</b> {{has been}} the number 1 cause of death from {{infectious}} disease in adults. In 1990, 360,000 people in China died from <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} attempts {{he was able}} to incubate the bacteria in coagulated blood serum at 37 degrees Celsius. He then inoculated laboratory rabbits with the bacteria and observed that they died while exhibiting symptoms of <b>tuberculosis,</b> proving that the bacillus, which he named <b>tuberculosis</b> bacillus, was in fact the cause of <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{measures}} {{contributed to}} acceleration {{in efforts to}} control <b>tuberculosis.</b> By 2005, the detection of cases of <b>tuberculosis</b> had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global <b>tuberculosis</b> control targets. At the same time, specific efforts to improve <b>tuberculosis</b> control also contributed to strengthening {{of the public health}} system. In this case, the strengthening of the disease control program and the public health system had worked together to achieve a desired health outcome.|$|E
25|$|One-third of the world's current {{population}} has been infected with Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis,</b> and new infections occur {{at a rate of}} one per second. About 5–10% of these latent infections will eventually progress to active disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than half of its victims. Annually, 8 million people become ill with <b>tuberculosis,</b> and 2 million people die from the disease worldwide. In the 19th century, <b>tuberculosis</b> killed an estimated one-quarter of the adult population of Europe; by 1918, one in six deaths in France were still caused by <b>tuberculosis.</b> During the 20th century, <b>tuberculosis</b> killed approximately 100 million people. TB {{is still one of the}} most important health problems in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{strengthened}} public-health {{system has}} accelerated the national <b>tuberculosis</b> control effort, progress in <b>tuberculosis</b> control has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national <b>tuberculosis</b> control program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies {{based on the}} DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one financing plan with clear funding needs and gaps—another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control <b>tuberculosis</b> in the past—when <b>tuberculosis</b> services were not free—and the success in <b>tuberculosis</b> control {{over the past few}} years—when <b>tuberculosis</b> services have been free—have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS—e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs—are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the <b>tuberculosis</b> program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the <b>tuberculosis</b> program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the <b>tuberculosis</b> control program {{is one of the best}} examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.|$|E
25|$|Another {{challenge}} is to make <b>tuberculosis</b> services accessible to the entire population. Although China has a policy of free <b>tuberculosis</b> services, in most places these are available only to permanent residents in a particular community. Urban migrants, who have relocated from poor rural areas to seek a better livelihood, {{are not eligible for}} such free services. These vulnerable, predominantly young migrants—now numbering more than 150 million—tend to live and work in crowded environments and are unlikely to seek medical care when they become ill. Such individuals contribute to the spread of <b>tuberculosis,</b> HIV infection, and other infectious diseases within urban centers. The growing epidemic of co-infection with <b>tuberculosis</b> and HIV if left unchecked will substantially increase the number of <b>tuberculosis</b> cases and deaths.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide {{was first}} {{discovered}} and patented in 1936 but not used against <b>tuberculosis</b> until 1952. Its discovery as an anti-tubercular agent was remarkable {{since it has}} no activity against <b>tuberculosis</b> in-vitro, due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily {{not be expected to}} work in-vivo. However, it was known that nicotinamide had activity against <b>tuberculosis</b> and pyrazinamide was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at Lederle and Merck confirmed its ability to kill <b>tuberculosis</b> and it was rapidly used in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberculosis</b> is a {{major public}} health problem in China. China has the world's third largest cases of <b>tuberculosis</b> (after India and Indonesia), but {{progress}} in <b>tuberculosis</b> control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of <b>tuberculosis</b> had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> was a major problem. These signs of inadequate <b>tuberculosis</b> control {{can be linked to}} a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public health system. After the government realized the impact that the SARS outbreak had on the country, they increased leadership in their health department. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public health problems and, among other efforts, increased public health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system to improve transparency, reach and speed, and started a program to rebuild local public health facilities and national infrastructure.|$|E
