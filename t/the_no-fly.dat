5|$|On 24 March 2011 it was {{reported}} that an AASM missile fired from a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet, the first Libyan warplane to challenge <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone during the 2011 Libyan civil war, on the runway just after the plane had landed at Misrata Airport.|$|E
5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations in support of <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, {{he may have been}} deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that the wing had a flying mission, the wing {{deployed}} to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force. In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol <b>the</b> <b>No-Fly</b> Zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E

25|$|In March 2011, B-2s {{were the}} first U.S. {{aircraft}} into action in Operation Odyssey Dawn, the UN mandated enforcement of <b>the</b> Libyan <b>no-fly</b> zone. Three B-2s dropped 40 bombs on a Libyan airfield in support of <b>the</b> UN <b>no-fly</b> zone. <b>The</b> B-2s flew directly from the U.S. mainland across the Atlantic Ocean to Libya; a B-2 was refueled by allied tanker aircraft four times during each round trip mission.|$|R

5|$|On 28 August 1995, {{a mortar}} shell {{slammed into a}} Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone over Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air Force, {{including}} the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, flew the F-16 in combat during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 {{and in the}} Balkans later in the 1990s. F-16s also patrolled <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zones in Iraq during Operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch and served during the wars in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) from 2001 and 2003 respectively. In 2011, Air Force F-16s {{took part in the}} intervention in Libya.|$|E

5|$|The {{first serious}} {{violation}} to <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down {{four of the}} six Serb jets over Banja Luka. This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the Banja Luka incident was also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} of Deny Flight spanned {{more than two}} years of the Bosnian War and {{played an important role in}} the course of that conflict. <b>The</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone {{operations of}} Deny Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, the air strikes flown during Deny Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.|$|E
5|$|Between 1991 and 1995, the 102d {{deployed}} to Panama {{as part of}} Operation Coronet Nighthawk, which was a drug interdiction operation. In 1992 the wing became simply the 102d Fighter Wing {{as part of an}} Air Force-wide renaming of units. The wing was deployed from 1995 to 1998 to Iceland for periodic 45-day deployments. In 1998, the wing's members also trained and {{deployed to}} Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe. The next year, the 102d participated in Operation Northern Watch and was deployed to Turkey in order to enforce <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone over Iraq north of the 36th Parallel. In 2000, personnel were deployed to the Middle East and Europe in order to participate in Operation Southern Watch.|$|E

50|$|In April-May 1999, {{a number}} of Virginia ANG munitions {{personnel}} deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, with personnel from the Florida Air National Guard to fill critical munitions slots in maintaining <b>the</b> northern <b>no-fly</b> zone. At <b>the</b> same time, personnel from the 192nd Communications Flight, Military Personnel Flight, Security Forces Squadron, Services Squadron and Civil Engineer Squadron deployed to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, to support U.S. Air Force contingency activities to guard and protect <b>the</b> southern <b>no-fly</b> zone.|$|R
5|$|In October and November 1994, {{during the}} Siege of Bihać, the Muslim-Croat Federation {{launched}} a large offensive {{around the town}} of Bihać, in far northwestern Bosnia. The Serbs soon launched a counterattack, and in support of their operations, launched air strikes with aircraft based at a former JNA military airport in Udbina, south of Bihać, located in the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Serb aircraft dropped napalm and cluster bombs. Although most of the ordnance came from old, unreliable stocks and failed to explode, the attacks were a clear violation of <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone, and a challenge to NATO. NATO immediately looked for ways to respond, but its forces were not permitted to carry out operations in Croatian airspace, and due to Bihać's proximity to the border, Serb aircraft could attack into Bosnia, then cross back into Croatia before being intercepted. As such, NATO was powerless to stop the incursions.|$|E
5|$|In the conflict's {{early months}} it {{appeared}} that Gaddafi's government—with its greater fire-power—would be victorious. Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the United Arab Emirates provided the NTC with weaponry and training. NATO {{announced that it would}} enforce <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone. On 30 April a NATO air strike killed Gaddafi's sixth son and three of his grandsons in Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|Following the Persian Gulf War, {{to protect}} {{minority}} populations, the US, Britain, and France declared and maintained no-fly zones in {{northern and southern}} Iraq, which the Iraqi military frequently tested. <b>The</b> <b>no-fly</b> zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although France withdrew from participation in patrolling <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zones in 1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the intervention, the coalition of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, UK and US expanded to 17 states. Newer states mostly enforced <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone and naval blockade or provided military logistical assistance. The effort was initially largely led by the United States. NATO took control of the arms embargo on 23 March, named Operation Unified Protector. An attempt to unify the military command of the air campaign (while keeping political and strategic control with a small group), first failed due to objections by the French, German, and Turkish governments. On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone, while command of targeting ground units remained with coalition forces.|$|E
25|$|On 24 March, NATO ambassadors {{agreed that}} NATO would take command of <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone enforcement, while other {{military}} operations remained {{the responsibility of}} the group of states previously involved, with NATO expected to take control as early as 26 March. The decision was made after meetings of NATO members to resolve disagreements over whether military operations in Libya should include attacks on ground forces. The decision will create a two-level power structure overseeing military operations. In charge politically will be a committee, led by NATO, that includes all states participating in enforcing <b>the</b> <b>no-fly</b> zone, while NATO alone will be responsible for military action. Royal Canadian Air Force Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard has been appointed to command the NATO military mission.|$|E
