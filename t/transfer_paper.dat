25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided {{he had had}} enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He {{was at the top of}} his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic <b>transfer</b> <b>paper</b> of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he sat with her. She died a few months later.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{convenient}} when marking finger prints {{with letters}} for reference, {{to use those}} that look alike, both in a direct and in a reversed aspect, as they may require to be read either way. The print is a reversed picture of the pattern upon the digit that made it. The pattern on one hand is, as already said, a reversed picture of a similar pattern as it shows on the other. In the various processes by which prints are multiplied, the patterns may be reversed and re-reversed. Thus, if a finger is impressed on a lithographic stone, the impressions from that stone are reversals of the impression made by the same finger upon paper. If made on <b>transfer</b> <b>paper</b> and thence transferred to stone, there is a re-reversal. There are even more varied possibilities when photography is employed. It is worth recollecting that there are twelve capital letters in the English alphabet which, if printed in block type, are unaffected by being reversed. They are A.H.I.M.O.T.U.V.W.X.Y.Z. Some symbols do the same, such as, * + - = :. These and the letters H.O.I.X. have the further peculiarity of appearing unaltered when upside down.|$|E

50|$|Carbon tissue, a {{layer of}} unsensitized {{pigmented}} gelatin on a thin paper support sheet, was introduced by British physicist and chemist Joseph Swan in 1864. Marketing began in 1866. Initially, his ready-made tissues were sold in only three colors: black, sepia and purple-brown. Eventually, {{a wide array of}} hues became available. Carbon tissue was a stock item in Europe and the US well into the 20th century, but by the 1950s carbon printing was very rare and supplies for it became an exotic specialty item.
