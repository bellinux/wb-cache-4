This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> on the first floor.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chapel</b> {{replaced}} the Mosley Street Chapel (built 1789, demolished 1836) upon its completion for baptisms, burials and marriages. It was originally constructed for the Unitarians. <b>The</b> <b>chapel</b> {{was used for}} burial rites until 1882, <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> had a graveyard from the outset, to both {{the north and south}} sides of <b>the</b> <b>chapel.</b> Restrictions were placed on this in 1856 and prohibited in 1882 except for the removal of remains from graves on the north side to brick vaults {{on the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>chapel.</b> Baptisms were performed until at least 1912, and marriages until at least 1916. Ministers at <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> include John James Tayler (until 1853), William Henry Herford (1866–70), Philip Wicksteed (circa 1890), John Trevor (1890–91, left to start The Labour Church) and Edward Walker Sealy (1910-???).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chapel</b> {{was sold}} in 1928 due {{to changes in the}} district, and was {{subsequently}} used as a Welsh Baptist Chapel. <b>The</b> <b>chapel</b> was then used as a Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall in the early 1970s. The most recent use of both <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> and former Sunday School was for the Islamic Academy of Manchester between 1974 and 2006, when it was used as a mosque, teaching centre and for outreach work in the Asian community. <b>The</b> <b>chapel</b> is currently vacant, with the Islamic Academy occupying the Sunday School. The building has been owned by Manchester City Council since the 1970s, who purchased land alongside Upper Brook Street with the aim of constructing a large motorway into Manchester, which was never realised.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chapel,</b> {{which is}} on a small hill to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century. It was {{modified}} from the late 15th to late 16th century, when a Perpendicular Gothic, five-light east window and transepts were added. Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short nave and a large six-light west window, and that <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was disused by this time, as it had no roof. The west façade of <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was later demolished and the chancel arch was built up {{to form a new}} one with a Gibbs surround. A bell-turret was added c.1805. On the north and south sides of <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> are two transeptal, semi-octagonal bays.|$|E
5000|$|Inside {{the church}} is a double-chamfered chancel arch, and arches between the chancel and <b>the</b> <b>chapels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chapels</b> have wooden barrel roofs.

[...] On the {{sanctuary}} walls are paintings by Clayton and Bell dating from about 1886. Between the chancel and <b>the</b> <b>chapels</b> are 19th-century screens.

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the north tower was also burned. <b>The</b> <b>chapel</b> was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{known as}} the Carnary chapel and college, the complex was {{originally}} formed of separate buildings which were later joined together. The entrance porch to <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was added between 1446 and 1472 during the episcopate of Walter Lyhart, Bishop of Norwich. The crypt beneath <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> {{was used as a}} charnel house administered by the sacristan of the cathedral which stored the bones of people buried in the churches of the city to await resurrection, and the ocular windows of <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> would allow visitors to view the charnel remains. From 1421 to 1476 the crypt was also the location of the Wodehous chantry, established by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The college was dissolved in 1547 during the English Reformation by the Abolition of Chantries Act before being purchased by the city in 1550, and used by the school shortly after. Until the 19th century <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was used as the main classroom, though it was not until 1908 <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> returned to the role of religious assembly and 1940 when it was consecrated for use as a church, due to the cost of refurbishment.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> means they are difficult to assess.

5|$|Following the Ottoman {{withdrawal}} from Niš in 1878, the tower was roofed over, and in 1892 a chapel was built around it. In 1937, <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was renovated. A bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and {{came under the}} protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> occurred again in 1989. As of 2013, 54 skulls remain on the tower. The one that is said to belong to Sinđelić is enclosed in a glass container. Seen as a symbol of independence by Serbs, the tower is mentioned in the writings of French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine and English travel writer Alexander William Kinglake.
