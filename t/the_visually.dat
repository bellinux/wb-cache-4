5|$|Access {{to parts}} of the station is {{difficult}} for people with physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers found them unreliable and frequently broken down.

5|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was refurbished by Metronet during 2005 and 2006. Works included provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E

5|$|There are 59spaces {{available}} in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters.

5|$|These {{reactions}} {{have also}} {{brought about a}} change in policies. The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children—including <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers {{on how to deal}} with children with learning disabilities.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present accessories, {{techniques}} and systems which enable <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired {{to move in}} urban traffic. <b>The</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired participate in traffic as pedestrians, passengers in cars and in means of public transport etc. This thesis is therefore designed so that it covers all these fields. The survey {{at the end of}} the thesis presents the needs and thoughts of <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired as well as the views of those who can see on the involvement of <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired in traffic. A special emphasis is on planning and designing of an open space for <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired as well as on the importance of proper selection of materials, colours and techniques during the planning. The examples of practice include a presentation of a few points for <b>the</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired in Ljubljana which are more or less successfully placed in the environment...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|Bor is a {{guide for}} {{visually}} impaired skiers. In this role, he skis in front of <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> impaired skier and gives him or her direction to get down the course using speakers and a microphone. At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Bor served as an Australian assistant coach. In 2009, following those Games, he shifted his role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced further in the sport. He first skied with Perrine at a World Cup event in January 2010 where they finished fourth.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, but not with <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is {{important in terms of}} marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E

5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 is one of <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) {{does not have enough}} mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; {{the alternative}} name Capra was {{more commonly used}} in classical times. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table {{of the first two}} batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star with the designations α Aurigae, HR 1708, HD 34029, and HIP 24608, which suggests only the primary component of the Capella system should receive that name. The IAU's own documentation makes it explicit that the proper name should strictly only be applied to <b>the</b> <b>visually</b> brightest component. In this case it is somewhat uncertain which of the components is the brightest and the IAU list does not specify.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.
