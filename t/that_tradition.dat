5|$|Ahead of the 2011 season, NFF and NTF {{stated that}} Superfinalen would be discontinued, {{stating that the}} {{championship}} was interesting neither from a sports nor from a commercial aspect. However, the two would-be qualified teams, league winner Rosenborg and cup winner Strømsgodset, were free to play a pre-season friendly, although {{it would not be}} regarded as an official match. Rosenborg has traditionally played its final pre-season game against Viking and stated that they intended to take up <b>that</b> <b>tradition</b> following the abandoning of Superfinalen.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for <b>that</b> <b>tradition,</b> he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|In the Great Lakes {{region of}} the United States, there is an annual Woollybear Festival that has been celebrated for over 40 years. The larvae of the species Pyrrharctia isabella (commonly known as the Isabella Tiger moth), with their 13 {{distinct}} segments of black and reddish-brown, have the reputation in common folklore {{of being able to}} forecast the coming winter weather. From 1948, C. H. Curran, curator of insects at the American Museum of Natural History, counted the caterpillars in Bear Mountain State Park in an attempt to validate <b>that</b> <b>tradition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon <b>that</b> <b>tradition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of <b>that</b> <b>tradition</b> and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, <b>that</b> <b>tradition</b> superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E

5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within <b>that</b> <b>tradition.</b> Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use free verse.|$|E
5|$|El Greco {{was born}} in Crete, which {{was at that time}} part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within <b>that</b> <b>tradition</b> before {{traveling}} at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on <b>that</b> <b>tradition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rationalizing hermeneutics of myth {{became even}} more popular under the Roman Empire, thanks to the physicalist {{theories}} of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy. Stoics presented explanations of the gods and heroes as physical phenomena, while the Euhemerists rationalized them as historical figures. At the same time, the Stoics and the Neoplatonists promoted the moral significations of the mythological tradition, often based on Greek etymologies. Through his Epicurean message, Lucretius had sought to expel superstitious fears from the minds of his fellow-citizens. Livy, too, is skeptical about the mythological tradition and claims {{that he does not}} intend to pass judgement on such legends (fabulae). The challenge for Romans with a strong and apologetic sense of religious tradition was to defend <b>that</b> <b>tradition</b> while conceding that it was often a breeding-ground for superstition. The antiquarian Varro, who regarded religion as a human institution with great importance for the preservation of good in society, devoted rigorous study to the origins of religious cults. In his Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum (which has not survived, but Augustine's City of God indicates its general approach) Varro argues that whereas the superstitious man fears the gods, the truly religious person venerates them as parents. According to Varro, there have been three accounts of deities in the Roman society: the mythical account created by poets for theatre and entertainment, the civil account used by people for veneration {{as well as by the}} city, and the natural account created by the philosophers. The best state is, adds Varro, where the civil theology combines the poetic mythical account with the philosopher's.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} one is known as Maha Devale or Maha Kovil and is dedicated to Skanda-Murugan known amongst the Sinhalese as Kataragama deviyo. It {{does not have a}} statute of the deity; instead it holds a Yantra, a spiritual drawing of the deity's power. Of all the shrines in the complex, it is the largest and the first that all pilgrims come to visit. Although it does not have a representation of the deity, kept in an adjoining room is a statue of Shiva also known amongst Sinhalese as Karanduva. Within it there is a clay arm chair known as Kalana Mandima that supposedly belonged to Kalyanagiri Swamy. It is covered by a leopard’s skin and on it has all the ceremonial instruments. To the left of the main shrine lies a smaller shrine dedicated to Hindu god Ganesha who is known as Ganapatidevio amongst Sinhalese. Tamils refer to him as the Manica Pillaiyar as well. It too is a small rectangular building without any decoration. To the left of Ganesha shrine stands the Vishnu Devale the shrine dedicated to Vishnu within which there is also a Buddha image. Behind this is a large Bo tree <b>that</b> <b>tradition</b> holds as sprung from the sapling of the original Bo tree in Anuradhapura, hence is very much held in high esteem by the visiting Buddhists.|$|E

25|$|As {{a school}} of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Chan draws many of its basic driving {{concepts}} from <b>that</b> <b>tradition,</b> such as the Bodhisattva ideal. Karuṇā is the counterpart of prajna. Avalokiteśvara embodies the striving for Karuna, compassion.|$|E
