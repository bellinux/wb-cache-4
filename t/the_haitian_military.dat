5|$|Schneider {{left the}} Press in 1991, {{shortly before the}} {{newspaper}} was bought by the rival Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ceased publication. He spent several years at the Scripps-Howard Newspapers bureau in Washington D.C. as a reporter and assistant managing editor for investigations. While assigned to a medical story in Haiti in 1994, Schneider elected to stay behind during a U.S. military intervention to cover the overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Another USCGA {{graduate}} was Lieutenant John Gazzo Martinez, who {{was born}} in New Orleans and entered the service during World War II. He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the LORAN Transmitting Station in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in LORAN (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to the Haitian Garde-Cotes d'Haiti. He taught classes for <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> leadership and later oversaw the overhaul of Garde-Cotes patrol vessels.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
50|$|The {{murder of}} Fritz D'Or, or Fritz Dor, (ca. 1953 - 15 March 1991), {{was the second}} {{in a string of}} {{political}} attacks by supporters of <b>the</b> former <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> regime who were opposed to Aristide. D'Or was a US Haitian journalist and radio talk show host for WLQY-AM (1320). He was assassinated by Billy Alexander in Miami, Florida for voicing his support for <b>the</b> new <b>Haitian</b> democracy and President Aristide.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 1991 <b>Haitian</b> coup d'état {{took place}} on 29 September 1991, when President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, elected 8 months earlier in <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> general election, 1990-1991, was deposed by <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> army. <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> officers, {{primarily}} Army General Raoul Cédras, Army Chief of Staff Phillipe Biamby and Chief of the National Police, Michel François led the coup. Aristide was sent into exile, his life only saved by the intervention of US, French and Venezuelan diplomats.|$|R
50|$|In early January 1999, Pina {{moved to}} Port-au-Prince {{where he lived}} and worked {{for the next seven}} years. He was the first {{journalist}} to write that paramilitary forces of <b>the</b> former <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> and <b>the</b> Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), operating in the neighboring Dominican Republic, were being used {{as part of a larger}} strategy to oust the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in April 2003.|$|R
25|$|The {{unstable}} {{situation in}} Haiti, where elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide had been ousted from office {{by the military}} in September 1991, presented another regional problem. The United States pressured the military government to restore Aristide. In July 1993, <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> regime agreed to reinstate Aristide by October 30, 1993, but then refused to step down. In October, in an effort Clinton approved even though Aspin opposed it, the United States sent the USS Harlan County carrying 200 troops to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Met by a hostile mob of armed Haitians, the ship turned away without attempting to undertake its mission, which the Pentagon described {{as an effort to}} professionalize <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> and undertake civil assistance projects. Some observers attacked Aspin for not taking a harder stand in the administration against an action he opposed and then aborting the effort in the face of local opposition.|$|E
25|$|In 1810 he was {{appointed}} to the Horse Guards under President Pétion. During the next four decades he continued to serve in <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>Military,</b> rising to the rank of Colonel under President Guerrier, until finally promoted to the highest command in the Haitian Army, attaining the rank of Lieutenant General and Supreme Commander of the Presidential Guards under then President Jean-Baptiste Riché.|$|E
25|$|Under {{president}} Aristide's leadership, {{his party}} implemented many major reforms. These included greatly increasing {{access to health}} care and education for the general population, increasing adult literacy and protections for those accused of crimes, improving training for judges, prohibiting human trafficking, disbanding <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> (which primarily had been used against the Haitian people), establishing improved human rights and political freedom; doubling the minimum wage, instituting land reform and assistance to small farmers, providing boat construction training to fishermen, establishing a food distribution network to provide low cost food to the poor at below market prices, building low-cost housing, and attempting to reduce the level of government corruption.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this trade with the US, the coup regime was supported by massive profits from the drug trade thanks to <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>military's</b> affiliation with <b>the</b> Cali Cartel; Aristide publicly stated that his own pursuit of arresting drug dealers was one event that prompted the coup by drug-affiliated military officials Raul Cedras and Michel Francois (a claim echoed by his former secretary of State Patrick Elie). Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan) {{expressed concern that the}} only US government agency to publicly recognize <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> junta's role in drug trafficking was the DEA, and that, despite a wealth of evidence provided by the DEA proving the junta's drug connections, the Clinton administration downplayed this factor rather than use it as a hedge against the junta (as the US government had done against Manuel Noriega). Nairn in particular alleged that the CIA's connections to these drug traffickers in the junta not only dated to the creation of SIN, but were ongoing during and after the coup. Nairn's claims are confirmed in part by revelations of Emmanuel Constant regarding the ties of his FRAPH organization to the CIA before and during the coup government.|$|R

From 1989 to 2008, Martelly recorded over a dozen studio albums and a number of live CDs.

5000|$|François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture ( [...] 20 May 1743 - 7 April 1803), {{also known}} as Toussaint L'Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda, was the best-known leader of <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> Revolution.

50|$|Threats to Haiti's {{internal}} security, however, {{have been}} numerous during the past four decades.

An airplane dropped a bomb on the National Palace in 1982, and a car bomb exploded nearby in 1983. Exile groups, however, never posed a significant military challenge to the army and the VSN.

On multiple occasions, the military investigated the medical complex, threatening to shut it down, or to attack the staff. Only the threat that Zanmi Lasante was the best chance at healing a Haitian soldier when he inevitably became ill was enough to deter them. The clinic saw three years of hardship, with patients afraid to seek medical treatment for fear of getting attacked by Haitian Junta, and Farmer forbidden from entering the country. Fortunately, Aristide was reinstated as president in 1994, and Partners in Health was able to continue improving upon Zanmi Lasante.|$|R
