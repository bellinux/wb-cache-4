5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio {{intercept}} equipment identified <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for <b>the</b> <b>convoy,</b> issued {{a report of the}} German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking <b>the</b> <b>convoy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>convoy</b> was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed the majority of <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank only five of the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated in {{his efforts}} to {{intercept}} <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> at anchor, Willaumez determined to meet it at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for <b>the</b> <b>convoy,</b> seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for <b>the</b> <b>convoy,</b> Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E

After spending five days at Halifax, she sailed as part of Convoy SC 72 to Clyde on 28 February. After arriving at Clyde on 17 March, West Cheswald {{made her way to}} Oban on 22 March and sailed four days later for Murmansk as part of Convoy PQ 14. <b>The</b> <b>convoy</b> consisted of approximately 25 merchant ships, ten of which were American, and of the American ships, only two—West Cheswald and Yaka—possessed defensive weaponry manned by Naval Armed Guardsmen. Many ships turned back because of heavy fog and snow; West Cheswald, Yaka and several other ships from <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> remained at Reykjavík from 31 March to 8 April. On 15 April, <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> was tracked by a German aircraft, and convoy escort ships made contact with three German destroyers. The following day, <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> commodore's ship was sunk by a submarine; at least two other torpedoes traveled through <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> without hitting any ships. <b>The</b> <b>convoy</b> came under air attack on 17 April, but suffered no losses.

Despite those difficulties, <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E

After <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> arrived on 3 November, Ocean began making preparations for the attack on Basra. Numerous small craft were armed to enter the Shatt al-Arab, the river leading to Basra. The first objective was to silence the old fortress at Al-Faw. On 5 November, Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire, and the next morning, Ocean began the bombardment of Al-Faw. A landing party of 600 men, some of whom came from Oceans detachment of Royal Marines, stormed the fortress and captured it, having encountered no resistance.|$|E

Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of <b>the</b> <b>convoy,</b> ordered <b>the</b> <b>convoy</b> to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors.
