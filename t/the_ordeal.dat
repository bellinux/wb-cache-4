5|$|Pantulf {{regained his}} lands after he cleared {{himself of the}} charge, through the {{mechanism}} of a trial by ordeal. It is not clear why <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> was required, with the historian David Bates speculating that either the evidence of Pantulf's involvement was not conclusive or that murder victim's family demanded <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> because they suspected any evidence pointing to Pantulf's innocence. Pantulf gave Saint-Evroul four altar frontals for the abbey's help after he was cleared of the charges.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Madagascar could accuse {{one another}} of various crimes, {{including}} theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> of tangena was routinely obligatory. On average, an estimated 20 to 50 {{percent of those}} who underwent <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> died. In the 1820s, the tangena ordeal caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina {{died as a result of}} the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population. Although outlawed in 1863, <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> continued to be practiced secretly in Imerina and openly in other parts of the island.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{problems}} {{relating to}} the execution and settlement, the praxis of <b>the</b> <b>ordeals</b> persisted through several decades through the Middle Ages. A study of several medieval sources aims to explain the mentality of <b>the</b> <b>ordeals</b> and to determine the problems’ impact on the functionality of <b>the</b> <b>ordeals.</b> <b>The</b> outcome of <b>the</b> <b>ordeals</b> was not always as simple as you might think. The execution {{and the result of}} <b>the</b> <b>ordeals</b> could be bent. This resulted in manipulation of the ritual and the outcome. A comparison of the analytical results with diverse scientific works carries a varied picture of <b>the</b> praxis of <b>ordeals.</b> These works suggest varying explanations of the purpose of the ordeal: It is seen as an instrument of establishing consensus, a protection of laypeople from the secular law, a way of increasing the authority of the church and as an instrument of political pressure in conflicts. These numerous affecting elements encompass several assorted circumstances and cause complexity to the suggestion of why <b>the</b> praxis of <b>ordeal</b> persisted...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo <b>the</b> <b>ordeal,</b> the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), <b>the</b> <b>ordeal</b> required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the early}} pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus Washstand, the Zodiac Settle and the Great Bookcase, were {{originally}} made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House.
