25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying {{asset to the}} buyer, or, {{if it is a}} cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.|$|E

25|$|In a December {{game against}} the Seattle Seahawks, Testaverde was {{involved}} in a play that was cited as an impetus for the NFL's adoption of a new instant replay review system the next season. With the Jets trailing 31-26 and twenty seconds left in the game, Testaverde attempted to score on a quarterback sneak on fourth and goal from the Seattle five-yard line. Testaverde had been tackled and the ball was not across the goal line when this happened, but because Testaverde's helmet had crossed the line the game's head linesman, Earnie Frantz, ruled the play a touchdown. The Jets won the game 32-31 and the loss was said to have cost the Seahawks a playoff berth and coach Dennis Erickson his job. The game's referee, Phil Luckett, drew criticism for the call although he was not <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} award, {{which was}} valued at C$20,000, Loder was given a {{membership}} for both the East Coast Music and MusicNL trade associations, and was given time at a recording studio and advice from music industry and production professionals. She was also engaged in a featured performance slot at the following year's YC Newfoundland. Loder later referred to the music professionals she met (including Scott Mansfield, Mark Peddle, and NewManiac Studios' Peter Newman) as [...] "the top players" [...] {{in the music industry}} of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the producers helped Loder with Imperfections & Directions, her second album. She was particularly appreciative of Newman, who produced the album, mixing Imperfections & Directions with Tom Laune in Nashville, Tennessee.

500|$|Saint-Just {{saved his}} dignity at the lectern {{but not his}} life. Rising in his support, Robespierre {{sputtered}} and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried to sway the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just, still on the platform, remained unmoved and [...] "looked on contemptuously" [...] at the scene. His confidence seemed validated when troops from the Paris Commune under Hanriot arrived to liberate them, but within hours the entire group was confined to the Hôtel de Ville. When soldiers finally broke inside, {{a number of the}} defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide; Saint-Just stood beside Lebas who shot himself in the head. Any contemplation of his own suicide is unclear, but he alone emerged unruffled from the wild, violent final arrest – among the captured, [...] "only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk." [...] Robespierre, Saint-Just and twenty of their allies were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride. At a last formality of identification, he gestured to a copy of the Constitution of 1793 and said, [...] "I am <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Matthew 19:3, Jesus {{is asked}} [...] "Is it lawful {{for a man}} to divorce his wife for any cause?"

[...] The orange paint on him was orange grease paint fixed with hairspray, which took several weeks to remove after filming. Geeves himself was scared of hitting the finally chosen actor {{in the role of the}} Tango drinker too hard, though the actor did not mind, telling him a hard hit would [...] "make it look real".|$|E

Then it was that Captain George Kendall declared my master must be kept a close prisoner until the matter could be disposed of, and all the others, save Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, agreeing, heavy irons were put upon him.

60|$|Jonathan's {{experienced}} eye {{saw that}} this imprint {{was not an}} hour old. He gazed up at the light. The day was growing short. Already shadows lay in the glens. He would not long have light enough to follow the trail; but he hurried on hoping to find the person who made it before darkness came. He had not traveled many paces before learning that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it was lost. The uncertainty in those hasty steps was as plain to the borderman's eyes, {{as if it had}} been written in words on the sand. The course led along the brook, avoiding the rough places; and leading into the open glades and glens; but it drew no nearer to the settlement. A quarter of an hour of rapid trailing enabled Jonathan to discern a dark figure moving among the trees. Abandoning the trail, he cut across a ridge to head off the lost woman. Stepping out of a sassafras thicket, he came face to face with Helen Sheppard.|$|E
60|$|Then she hid {{her face}} on her bed, covered herself {{to shut out}} the light, and lay there, broken-hearted. What had been that other thing she had {{imagined}} was shame--that shrinking and burning she had suffered through Kells and his men? What was that compared to this awful thing? A brand of red-hot pitch, blacker and bitterer than death, had been struck brutally across her soul. By the man she loved--whom she would have died to save! Jim Cleve had seen in her only an abandoned creature of the camps. His sad and bitter smile had been for the thought {{that he could have}} loved anything of her sex. His scorn had been for the betrayed youth and womanhood suggested by her appearance. And then the thing that struck into Joan's heart was the fact that her grace and charm of person, revealed by this costume forced upon her, had aroused Jim Cleve's first response to the evil surrounding him, the first call to that baseness he must be assimilating from these border ruffians. That he could look at her so! The girl he had loved! Joan's agony lay not in the circumstance of his being as mistaken in her character as he had been in her identity, but that she, of all women, had to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> him answer, like Kells and Gulden and all those ruffians, to the instincts of a beast.|$|E
