A data set from the operational Time Series Station Spiekeroog located at a tidal inlet of the Wadden Sea was used to perform (i) an inter-comparison of observations related to water transparency, (ii) correlation tests among these measured parameters, and (iii) to explore the utility of both acoustic and optical tools in monitoring water transparency. An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler was used to derive the backscatter signal in the water column. Optical observations were collected using above-water hyperspectral radiometers and a submerged turbidity metre. Bio-fouling on the <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensors</b> optical windows resulted in measurement drift and abnormal values during quality control steps. We observed significant correlations between turbidity collected by the submerged metre and that derived from above-water radiometer observations. <b>Turbidity</b> from these <b>sensors</b> was also associated with the backscatter signal derived from the acoustic measurements.

For two sites within the Paris combined sewer system, continuous turbidity, conductivity and flow data were recorded at one-minute time intervals over a one-year period. This paper is intended to highlight the variability in turbidity dynamics during wet weather. For each storm event, turbidity response aspects were analysed through different classifications. The correlation between classification and common parameters, such as the antecedent dry weather period, total event volume per impervious hectare and both the mean and maximum hydraulic flow for each event, was also studied. Moreover, the dynamics of flow and turbidity signals were compared at the event scale. No simple relation between turbidity responses, hydraulic flow dynamics and the chosen parameters was derived from this effort.

40|$|Abstract: Optical <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensors,</b> transmissometers, and {{acoustic}} backscatter sensors {{have been}} well entrenched in the monitoring of suspended sediments. However, results published recently by (Sutherland, et al. 2000) note the two difficulties with turbidity sensors: the calibration changes with grain size changes, and with particle color. Similarly, (Davies-Colley & Smith, 2001) noted that transmissometers also change calibration with grain size, and have upper size cut-offs, (Voss, 1993). Acoustics usually operate at frequencies where a/λ << 1, (a is grain radius and λ is acoustic wavelength) where scattering varies as ∫a 6 da, again not suitable for a mixture of grain sizes.

Continuous TSS time series were derived from online turbidity measurements and were used to estimate event loads and event mean concentrations.

However, definitive results published recently by (Sutherland, 2000) note the two difficulties with turbidity sensors: the calibration is changed whenever grain size changes, and further, calibration also changes significantly with particle color. Similarly, a survey by (Davies-Colley, 2001) notes that transmissometers also change calibration with grain size, and have upper size cut-offs, (Voss, 1993). These results confirm what is expected from Mie’s classic theory of light scattering by spheres. Acoustics usually operate at frequencies where a/λ << 1, (a is grain radius and λ is acoustic wavelength) where scattering varies as volume-squared, again not suitable for a mixture of grain sizes.

In order to characterize sedimentary activity at the shelf break, several interface and piston cores were taken in the Bourcart canyon head and a current meter equipped with temperature, conductivity, pressure and <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensors</b> was moored during the 2003 – 2004 winter season. Even if the canyon is not connected directly to continental sources since Last Glacial Maximum, detailed grain size, X-ray and sediment facies analysis of interface cores show that down to 350 m water depth, the canyon head is blanketed by up to 1. 5 m of structureless muddy medium-grained sand. 210 Pbexc activity measurements demonstrate present day sedimentary activity of the canyon head. Time series of currents with peak velocity reaching 0. 37 m/s, suspended sediment concentration and temperature indicate that dense water cascading is the main process allowing the reworking, transport and accumulation of sand within the canyon head, even though winter 2003 – 2004 was characterized by low cascading events compared to other years. These sand beds, called “cascadite” constitute a new type of deposit that differs from other typical slope deposits (turbidites, hyperpycnites, contourites) in terms of flow duration and sedimentological characteristics.

40|$|Abstract Defining best {{management}} practices for forests requires quantification of the variability of stream sediment loads for managed and unmanaged forest conditions and their associated sediment sources. Although “best {{management practices}} ” are used, the public has concerns about effects from forest restoration activities and commercial timber harvests. It is necessary to know the current and/or natural range of variability {{to be able to}} determine if management activity has a significant negative impact; only long-term research can provide such data. The Forest Service in the United States has such long-term watershed research. An annual sediment load from a watershed is determined by emptying a sediment basin located in the stream channel {{at the end of a}} water year. Sediment fences, stream bank pins, survey techniques, and <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensors</b> provide measurements that can be used to determine the sources of sediment. The importance of having an undisturbed watershed for “natural range of variability ” to compare with watersheds previously or currently under active management is illustrated. For example, at the Kings River Experimental Watersheds one of the managed watersheds in the rain and snow zone, produced 1. 8, 15. 2, and 18. 7 kg/ha for water years 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Determining {{the amount}} of {{sediment}} being transported by rivers is fundamental to determine the environmental impact on reservoirs, {{as well as to}} estimate their life span. This monitoring is particularly important for large hydroelectric dams such as the Itaipu hydroelectric facility on the Paraná River, which provides over 24 % of the electricity needs for Brazil. A system was developed to continuously monitor sediment transport in the main rivers of the watershed acting on this reservoir using specifically developed turbidity sensors, commercial water level meters, manual sediment sampling, and laboratory analyses. The <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensor</b> was designed using a single optical sensor chip and light source LED that works with a single 9 V battery, which can last over 4 months of continuous hourly monitoring. An economical commercial data logger was used to trigger readings and store the sensor response. This data, together with laboratory analyses of sediment samples were used to constantly calibrate sensor readings and determine sediment concentrations in the rivers. Total suspended loads were calculated using river water flow rates as determined by the water level meters and velocity profile measurements. Furthermore, two types of structures were developed to house the sensors in the rivers: 1) buoys and 2) structures fixed to the pillars of bridges. Although both structures protected the sensors well during extreme flow conditions, the buoys required less maintenance because of their constant movement, which limited fouling of optical sensors. Comparisons of laboratory analyses showed good correlation between <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensor</b> readings and manual sediment sampling. This system enabled an economical and continuous monitoring of suspended sediment load for a variety of river conditions. The monitoring results were used to determine total sediment contribution to reservoirs...|$|E

The Tisler reef is situated {{on top of a}} southeast-northwest-oriented sill forming the connection between the Kosterfjord and the open Skagerrak. In spring 2006, two benthic landers equipped with sediment traps, current meters, and <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensors</b> were deployed at the northwest and southeast edges of Tisler reef. The unidirectional northwest currents during the deployment enabled comparison of the quality of particles before and after crossing the reef. Before the onset of the 2006 spring bloom, particles trapped at the northwest reef edge had a more degraded character than those at the southeast edge. When the spring bloom swamped the study area with fresh phytoplankton, cross-reef distinctions in particle quality disappeared. In spring 2007, near-bottom suspended particles were collected with submersible pumps during one part of a tidal cycle. Analysis revealed a difference in composition of suspended particulate matter along the reef, with highest quality at the northwest edge where particles were delivered, and lower quality at the middle and southeast edge of the reef. Results from both cruises show that particles passing over Tisler reef are subject to preferential removal of nitrogen, indicating that even a relatively small reef such as Tisler has an impact on the biochemistry of its environment.

40|$|This paper explores {{changes in}} {{suspended}} sediment transport and fine sediment storage at the reach and patch scale {{associated with the}} reintroduction of partial LW jams in an artificially over-widened lowland river. The field site incorporates two adjacent reaches: a downstream section where LW jams were reintroduced in 2010 and a reach immediately upstream where no LW was introduced. LW pieces were organised into ‘partial’ jams incorporating several ‘key pieces’ which were later colonised by substantial stands of aquatic and wetland plants. Reach-scale suspended sediment transport was investigated using arrays of time-integrated suspended sediment samplers. Patch-scale suspended sediment transport was explored experimentally using <b>turbidity</b> <b>sensors</b> to track the magnitude and velocity of artificially generated sediment plumes. Fine sediment storage was quantified at both reach and patch scales by repeat surveys of fine sediment depth. The results show that partial LW jams influence fine sediment dynamics at both the patch and reach scale. At the patch-scale, introduction of LW led {{to a reduction in}} the concentration and increase in the time lag of released sediment plumes within the LW, indicating increased diffusion of plumes. This contrasted with higher concentrations and lower time lags in areas adjacent to the LW; indicating more effective advection processes. This led to increased fine sediment storage within the LW compared with areas adjacent to the LW. At the reach-scale there was a greater increase in fine sediment storage through time within the restored reach relative to the unrestored reach, although the changes in sediment transport responsible for this were not evident from time-integrated suspended sediment data. The results of the study have been used to develop a conceptual model which may inform restoration design...|$|R

Thanks to this in situ sensor, it is possible to continuously record the turbidity spectrum of a suspension. Particle size distributions can be calculated for grain diameters between 0. 2 and 10 mu m. This sizing technique is applied here to the fragmentation of potassium sulphate in ethanol and in its aqueous solution. A qualitative and quantitative study of the phenomenon of fragmentation can be thus performed. Determination of the influence of mass and stirring rate gives an indication of the prevailing fragmentation mechanisms. The large discrepancies observed between the behaviors in ethanol and in water are due to agglomeration...|$|R
