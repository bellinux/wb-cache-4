5|$|It is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, and uses a chord progression of C–B–Am7–G, that is also used during the verses and <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> In the first verse, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton, and Beckham sing each one line. The chords change to Dm11–Dm9–Dm11–Dm9–Dm7–Em7–F major7–G during the pre-chorus, followed by <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> The same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, {{the first part of the}} second verse consists on the repeated use of the words do and ba da, then Bunton and Chisholm sing the rest of the verse. The group then sing the bridge, and end the song repeating <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> twice. The song uses the verse melody of When You Were Mine (Prince song) with slightly altered phrasing.|$|E

5|$|The novella {{is divided}} into 29 {{chapters}} with introduction, notes, and acknowledgments sections. Structured similarly to a classical Greek drama, the storytelling alternates between Penelope's narrative and the choral commentary of the twelve maids. Penelope narrates 18 chapters with <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book. <b>The</b> <b>Chorus</b> uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters, beginning with a jump-rope rhyme and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other narrative styles used by <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> include a lament, a folk song, an idyll, a sea shanty, a ballad, a drama, an anthropology lecture, a court trial, and a love song.|$|E
5|$|The song {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} {{consisting of a}} sustained measure of electronic effects followed by two lines from <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> In each two-measure line {{during the first half}} of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the off-beats of the first measure and the electric bass opens the line with a two-note bassline. During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are overdubbed, and the instrumentation becomes more frequent. Each of the two verses is followed by <b>the</b> <b>chorus,</b> where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce first inversion and normal form E minor chords. Bounty Killer then toasts the bridge, and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> twice.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{begins with}} the main melody played by Jay K Mulungi on an {{acoustic}} guitar. Timothy Kirya sings the first verse and all <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> while Jay K.

50|$|With the {{departure}} of Steven Page in early 2009, Kevin Hearn has taken over singing Page's lead vocals on almost all of <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> (during <b>the</b> first few performances of this song without Steven, all of <b>the</b> three <b>choruses</b> were sung by Ed Robertson, until Hearn took over performing the first two of them about a year later, in 2010). Often, Kevin sings <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> together with drummer Tyler Stewart, who also performs Steven's harmonies during the bridge. Both <b>the</b> third, last <b>chorus</b> and <b>the</b> following, ending part of the song are sung by Robertson, along with Stewart's harmonizing.|$|R
50|$|Kerouac {{began writing}} <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> that became Mexico City Blues while living with Bill Garver, a heroin addict {{and friend of}} William S. Burroughs, in Mexico City in 1955. Written under the {{influence}} of marijuana and morphine, choruses were defined only by the size of Kerouac's notebook page. Three of <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> (52, 53 and 54) are transcriptions of Garver's speech, while others sought to transcribe sounds, and others Kerouac's own thoughts. <b>The</b> <b>choruses</b> include references to real figures including Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as religious figures and themes. After finishing Mexico City Blues, while still in Mexico City, Kerouac wrote Tristessa.|$|R
5|$|After the fugato episode, the ritornello resumes {{for a third}} time, with <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> {{singing a}} variant of their {{homophonic}} material {{with much of the}} counterpoint inverted; this time, however, there is no fugal episode inserted before the final two bar cadence.|$|E
5|$|Ally then sings as {{she lays}} in the sand, moving sensually as an {{attractive}} man {{comes out of}} the water towards her. The camera fades to Lauren, who sings the bridge as she stands next to a background of rocks, as a take of another man is shown. The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she sings <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> Normani shares <b>the</b> <b>chorus,</b> as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively lays down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally. Several men approach the girls as they arrive in a convertible Jeep Wrangler. They greet and socialize with each other.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern in <b>the</b> <b>chorus,</b> where for two bars the drums play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for {{the climax of the}} vocal line. A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E

5|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third chorus, and its instrumentation {{comes from a}} guitar, brass and string instruments. It starts with an instrumental introduction, with a chord progression of A–Faug–Dmaj7–G7 that is also used during {{the first part of}} the verses and <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> Brown and Bunton sing the first lines of the first verse; the progression then changes to Bm7–E–Dmaj7–C♯7 during the last part of the verse, which is sung by Chisholm. After <b>the</b> <b>chorus,</b> the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Halliwell, Beckham, and Chisholm singing the second verse. The progression changes to Bm7–C♯m7–Gmaj9–F♯7(♯9) as Chisholm sings the bridge, while the rest of the group adds the high harmony. The group sing <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> twice, and repeats the ad-lib as the song fades out.
