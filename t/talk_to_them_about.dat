During papal audiences, he would gather children around him and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons {{in the courtyard of}} San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Senate finally {{ratified}} the Treaty of Payne's Landing in April 1834. The treaty {{had given the}} Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson {{that they had no}} intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, [...] "the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead." [...] General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from President Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, [...] "Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force." [...] The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move {{until the end of the}} year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.|$|E
2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E

It is very seldom he comes in to this sort of thing, but I seized him the other day and told him that I could see he would break down if he didn't give himself a holiday, and I fairly worried him into saying he would come over and stay for the races.

There was no depth to which, in her noble enthusiasm, she would not have gone down. And behold, it had been utterly in vain! Ah! the bitter disappointment of finding her influence fail her utterly, the first time that it was required for a great practical work! They would let her <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their souls, then!--They would even amend a few sins here and there, of which they had been all along as well aware as she. But to be convinced of a new sin; to have their laziness, pride, covetousness, touched; that, she found, was what they would not bear; and where she had expected, if not thanks, at least a fair hearing, she had been met with peevishness, ridicule, even anger and insult.|$|E

I remember a thoughtful man once remarking during argument that if he believed in ghosts--the silly, childish spooks about which we had been telling anecdotes--death would possess for him an added fear: the idea that his next dwelling-place would be among such a pack of dismal idiots would sadden his departing hours. What was he to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about?</b> Apparently their only interest lay in recalling their earthly troubles. The ghost of the lady unhappily married who had been poisoned, or had her throat cut, who every night for the last five hundred years had visited the chamber where it happened for no other purpose than to scream about it! what a tiresome person she would be to meet! All her conversation during the long days would be around her earthly wrongs. The other ghosts, in all probability, would have heard about that husband of hers, what he said, and what he did, till they were sick of the subject. A newcomer would be seized upon with avidity.|$|E
