5000|$|Travel is {{the measure}} of {{distance}} {{from the bottom of}} the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle is on a jack and the wheel hangs freely) to the top of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle's wheel can no longer travel in an upward direction toward the vehicle). Bottoming or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems or directly cause damage. [...] "Bottoming" [...] can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. The control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See Triumph TR3B.) Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps called [...] "limiting straps" [...] to limit the suspensions downward travel to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers. This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force when the suspension reaches [...] "full droop", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their [...] "buckets" [...] if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often nylon of a predetermined length, that stops the downward movement at a preset point before the theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the [...] "bump-stop", which protects the suspension and vehicle (as well as the occupants) from violent [...] "bottoming" [...] of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or hard landing) causes the suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that [...] "bottoms out" [...] will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber [...] "nubs" [...] to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, may be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampeners) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location such that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward <b>travel</b> <b>limit.</b> These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential because a rubber bump-stop is considered a [...] "last-ditch" [...] emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottomings such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear control method for dual-stage actuator (DSA) systems to track a step command input fast and accurately. Conventional tracking controllers for DSA systems were generally designed {{to enable the}} primary actuator to approach the setpoint without overshoot. However, we observe that this strategy is unable to achieve the minimal settling time when the setpoints are beyond the secondary actuator <b>travel</b> <b>limit.</b> To further reduce the settling time, we design the primary actuator controller to yield a closedloop system with a small damping ratio for a fast rise time and certain allowable overshoot. Then, a composite nonlinear control law is designed for the secondary actuator to reduce the overshoot caused by the primary actuator as the system output approaches the setpoint. The proposed control method was applied to an actual DSA positioning system, which consists of a linear motor and a piezo actuator. Experimental results demonstrate that it can further reduce the settling time significantly compared with the conventional control...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} present {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} wider spatial-economic impacts of High Speed Trains (HSTs) at the intra-regional level. It represents follow-up research to a previous empirical study at inter-regional level, based on UKIC 125 - an upgraded HST system. The findings suggest that HST has had substantial and demonstrable effects in aiding this transition within a 2 -hour <b>travel</b> <b>limit</b> of London, but that the effects have not been automatic or universal. The need for integrated planning combining transport, economic, and spatial issues to promote dynamic city-region development should not be overlooked. Particularly, the UK is currently situated at the critical turning point considering a long-term commitment to High Speed Two (HS 2) : whether, to what extent, and how {{the arrival of a}} HST hub in a city could act as the agent of change for transforming surrounding sub-regions. Thus, a finer-grained and deeper-probing analysis at the intra-regional scale is needed, in the form of comparative case studies of two post-industrial city-regions. Lille/Pas-de-Calais and the Manchester city-region are chosen, the first {{to examine the effects of}} the TGV after its arrival in 1994, the second to provide a prognosis for Manchester and its neighbouring towns after the projected arrival of HS 2. In the Lille M 9 tropole, the TGV brought about a dramatic change in economic fortunes. But, within the wider Nord-Pas de Calais region, two divergent developmental trajectories of traditional manufacturing industries have increasingly manifested themselves: Lille M 9 tropole has increasingly strengthened its service-based growth, whereas the former coal area and coastal region seems not to have attracted knowledge-based development. In the Manchester city-region, the new generation of 300 k/hr HST lines will undoubtedly in their turn have major spatial-economic impacts as Manchester is brought closer to London with the dramatic shrinking of critical time-distance. The relationship between Manchester and its neighbouring towns may however be negative to poorly connected towns like Burnley which is reflected in its weak economic performance. Overall, this research aims to fill in the gap with empirical evidence of intra-regional impacts of HSTs and disentangle the complex forces and the developmental phases in the dynamic process of city-region regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Turfgrass {{water use}} (seasonal turfET) and crop {{coefficients}} were determined and a mathematical soil-water balance model for non-weighing drainage lysimeters, which simulates the occurrence (timing and amount) of drainage, was developed. Pairs of non-weighing drainage lysimeters {{were used to}} determine crop coefficients for turfgrass in four locations in the state of Utah: Logan Golf and Country Club, Murray Golf Course, Brigham Young University (Spanish Fork) Experiment Farm, and Sunbrook Golf Course (St. George). Daily weather data including air temperature, relative humidity, average wind travel, total solar radiation, precipitation, and average soil temperature were collected with an electronic weather station at each site. Daily precipitation was measured in three sites throughout the season: Murray, Spanish Fork, and Sunbrook. At Logan Golf and Country Club, precipitation was measured to November 10, 2002. Water use (averages of two lysimeters) during the growing season varied from 684 to 732 mm for three years (2000 - 2002) for the mid-April through late-October observation period at Logan Golf Course; 699 mm for May through October at Murray; 469 mm at Spanish Fork; and 896 mm for late-February through early November at Sunbrook, for 2002 growing season. Calculated seasonal Etr using the 82 Kimberly Penman equation with a 1 00 -miles-per-day wind <b>travel</b> <b>limit</b> varied from 1166 to 1229 mm at Logan Golf and Country Club, 1067 mm at Murray, 839 mm at Spanish Fork, and 1574 mm at Sunbrook. Seasonal Etr calculated using the PM ASCE std Etr equation was greater than the 82 Kimberly Peru 11 an. Seasonal Eto calculated using the FAO# 56 Eto equation was less than both the 82 Kimberly Penman and the PM ASCE std Etr equations. Calculated crop coefficients (as a ratio of measured crop water use and calculated potential evapotranspiration) based on alfalfa reference evapotranspiration with the 1982 Kimberly-Penman equation averaged 0. 58 for the three years at Logan. Seasonal averages varied from 0. 57 to 0. 60. Seasonal crop coefficients (2002) were 0. 57 for Logan, Spanish Fork, and Sunbrook, and 0. 65 for Murray. Short-period crop coefficients also varied within a given season. Short-term crop coefficients derived from a time of wetting and drainage experiment averaged 0. 55 at Logan, 0. 56 at Murray, 0. 60 at Spanish Fork, and 0. 56 at Sunbrook...|$|E
40|$|Suspension {{system design}} is a {{challenging}} task with multiple control parameters, complex (often conflicting) objectives and stochastic disturbances. It {{is essential to}} develop a design environment, {{in the form of}} a mathematical model, which will help engineering efforts, not only in algorithm design but also in the investigation of various research questions. This paper examines issues relevant to semi-active suspension control system design optimization. It also presents a numerical approach for such optimization. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are applied to the optimization of the control system parameters. EAs are computer-based techniques that mirror natural genetic evolution, and they have been found to be successful in application to a wide range of problems that are difficult to solve analytically. The algorithms use randomly chosen road surfaces as input to a quarter-car computer model and develop the design of a number of non-linear, semi-active suspension control systems. These are then compared using a fitness function as a measure. For a suspension system the goal of ride comfort conflicts with the restriction of staying within the limits of suspension travel, or rattle space (the distance between the car body and the tyre which is restricted to the suspension <b>travel</b> <b>limit).</b> Thus the EAs examined in this paper use a multiobjective fitness function which is a weighted sum of car body rate-of-change of acceleration and suspension travel. Two separate fitness measures are analysed and developed, and are combined in a weighted sum. Various different weights are used and the effect of the weighting is analysed. An EA was applied to the development of a semiactive suspension system using a computer simulation model. The modelled control system uses sensor measurements of car-body acceleration and suspension travel to provide indicators that will allow an EA to determine the best mix of strategies. The goal is to simultaneously maintain the suspension travel within the rattle space and to minimize car-body rate-of-change of acceleration. A number of car-suspension control algorithms mentioned in the literature are analysed using an EA, such as passive and skyhook controls (Gordon and Best, 1994; Savaresi et al., 2003; Caponetto et al., 2003; Jalili, 2002) as well as the "on-off skyhook control policy" (Caponetto et al., 2003; Jalili, 2002). Some minor variations on these designs are also analysed. The parameters developed in the EAs are compared and the corresponding fitness functions are also compared. The results are given below, indicating strengths and weakness of the various control strategies using the components of the fitness measure. The results are developed for verification and validation purposes. These indicated that the passive system was quite robust and that adapting the skyhook system to a semiactive system was counter productive for comfort and for keeping the suspension within the rattle space. It is also clear that genes covering more factors in combination are needed for a deeper investigation using this technique, and that it is necessary to go beyond the skyhook control. Experiments using a combination of factors, and using member-set functions, are currently being planned. Further work will use Pareto optimums. Pareto optimum measures compare fitness using a number of separate objectives simultaneously, and the various objectives can be compared independently. Experiments are being planned to investigate real road surfaces, especially the frequency profile of road noise. The simulation test bed is being extended to include active suspensions as well as more degrees of freedom...|$|E
