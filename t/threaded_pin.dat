The current article presents a complete experimental study on the performance of various <b>thread</b> <b>pinning</b> strategies. We investigate four application independent <b>thread</b> <b>pinning</b> strategies and five application sensitive ones based on cache sharing. We made extensive performance evaluation on three different multi-core machines reflecting three usual utilisation: workstation machine, server machine and high performance machine. In overall, we show that fixing thread affinities (whatever the tested strategy) is a better choice for improving program performance on HPC ccNUMA machines compared to OS-based thread placement. This means that the current Linux OS scheduling strategy is not necessarily the best choice in terms of performance on ccNUMA machines, even if it is a good choice in terms of cores usage ratio and work balancing.

30|$|In this investigation, the defect-free joints were {{achieved}} while using THC and TTC pin profiled tools in both {{air and water}} cooling medium. During each rotation of the tool, the threaded profile extrudes cylindrical sheets of material around the tool pin from AS to RS and from RS to AS. The peaks and valleys of <b>threaded</b> <b>pin</b> profile offer more friction over the plasticized material which promotes sticking condition. Thus, the extent of heat generation and plasticization is sufficient to attain the balance state of heat and material flow. In general, the defect is formed in the weld periphery, i.e. the transformed layers around the tool pin. So, the pin profile should capable of forming sufficient transforming layers.

40|$|This thesis report investigates how the {{parameters}} of friction stir welding tools {{affect the quality of}} welds. Specifically, the joining of 5 mm 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy with four different tools was carried out and a relationship between tool parameters and weld quality was then determined. The four types of tools include; a flat shoulder with cylindrical <b>threaded</b> <b>pin,</b> flat shoulder with triangular pin, spiral shoulder with threaded triflute pin and concave shoulder with <b>threaded</b> <b>pin.</b> The design of the friction stir welding tools are based on literature reviewed. To analyse the quality of the welds microstructure, bend and hardness tests were conducted. The experimental setup consists of a milling machine with an adjustable spindle speed and transverse feed rate which was used to undertake friction stir welding. The welding parameters of spindle speed and transverse feed rate were kept constant throughout testing which allows only the tool geometry to affect the outcome of the welds. Welds made with the triflute, cylindrical and concave tools were of a satisfactory condition whereas the triangular tool failed. Results from post weld analysis indicate that the triflute and concave tools have a coarse grain microstructure which leads to a lower hardness and a more ductile failure during the bend test. The cylindrical tool resulted in a fine grained microstructure and thus has a higher hardness and brittle failure. The triangular tool failed to produce a satisfactory weld due to failure in the pin which sheared off. Micro crack defects were found in all weld samples as well as a wormhole in welds made using the cylindrical tool and lack of root penetration with the triflute tool...|$|E
40|$|Computer aided joint {{replacement}} surgery {{has become}} very popular during recent years and is being done in increasing numbers all over the world. The accuracy of the system depends to a major extent, on accurate registration and immobility of the tracker attachment devices to the bone. This {{study was designed to}} asses the forces needed to displace the tracker attachment devices in the bone simulators. Bone simulators were used to maintain the uniformity of the bone structure during the study. The fixation devices tested were 3 mm diameter self drilling, self tapping <b>threaded</b> <b>pin,</b> 4 mm diameter self tapping cortical <b>threaded</b> <b>pin,</b> 5 mm diameter self tapping cancellous <b>threaded</b> <b>pin</b> and a triplanar fixation device ‘ortholock’ used with three 3 mm pins. All the devices were tested for pull out, translational and rotational forces in unicortical and bicortical fixation modes. Also tested was the normal bang strength and forces generated by leaning on the devices. The forces required to produce translation increased with the increasing diameter of the pins. These were 105 N, 185 N, and 225 N for the unicortical fixations and 130 N, 200 N, 225 N for the bicortical fixations for 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins respectively. The forces required to pull out the pins were 1475 N, 1650 N, 2050 N for the unicortical, 1020 N, 3044 N and 3042 N for the bicortical fixated 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins. The ortholock translational and pull out strength was tested to 900 N and 920 N respectively and still it did not fail. Rotatory forces required to displace the tracker on pins was to the magnitude of 30 N before failure. The ortholock device had rotational forces applied up to 135 N and still did not fail. The manual leaning forces and the sudden bang forces generated were of the magnitude of 210 N and 150 N respectively. The strength of the fixation pins increases with increasing diameter from three to five mm for the translational forces. There is no significant difference in pull out forces of four mm and five mm diameter pins though it is more that the three mm diameter pins. This is because of the failure of material at that stage rather than the fixation device. The rotatory forces required to displace the tracker are very small and much less that that can be produced by the surgeon or assistants in single pins. Although the ortholock device was tested to 135 N in rotation without failing, one has to be very careful not to put any forces during the operation on the tracker devices to ensure the accuracy of the procedure. ...|$|E
40|$|Acute slip of {{the upper}} femoral {{epiphysis}} is uncommon and differs from the more common chronic slip in its clinical presentation. Fahey and O’Brien (1965) defined an acute slip as “characterised by onset of severe pain {{less than three weeks}} prior to treatment, [...] . and frequently, inability to bear weight”. Few papers deal specifically with the problem. Although it is recognised that closed reduction is possible in an acute slip, the risks involved, the method ofreduction and the means used to immobilise the epiphysis have not been established. Fahey and O’Brien (1965) recommended early gentle manipulation under general anaesthesia and maintenance of the reduction by two or three partly <b>threaded</b> <b>pins.</b> Nine of their ten patients were treated in this way. Satisfactory reduction was achieved and good results obtained without evidence of avascular necrosis. Schein (1967) recommended early reduction by skeletal traction with medial rotation, followed by internal fixation with <b>threaded</b> <b>pins</b> at ten days to three weeks. Only one of the eleven patients described was treated by this method, the result being good. Three of the four patients treated by closed manipulation and internal fixation suffered avascular necrosis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} treatment for minimally displaced femoral neck fractures using multiple <b>threaded</b> <b>pins</b> versus sliding compression screws for internal fixation. METHODS: The medical records of 62 consecutive elderly patients with minimally displaced intra-capsular femoral neck fractures who underwent internal fixation of the fracture (37 with multiple <b>threaded</b> <b>pins,</b> and 25 with sliding compression screws) were reviewed. Clinical and radiological assessment of fracture healing at follow-up visits were noted. RESULTS: In the 55 patients seen for follow-up at 3 months, 21. 9 % (n= 7) of those treated by pinning demonstrated non-union of the fracture, and 0 % of fractures treated with sliding compression screws (p= 0. 02). 46 patients were seen for follow-up at one year, with 10 % (n= 2) of those treated with sliding compression screws found to have osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The 2 fractures in the group treated by pinning demonstrating non-union at 3 months failed to unite by one year (p= 0. 11). 34 patients were seen for follow-up for at least 2 years, with no additional complications noted. CONCLUSION: Using sliding compression screws to treat minimally displaced femoral neck fractures can achieve a higher union rate than using pinning. The reason may be the better stability in the osteoporotic bone. However, osteonecrosis of the femoral head may occur with use of sliding compression screws because of greater intramedullary vascular damage {{as a result of}} wider reaming...|$|R
