40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were 1) to analyze the customer expectations and customer perceptions for each attribute service at taximeter <b>testing</b> <b>installation,</b> Balai Metrologi DKI Jakarta 2) to analyze level of customer satisfaction toward taximeter testing service, and 3) to analyze the attributes which could be increased customer satisfaction in taximeter <b>testing</b> <b>installation.</b> The simple random sampling is used to collected 100 respondents that came to calibrate of taximeter in taximeter <b>testing</b> <b>installation</b> Balai Metrologi DKI Jakarta. Servqual, Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), and Suhardjo diagonal are used to analyze and answer the objectives. The results of the study commonly showed that gap average between expectations-perceptions of the customer do not wide (0. 65). The analysis of Suhardjo diagonal showed that all of attributes let on beneath near diagonal line. It mean that the performance of service is still inefficient. The customer satisfaction level was 84. 07 percent (Gaspersz, 1997) or was – 0. 74 on servqual analysis. The customers feel good enough toward the service at taximeter <b>testing</b> <b>installation</b> on Balai Metrologi DKI Jakarta. However, some attributes at tangible dimension and a attribute at reliability dimension showed a wide gap. Based on Importance-Performance Analysis, those attributes were prime priority categories which means increased them could be improved quality service. The attribute that could be improved customer satisfaction were testing location, testing expense, taximeter service agent, sanitation and pray places, and the officer could be identified...|$|R

2500|$|Wright Air Development Center {{delivered}} a B-47 with Doppler-augmented K-system to the Air Force Armament Center, in July 1955, for tests aimed principally at the MA-6A bombing system. The <b>test</b> <b>installation</b> also contained provisions for automatic crosshair-laying, semi-automatic fix taking, and dead reckoning navigation. The first flight at Eglin on 22 July 1955 {{revealed that the}} Doppler set caused [...] "wander" [...] in the wind values calculated by the D-system, a condition which made the equipment completely unsatisfactory for bombing. General Precision Laboratories {{went to work on}} the APN-81, and Sperry on the computers already modified by International Business Machines, in an attempt to resolve the difficulties. By July 1956, the Doppler tie-in was at last working satisfactorily during test flights.|$|E
2500|$|SFO was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} first <b>test</b> <b>installation</b> of the AMASS ground radar system in 1992. AMASS, which can detect and alert controllers to potential runway conflicts, was intended by the FAA to be eventually installed in 40 airports around the country. However much criticism was directed at the project for cost overruns and lengthy delays. The SFO AMASS was finally declared operational on June 18, 2001. According to AMASS technical support personnel, in a scenario such as this conflict, AMASS {{is designed to provide}} an alert 15seconds before the aircraft reach the conflict point, and the system performed as designed. [...] However, the NTSB has noted that while AMASS alerted in this incident, it did not alert in time to prevent the runway incursion.|$|E

5000|$|The first <b>test</b> <b>installation</b> [...] between Sunbury and Lewistown, PA in 1923 {{used the}} tracks as an {{inductive}} loop coupled to the locomotive’s receiver. The system had two 60 Hz signals. The break-sensing “track” signal was fed down one rail towards the oncoming train and crossed through its wheels, returning {{in the other}} rail. The pickup {{just ahead of the}} wheels would sum the approaching current from one side with the returning current on the other. The externally returned ”loop” signal was fed {{into and out of the}} mid tap of a resistor across each end of the track circuit. The pickup would sum the approaching current on each side as it carried on past to the far end of the track. This signal was shifted 90 degrees from the other. The signals were applied one or both continuously to give Approach or Clear aspects while no signal was a Restricting aspect. The <b>test</b> <b>installation</b> eliminated wayside block signals, and trains relied solely on cab signals.|$|E
