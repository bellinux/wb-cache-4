5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed. Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> {{more than a}} single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|E
5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E

5|$|This {{perspective}} {{was accepted}} within the Fourth International, yet sowed <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> the split in 1953. At the Third World Congress, the sections {{agreed with the}} perspective of an international civil war. The French section disagreed with the associated tactic of entryism sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role {{of the working class}} parties in the Fourth International. The leaders {{of the majority of the}} Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and Pierre Lambert, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the French section.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> further conflict.|$|E
5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E

25|$|This {{catastrophic event}} was {{to lay a}} new {{foundation}} for discontent with an administration already perceived as incompetent and dishonest by many Samoans. The clumsy handling of Samoa's governance, the slow and deliberate erosion of traditional Samoan social structures by successive administrators, and a general failure to understand and respect Samoan culture also sowed <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> a revitalised resistance to colonial rule.

The Newells were then asked to go to Mauritius but Samuel Newell lost his only child and wife in Mauritius. From there he left for British-held Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka.

This {{was followed by the}} opening of a new facility in Chandler, Arizona in 1989 to house the company's expanding rocket business.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 Dr. T.M. Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty {{released}} the Non-Brahmin Manifesto sowing <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>for</b> the Dravidian movements.

The Justice Party was not focused on the Indian independence movement, rather on the local issues such as affirmative action for socially backward groups. The other main movement was the anti-religious, anti-Brahimin reformist movement led by E.V. Ramasami Naicker. Further steps towards eventual self-rule were taken in 1935 when the British Government passed the All-India Federation Act of 1935. Fresh local elections were held and in Tamil Nadu the Congress party captured power defeating the Justice party. In 1938, Ramasami Naicker with C. N. Annadurai launched an agitation against the Congress ministry's decision to introduce the teaching of Hindi in schools.|$|E
