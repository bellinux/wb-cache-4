500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} divided on Aniston's {{performance}} as Claire. TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote that Aniston [...] "looked sweet, but the role was juuuuust a bit much... over-the-top." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste {{said that the}} show did not really seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Aniston in this episode. Tom Stempel for Slant Magazine said 30 Rock was [...] "smart enough" [...] not to make Claire resemble Aniston's former television character, Rachel, from Friends. Further in his review, Stempel said that Claire was a [...] "great choice of character" [...] for Aniston to play, and praised her for knocking the role [...] "out of the park." [...] Kerrie Murphy for The Australian was equally positive noting that Aniston fits in smoothly as Liz's former roommate. Murphy added, [...] "Not only is it a reminder that Aniston is a gifted comic actor [...] With her, the show's regular cast easily hold their own." ...|$|E
500|$|Ayane's {{gameplay}} {{abilities in}} other games were regarded more variably. In the DOA Xtreme and Paradise beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, {{at the cost}} of poor defence, power and speed. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Ayane is [...] "not exactly who you want to spike at the net or try to blow past blocks, but she's excellent at long spikes, digging, and soft dinks." [...] As such, Ayane is most effective as a support, but she should not be paired with Kasumi due to their rivalry; to partner with each other, Ayane and Kasumi need convincing by gift-giving. In Ninja Gaiden Σ 2, Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi combos resemble her combos from Dead or Alive) and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player has to learn to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities. The official guide to this game by Prima's Bryan Dawson states that Ayane's short range and limited attack power [...] "make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission" [...] and [...] "her only saving graces" [...] are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash Kunai projectiles. In addition, if controlled by the console in the co-op mode, the character [...] "doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in any situation." [...] Mitch Dyer of IGN opined that a vastly improved Ayane from Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is [...] "a damn fine addition" [...] to the game, where she is [...] "just as capable as Ryu Hayabusa" [...] with her [...] "quick and vicious" [...] melee attacks and explosive kunai projectiles, adding that she is [...] "functionally similar to Hayabusa in terms of combos and skills, complete with a screen-clearing special move." [...] Similarly, Retro Gamer described her simply as [...] "a nimbler version of Ryu." [...] David Lynch of X360 wrote all the [...] "girls" [...] of Razor's Edge (Ayane, Kasumi and Momiji) became [...] "just as deadly" [...] in it as Ryu Hayabusa has been through the Ninja Gaiden series. In Fatal Frame, unlike the protagonists of the game, Ayane can not permanently defeat ghosts and her strategy relies on evasion.|$|E

2500|$|The Southern Ocean Review {{wrote of}} Jenny Green Teeth: [...] "This is a {{stunning}} book of short stories, for their sheer variety and depth, and also strength of language. … Hayward writes {{with an eye}} to truth and justice and historical accuracy.

[...] The Chaff reviewer wrote of Jenny Green Teeth: [...] "Hayward's eclectic poetry reflects his enigmatic mind. ... His poems are passionate and full of rich images and exert a strong and dignified intelligence. Hayward exerts a courageous strength, rebelling against his past creative constraints, and in perhaps a flush of originality and ambitious flair, has achieved a work of art." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{third time}} Enki succumbs to temptation, and {{attempts}} seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enki's reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, {{upset at the}} promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely {{to be affected by}} flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth Ninhursag takes Enki's semen from Uttu's womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward Isimud, [...] "Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, 'What is this (plant), what is this (plant). His messenger Isimud, answers him; 'My king, this is the tree-plant', he says to him. He cuts it off for him and he (Enki) eats it". And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant (ill with swellings) in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> chagrinned they [...] "sit in the dust". As Enki lacks a womb with which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil King of the Gods, [...] "If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward?" [...] Ninhursag's sacred fox then fetches the goddess.|$|E
2500|$|The character’s birth {{occurred}} in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, {{although in the}} on-screen events, he was born on Boxing Day. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed [...] "Chunky" [...] by actor Adam Woodyatt. According to former EastEnders writer, David Yallop, it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer Mike Gibbon's plan to increase the ratings by culling {{a large number of}} the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, [...] "We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who {{was in the process of}} being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem." [...] He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words [...] "Baby die". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E
