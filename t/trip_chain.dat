This paper {{explores the}} interrelationship between <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> pattern and trip mode choice based on multinomial {{logistic}} model, using 2010 Nanjing resident trip survey data.

Trip mode is great positively associated with <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> pattern of HW+WH, HO+OH, HW+OH, however, in return <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> pattern {{is the most significant}} negative factor that affects trip mode choice, which means that no <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> pattern would provoke travelers to select multi-modes. Despite the results seem to reach a contradiction between <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> pattern and trip mode choice, still two facets of views try to explain the phenomenon, in addition, discussion on the interrelationship between complex <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> pattern and multi-modes which might put forward more challenges to urban planning is also proposed as well in the paper...|$|E

It is found that urban low-income people have lower mobility than the non-low-income. They tend to make fewer trips and of shorter distance. However, average trip duration of the low-income is longer than that of the non-low-income. Results show that the low-income individual makes most of their trips for subsistence activities, such as going to work or school. In addition, large proportions of all trips made by the low-income are undertaken by walking, electric motorcycle, and bicycle.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between mode choice and the complexity of <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> patterns. An understanding of the causality between these two choice behaviors may aid {{in the development of}} tour-based travel demand modeling systems that attempt to incorporate models of <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> and mode choice. The relationship between these two aspects of travel behavior is represented in this thesis by considering three different causal structures: one structure in which the <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> pattern is determined first and influences mode choice, another structure in which mode choice is determined first and influences the complexity of the <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> pattern, and a third structure in which neither is predetermined but both are determined simultaneously. The first two structures are estimated within a recursive bivariate probit modeling framework that accommodates error covariance. The simultaneous logit model is estimated for the third structure that allows a bidirectional simultaneous causality. The analysis and model estimation are performed separately for work tour and non-work tour samples drawn from the 2000 Swiss Microcensus travel survey. Model estimation results show that the causal structure in which <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> precedes mode choice performs best for the non-work tour sample. For the work-tour sample, the findings were less conclusive because two causal structures, one in which <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> affects mode choice and the other in which both are determined simultaneously, gave virtually identical goodness-of-fit measures. But the structure in which mode choice precedes <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> pattern choice gave significantly inferior goodness-of-fit measures for the work tour sample.

40|$|<b>Trip</b> <b>chaining</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} generally known as linking multiple activities and trips in one travel process. A good understanding about <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> complexity is important for travel demand model development and for transportation policy design. However, most of the existing studies on <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> limit the complexity classification scheme on number of <b>trips</b> <b>chained</b> and neglect other dimensions that also elevate the degree of complexity. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a new approach, Tour Complexity Index (TCI), that integrates the multi-dimensional nature of <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> into the complexity assessment. The study contains three analysis components. The first component introduces the TCI approach as a <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> complexity measure that not only considers number of <b>trips</b> <b>chained</b> but also includes the spatial relationship across destinations, the route arrangement, and the urban environment of the destinations. By comparing descriptive statistics and generalized linear model results from TCI approach with those from traditional approach, we find that the TCI approach offers more information regarding <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> and mode choice. The application of TCI is further demonstrated in the following components. The second component investigates the intrapersonal daily and weekly travel variability with travel characterized by TCI and mode choice. The result reinforces an argument in current literature that the common single-day travel survey may produce biased estimation due to the day-to-day variance in travel behavior. Result also finds that proximity to a new transit service from place of residence is connected with a decline in variability. The third component explores a framework for travel pattern recognition where pattern is characterized by TCI as well. The discrepancy analysis which is a generalized analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is applied to associate individual characteristics with travel pattern. In addition, both components use Sequential Alignment Method (SAM) for travel pattern representation. The TCI approach and proposed analysis frameworks are validated using the longitudinal GPS trajectory data collected between 2011 and 2013 at west Los Angeles area for Expo Study...|$|R

However, there are few case studies based on operational data to show the role carsharing systems play in citizens’ daily trips. In this study, vehicle GPS data of a round-trip carsharing system in Hangzhou, China was used to describe the <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> characteristics of users. For clearer delineation of carshare usage, the car use time length of all observations chosen in the study was within 24 h or less.

The pool of observations was then classified into five clusters, with each cluster having significant differences in one or two <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> characteristics. The cluster results reflected that different use patterns exist. By a comparative analysis with trip survey data in Hangzhou, differences in <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> characteristics exist between carsharing and private cars, but in some cases, shared vehicles can be a substitute for private cars to satisfy motorized travel.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> order model for {{simulating}} retailer restocking within urban and metropolitan area. It {{is part of}} the general modelling system developed by the authors for simulating urban freight demand which considers both demand and logistic sub-systems. The former allows us to obtain the freight Origin-Destination (OD) matrices in quantities and deliveries per transport service type, time slice and vehicle type. The latter allows us to obtain the vehicle OD matrices according to the journey characteristics (i. e. number and sequence of delivery points) in order to restock economic activities located within the study area. This approach, known in literature as tour-based approach, aims at reproducing the choice structure of the restocking process and the sequence of delivery points (stops) for vehicle journeys, considering dependences existing among subsequent trips of the same journey. It implies that each destination zone to be delivered is chosen depending on the previous and the next destination ones. The logistic subsystem of the proposed modelling system can be divided in two parts: the first which defines the <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> order (i. e. the number of deliveries made during a tour); the second one which considers the choice of the stop locations.

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{gaining a}} better understanding about time and space related determinants, which are generally acknowledged to be important factors {{in the choice of}} transport mode. The effect of trip chaining is taken into account to improve the insight in the relation between the choice of transport mode and time factors. The data source is the first large scale Belgian mobility survey, carried out in 1998 - 1999, complemented with a newly created database, containing for each trip a calculated public transport trip. This allows comparing for each trip the actual travel time with the calculated travel time by public transport. Using elasticities and regression techniques the relation between travel time components and public transport use is quantified. On trip level, a clear relation is found between waiting and walking time and public transport use. On <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> level, travel time variables for the whole <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> such as the maximum and the range in the travel time ratio provide a significant improvement to the explanatory power of the regression model.
