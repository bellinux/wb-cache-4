[...] This gas is used to drive reciprocating opposing cylinders (in the fourth-generation device) to produce sufficient motion (throw) with sufficient force and frequency to allow flapping-wing flight. As of 2004, the RCM had been demonstrated in the Georgia Tech Research Institute laboratory to achieve sufficient <b>throw,</b> <b>force,</b> and frequency for operation of a 50-gram entomopter while using high concentration (> 90%) hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence}} of a proprietary catalyst developed by ETS Laboratories.|$|E

50|$|Various {{other objects}} {{are often used}} for added showmanship. Tennis rackets, {{throwing}} knives, or lit torches {{may be used in}} place of clubs. Apples or raw eggs are sometimes used in place of balls. (The performer will typically take bites of the apple {{in the middle of the}} act.) Other more extreme examples might include chainsaws, bowling balls, or other heavy or unwieldy objects. These are of course, considerably more dangerous, and usually only used by the most experienced jugglers. Some performers will mix various objects of widely differing weights, sizes, and shapes, requiring them to adjust their <b>throwing</b> <b>force</b> for each object.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{preliminary}} study is to identify signs of fatigue in specific muscle groups that in turn directly influence accuracy in professional darts. Electromyography (EMG) sensors are employed to monitor the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles of the trunk and upper limb during throw. It is noted that the Flexor Pollicis Brevis muscle which controls the critical release action during throw shows signs of fatigue. This is accompanied by an inherent increase in mean integral EMG amplitude {{for a number of}} other throw related muscles indicating an attempt to maintain constant applied <b>throwing</b> <b>force.</b> A strong correlation is shown to exist between average score and decrease in mean integral ECG amplitude for the Flexor Pollicis Brevis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel embedded digital throwing system for synchronously sensing the <b>throwing</b> <b>force</b> of shot-put athletes in real time. The three axes integrated accelerometer, {{as a crucial}} device in the force sensing system, can acquire the kinetics data along three orthogonal directions with reasonably high accuracy. The digital shot with almost {{the same size and}} weight as the standard shot for open female has been designed, fabricated and implemented. The mechanical structure, signal processing system, and human-machine interface are illuminated in detail. In this manner, the force sensing system serves as a powerful tool for coaches and sports scientists to make scientific researches on professional throwing techniques. It also provides an intuitive and reliable guidance for the throwing athletes to improve their skills. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} speed up the defects of the neural network {{computing}} and recognition, the essay proposes the information identification method research of sports <b>throwing</b> <b>force</b> based on the fuzzy neural network model. Firstly, I use the information, which is the combination of the wavelet transformation and the fuzzy neural network, to identify the new method combining and make the noise-suppressed processing of information. Then, according to the athlete’s throwing action and the extraction of signal processing characteristics, as well as the analysis of the fuzzy neural network algorithm. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, I make analysis for the experimental results, which indicates that using this algorithm can not only have less noise than the traditional algorithm, but also have less number of the neural network computation. Besides, its recognition speed and accuracy is also higher...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel digital-shot system for sensing the <b>throwing</b> <b>force</b> {{information}} of shot-put athletes in real time. The digital-shot {{has been designed}} and manufactured with the same external dimensions and weight as the normal shot for open females. The three axes integrated accelerometer, as a crucial device in the force sensing system, can acquire the kinetics data along three orthogonal directions with reasonably high accuracy. By using the method of wavelet transformation, the characteristics of acceleration signals during the shot-put period can be extracted. Artificial neural network is adopted to recognise the movement pattern in different phases of shot throwing. For supplying more effective training instruction, {{with the help of}} six axes ground reaction force measuring apparatus, high-speed photography and surface electromyographic signal remote measuring device etc, an integrated platform of shot-put athlete biomechanical information acquisition is constructed. Based on the fusion of multi-targets and multi-parameters information, the shot-put athletes coaching system is proposed, which not only can supply constructive guidance for athletes to improve their skills, but also provide a new research platform of motion human modeling...|$|R
50|$|USC {{advanced}} to the 16-team NCAA Tournament and began tournament play in Corvallis, where the Trojans defeated Idaho State in the first round, 73-59. In the second-round game, the Trojans faced the Santa Clara Broncos, a team that had played in three consecutive NCAA Tournaments. The game was closely contested throughout, with 13 lead changes and eight ties. The third quarter saw a forward surge from the Trojans, which the Broncos matched as the quarter closed. Santa Clara entered the final 40 seconds of a low-scoring fourth quarter with a three-point lead. USCs Irvin was fouled as he scored on a lay-in, and his made free throw tied the game at 57-57. The score remained tied {{at the end of}} the regulation period. In the final minute of the overtime period, the Trojans again trailed by three points. Welsh scored to bring the Trojans within one point of Santa Clara. Guard Tony Psaltis then tied the score at 65-65 with a free <b>throw,</b> <b>forcing</b> a second overtime period.|$|R

The Jedi segments use basic lightsaber slashing and two force powers, which rely on a force power bar, lightsaber <b>throw</b> and <b>force</b> push.|$|R

5000|$|Glide - The glide of a disc is best {{described}} as how much it is affected by wind. Ratings range from 1 to 6. A disc with a glide of 1 will be relatively unaffected by winds and will tend to fly on the thrower's power more than anything.

5000|$|The ice in {{the game}} may be fast (keen) or slow. If the ice is keen, a rock will travel farther with a given amount of weight (<b>throwing</b> <b>force)</b> on it. The speed of the ice is {{measured}} in seconds. One such measure, known as [...] "hog-to-hog" [...] time, is {{the speed of the}} stone and is the time in seconds the rock takes from the moment it crosses the near hog line till it crosses the far hog line. If this number is lower, the rock is moving faster, so again low numbers mean more speed. The ice in a match will be somewhat consistent and thus this measure of speed {{can also be used to}} measure how far down the ice the rock will travel. Once it is determined that a rock taking (for example) 13 seconds to go from hog line to hog line will stop on the tee line, the curler can know that if the hog-to-hog time is matched by a future stone, that stone will likely stop at approximately the same location. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 16 seconds for guards, 14 seconds for draws, and 8 seconds for peel weight.|$|R
