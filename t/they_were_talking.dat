5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|E
5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

Tom Brass argued that unfree labor is acceptable to capital. Historian Greg Grandin argues that capitalism has its origins in slavery: [...] "when historians talk about the Atlantic market revolution, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about capitalism. And when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about capitalism, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about slavery." [...] Historian Edward E.

Almeida hailed the Emily and after {{making sure it}} was an American ship, let it go. When <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> a schooner with 23 guns stopped the Emily again: {{this time it was}} the Almeyda, and Captain Wilson came aboard. This time it was decided that the cargo of sugar, coffee, and leather was Spanish, so Wilson seized them.|$|E

25|$|Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, a mestizo {{historian}} and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote {{an account of}} the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan oral tradition. According to Ixtlilxóchitl, the three lords were joking cheerfully with one another because of a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve, as Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Lynch {{had begun to}} work in {{television}} as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled The Cowboy and the Frenchman for French television in 1989. Around this time, he met the television producer Mark Frost, who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series Hill Street Blues, {{and they decided to}} start working together on a biopic of singer and actress Marilyn Monroe based upon Anthony Summers's book, The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named One Saliva Bubble, but that did not see completion either. While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called Northwest Passage but would eventually become the television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991).|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} 35 minutes, there were {{technical}} difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay {{as well as}} with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital. When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened. However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil. While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments.|$|E

Dahl said, [...] "I did it within my organization to confirm my suspicions. This was in a studio filled with microphones and cameras.

So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and said we should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini {{was the first one}} who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman, and Benny Blanco, who also produced the song.

Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol.

500|$|The {{downloadable}} episode Turnabout Reclaimed {{was written}} by the game designer Yuki Nakamura, {{with the concept of}} [...] "lighthearted fun" [...] to set it apart from the main game. The first thing she decided on was to feature an orca, and have the story take place in an aquarium; it took her several tries to decide {{on the rest of the}} story. One of the scrapped ideas involved the orca stealing treasures from the aquarium and attacking people by the shore during its escape to the sea, with the episode's mystery involving the reason for the orca's behavior. The opening for this draft would have involved guards and detective Fulbright vaguely referring to someone escaping; the intention was that the player would think <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about Blackquill, before it was revealed to be the orca.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Manoj and Babli {{began to}} show {{interest}} in each other. Manoj was {{two years older than}} Babli.

Chanderpati recalled, [...] "We knew about Babli long before they decided to marry each other. She would call up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together. If I did walk into the room while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> Manoj would quickly disconnect the phone and run off to avoid any questioning." [...] She continued, [...] "I even went to Babli's house and told her mother that Manoj and Babli were seeing each other.

500|$|To Freeman Dyson, {{one thing}} at least was clear: Sin'ichirō Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman {{understood}} what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about even {{if no one else}} did, but had not published anything. Moreover, he was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the Physical Review in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on [...] "A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics" [...] attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on [...] "The Theory of Positrons" [...] addressed the Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation, and introduced what is now called the Feynman propagator. Finally, in papers on the [...] "Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction" [...] in 1950 and [...] "An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics" [...] in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.|$|E
