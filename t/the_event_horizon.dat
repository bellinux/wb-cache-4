5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> of these stellar remnants.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon.</b> At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict {{with one of the}} basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E

At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution.

5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon,</b> random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view of {{the process}} is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle–antiparticle pair to appear close to <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> of a black hole.

In order to preserve total energy, the particle that fell into the black hole {{must have had a}} negative energy (with respect to an observer far away from the black hole).

40|$|Abstract. The initial low entropy of the {{universe}} has allowed irreversible processes, such as the reader reading this abstract, to happen in {{the universe}}. This initial low entropy is due to a low value for the initial gravitational entropy {{of the universe}}. The standard �CDM cosmology has a cosmic <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> and an associated Gibbons-Hawking entropy. We compute the entropy of the universe including the entropy of <b>the</b> current <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> and <b>the</b> entropy of the matter and photons within <b>the</b> cosmic <b>event</b> <b>horizon.</b> We estimate <b>the</b> entropy of <b>the</b> current cosmic <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> to be 2. 6 ± 0. 3 x 10 122 k and find it to be ~ 10 19 times larger than the next most dominant contribution, which is from super massive black holes. We plot an entropy budget as a function of time and find that <b>the</b> cosmic <b>event</b> <b>horizon</b> entropy has dominated other sources of entropy since 10 - 20 seconds after the big bang.

25|$|Hawking {{radiation}} {{also known}} as Hawking–Zel'dovich radiation is blackbody radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes, due to quantum effects near <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>horizon.</b> It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974, and sometimes also after Jacob Bekenstein, who predicted that black holes should have a finite entropy.|$|E
25|$|The quantum {{fluctuations}} at {{that tiny}} point, in Hawking's original calculation, contain all the outgoing radiation.

25|$|The {{holographic}} principle {{was inspired by}} black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected.
