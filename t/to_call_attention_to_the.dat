25|$|When in 1920 the {{informal}} white-line printmakers' group organized its own exhibition, Weinrich showed a dozen works, including one called Cows Grazing in the Dunes near Provincetown. This print shows greater tendency to abstraction than eitherBroken Fence or the prints made by other Provincetown {{artists of the}} time. The cows and dunes are recognizable but not presented realistically. The white lines serve to emphasize the blocks of muted colors which are the print's main pictorial elements. Weinrich uses {{the texture of the}} wood surface <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two-dimensional plane—the paper on which she made the print—in contrast with the implicit depth of foreground and background of cows, dunes, and sky. While the work is not Cubist, it has a proto-Cubist feel {{in a way that is}} similar to some of the more abstract paintings of Paul Cézanne.|$|E
25|$|There {{were major}} changes {{following}} World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem {{was the scene}} of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords {{to improve the quality of}} housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations. The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects. From the mid-20th century, the low quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home. In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America.|$|E

500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were {{designed}} in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an [...] "aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass" [...] {{with the use}} of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings. The aim was <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increasingly complex three-dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely [...] "short buildings made taller with additional stories". Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath. Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one looked up the building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.|$|E

500|$|The phrase's literal use extends {{into the}} 21st century, with Sara Boyce of the Children's Law Centre in Northern Ireland drawing {{on it to}} {{advocate}} for the legal rights of the region's children. The 2008 book Child Labour in a Globalized World used the phrase <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role of debt bondage in child labor. Sara Dillon of Suffolk University Law School used the phrase [...] "What about the children" [...] in her 2009 book, International Children's Rights, to focus on child-labor program conditions. Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book, Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy, writing that {{in the absence of}} child labor some youth faced starvation. In a 2010 book on human rights, Children's Rights and Human Development, child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry used the phrase [...] "think of the children" [...] to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth.|$|E
500|$|The Act of Killing was {{screened}} only in underground venues in Indonesia, but {{its success}} led to media coverage there, generating controversy and opening {{a conversation about}} the past. In Oppenheimer's BAFTAs acceptance speech, he reported that the subject is receiving more attention, and that the film [...] "is helping to catalyse a change in how Indonesia talks about its past". Oppenheimer also used the platform afforded by the awards <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "collective responsibility" [...] of the United States and United Kingdom for [...] "participating and ignoring" [...] the crimes of 1965–66. When it was nominated for an Academy Award, the Indonesian government responded with a full-page statement about the killings and the film in the Jakarta Globe. The response {{marks the first time}} the government has admitted wrongdoing. The nomination also stoked controversy in China, where it had not been well-known that Chinese people were the target of a significant amount of the violence.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} October23, while Sandy was {{developing}} in the Caribbean, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicted the storm would strike the East Coast of the United States, while most other tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the storm would move out to sea. By the next day, various computer models agreed that Sandy would interact with a trough over the eastern United States {{and turn to}} the west. About five days before landfall, the ECMWF, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and Navy Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS) models predicted Sandy would strike the Delmarva Peninsula, while the American Global Forecast System (GFS) model anticipated the hurricane would move out to sea; the remaining models were between the two scenarios. By four days before landfall, the NHC was forecasting a landfall on New Jersey, as were most of the computer models. In general, the European computer models performed better than the United States ones, due to the European models' higher resolution. MIT professor Kerry Emanuel used the moment <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> under-performance of US models, and to recommend a [...] "dedicated effort" [...] to reverse it.|$|E
