5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E

5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} any blood relationship between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E

5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to be provided with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E
5|$|Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{invites the}} entire office staff to {{a celebration of}} Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, which Michael Scott (Steve Carell) mistakenly {{believes}} to be an Indian version of Halloween. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) fails to make a favorable impression on Kelly's parents, who in turn try to set up Kelly with a young doctor. Initially reluctant to attend the festival, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) gives in and ends up enjoying herself. Inspired by a conversation with Kelly's parents about Hindu marriage customs, Michael publicly proposes to Carol (Nancy Carell). Uncomfortable, Carol declines his offer and leaves the room. She later explains that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> their ninth date, and drives home, leaving Michael to find a ride.|$|E
5|$|Many modern historians, {{who usually}} {{consider}} Herodotus more reliable, add the 1,000 Lacedaemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men {{as a standard}} number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed {{later on in the}} battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as 786 the {{creation}} of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured {{the creation of a}}n archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire). Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that Jænberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris. Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.|$|E
5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90cm (35in) in length and weighing up to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> 60% {{of the weight of}} a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E

5|$|With that said, honeybees perform {{some level}} of {{pollination}} of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American economy would be lost, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E
5|$|Coronations may be {{performed}} {{for a person}} other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father HenryII; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> one of two instances {{of its kind in}} England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as queen consort. If the king is already married {{at the time of his}} coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may {{be performed}}. The first such coronation was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and MaryII. The most recent was that of GeorgeVI and the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn's in 1533. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, CharlesII, did not have a separate coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza. In some instances, the king's wife was simply unable to join him in the coronation ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV's estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was prevented from being crowned with him and when she showed up at Westminster Abbey she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657. A Prince of Wales, usually the monarch's heir apparent, may also be crowned in a ceremony known as an investiture.|$|E
