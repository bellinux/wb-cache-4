5|$|He is also {{credited}} with the writing of A Defence of Freemasonry (1765), also known as A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered, <b>that</b> <b>response</b> to Laurence Dermott's Ahiman Rezon. Although {{there is no direct}} attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers <b>that</b> <b>response,</b> or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
25|$|The {{response}} {{time of the}} MOV is not standardized. The sub-nanosecond MOV response claim {{is based on the}} material's intrinsic {{response time}}, but will be slowed down by other factors such as the inductance of component leads and the mounting method. <b>That</b> <b>response</b> time is also qualified as insignificant when compared to a transient having an 8µs rise-time, thereby allowing ample time for the device to slowly turn-on. When subjected to a very fast, <1 ns rise-time transient, response times for the MOV are in the 40–60nbsp&ns range.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until this}} time, with the {{exception}} of Strawbridge, none of the missionaries or American preachers was ordained. Consequently, the Methodist people received the sacraments at the hands of ministers from established Anglican churches. Most of the Anglican priests were Loyalists who fled to England, New York or Canada during the war. In the absence of Anglican ordination, a group of native preachers ordained themselves. This caused a split between the Asbury faction and the southern preachers. Asbury mediated the crisis by convincing the southern preachers to wait for Wesley's response to the sacramental crisis. <b>That</b> <b>response</b> came in 1784.|$|E
25|$|VIDA: Women in Literary Arts was co-founded in 2009 by poets Erin Belieu and Cate Marvin. Belieu and Marvin, {{because they}} are both poets and teachers, had been acquainted with one another for some time. However, due to there being {{a small amount of}} {{opportunities}} for women in the literary community, they perceived themselves as being in competition with one another. That perception changed when Marvin sent Belieu an email detailing how isolated she felt as a female writer, and questioning why there was no feminist conversation happening in literary circles. Belieu then forwarded the email to hundreds of writers, and it received a huge response. Based on <b>that</b> <b>response,</b> Belieu and Marvin decided to co-found VIDA: Women in Literary Arts.|$|E
25|$|War {{broke out}} again in 1722 and 1723. Called the Second and Third Natchez wars by the French, they were {{essentially}} two phases {{of a single}} conflict. It began in White Apple, where an argument over a debt resulted in a French trader's killing one of the Natchez villagers. The French commander of Fort Rosalie reprimanded the murderer. Unsatisfied with <b>that</b> <b>response,</b> Natchez warriors of White Apple retaliated by attacking nearby French settlements. Tattooed Serpent's diplomatic efforts helped restore peace. But within a year, Bienville led a French army into Natchez territory, intent on punishing the warriors of White Apple. Bienville demanded the surrender of a White Apple chief as recompense for the earlier Natchez attacks. Under pressure from the French and other Natchez villages, White Apple turned the chief over to the French.|$|E

50|$|An obvious {{but often}} {{overlooked}} factor when analyzing <b>response</b> distributions is <b>that</b> <b>responses</b> are not instantaneous, but take some {{amount of time}} to emit (Killeen, 1994). These ceilings on response rate are often accounted for by competition from other responses, but less often for the fact <b>that</b> <b>responses</b> cannot always be emitted at the same rate at which they are elicited (Killeen & Sitomer, 2003). This limiting factor {{must be taken into account}} in order to correctly characterize what responding could be theoretically, and what it will be empirically.|$|R

25|$|When Japan {{asserted}} that nuclear weapons {{must be removed}} after reversion, they were withdrawn from sites in Okinawa during the early 1970s. Kristensen writes that criticisms following a 1969 Far East visit by a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee prompted the JCS in 1974 to order {{a study of the}} forward-deployed tactical nuclear weapons at East Asian bases. The study found the number of sites could be reduced because they had had more weapons than required, as well as <b>that</b> <b>response</b> teams at sites with nuclear weapons were unprepared for a coordinated attack and might be vulnerable to terrorists. Following the JCS order, the Department of Defense began withdrawing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Taiwan in 1974, and from the Philippines in 1976. Kristensen writes that the DOD withdrawal of forward-deployed weapons was 'not simply' due to the sovereignty-return negotiations.|$|E
500|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} the instructions given to subjects in an acceptability judgment task can influence the subjects' brain responses to stimuli. [...] One experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the [...] "acceptability" [...] of sentences they did not show an N400 brain response (a response commonly associated with semantic processing), but that they did show <b>that</b> <b>response</b> when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences [...] "made sense".|$|E
500|$|Progress in {{understanding}} {{the functions of the}} basal ganglia has been slow. [...] The most popular hypotheses, broadly stated, propose that the basal ganglia {{play a central role in}} action selection. The action selection theory in its simplest form proposes that when a person or animal is in a situation where several behaviors are possible, activity in the basal ganglia determines which of them is executed, by releasing <b>that</b> <b>response</b> from inhibition while continuing to inhibit other motor systems that if activated would generate competing behaviors. Thus the basal ganglia, in this concept, are responsible for initiating behaviors, but not for determining the details of how they are carried out. In other words, they essentially form a decision-making system.|$|E

500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>response</b> motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am and I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
500|$|The term {{antagonist}} {{was originally}} coined to describe different profiles of drug effects. The biochemical {{definition of a}} receptor antagonist was introduced by Ariens and Stephenson in the 1950s. The current accepted definition of receptor antagonist {{is based on the}} receptor occupancy model. It narrows the definition of antagonism to consider only those compounds with opposing activities at a single receptor. Agonists were thought to turn [...] "on" [...] a single cellular response by binding to the receptor, thus initiating a biochemical mechanism for change within a cell. Antagonists were thought to turn [...] "off" [...] <b>that</b> <b>response</b> by 'blocking' the receptor from the agonist. This definition also remains in use for physiological antagonists, substances that have opposing physiological actions, but act at different receptors. For example, histamine lowers arterial pressure through vasodilation at the histamine H1 receptor, while adrenaline raises arterial pressure through vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptor activation.|$|E

40|$|Volition {{has been}} debated for {{thousands}} of years:  what is it, {{how is it possible}} for biophysical beings to behave in a voluntary manner, indeed, does volition exist?  Evolution of volition has rarely been part of the discussion.  In this paper, I argue that operant-conditioning studies provide evidence for evolved volition.   Three attributes are common to operant and voluntary behaviors.  One is <b>that</b> <b>responses</b> are goal-directed, purposeful, some say rational, or controlled by reinforcing consequences.   A second is <b>that</b> the <b>responses</b> vary – from random-like to repetitive – with predictability (or unpredictability) depending upon contexts and consequences.   A third attribute is <b>that</b> <b>responses</b> appear to be self-generated or, in operant terms, emitted.   These attributes are found in many species, simple to complex, but species also differ in details.   Taken together, the evidence supports an evolutionary basis of volition...|$|R
50|$|Another {{challenge}} to validity is <b>that</b> <b>responses</b> and evaluations can have alternative explanations. For instance, differences in responses between subjects {{may be more}} consistent with an introverted or extraverted personality, rather than with an anal personality type.|$|R
2500|$|Metallica and Rubin {{initially}} {{declined to}} comment on the issue, while the band's co-manager Cliff Burnstein stated that complainers were in a minority and <b>that</b> <b>response</b> to the album had otherwise been [...] "overwhelmingly positive". Ulrich later confirmed in an interview with Blender, that some creative control regarding the album's production had indeed been transferred to Rubin but also stressed his satisfaction with the final product.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{a report}} to the International Committee for Weights and Measures (known also by its French-language {{initials}} CIPM) stated <b>that</b> <b>response</b> to the proposal of the uno [...] "had been almost entirely negative" [...] and the principal proponent [...] "recommended dropping the idea". To date, the uno has not been adopted by any standards organization and it appears unlikely it will ever become an officially sanctioned way to express low-value (high-ratio) dimensionless quantities. The proposal was instructive, however, as to the perceived shortcomings of the current options for denoting dimensionless quantities.|$|E
2500|$|A {{simulation}} {{study from}} the University of Utah Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers. [...] Meta-analysis by The Canadian Automobile Association and The University of Illinois found <b>that</b> <b>response</b> time while using both hands-free and hand-held phones was approximately 0.5 standard deviations higher than normal driving (i.e., an average driver, while talking on a cell phone, has response times of a driver in roughly the 40th percentile).|$|E

5000|$|The {{items are}} locally stochastically independent: this means <b>that</b> <b>responses</b> to any two items {{by the same}} {{respondent}} {{should not be the}} function any other aspect of the respondent or the item, but his or her position on the latent trait.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{early studies}} of {{non-human}} economic reasoning {{were performed on}} rats and pigeons in an operant conditioning chamber. These studies looked at things like peck rate (in {{the case of the}} pigeon) and bar-pressing rate (in the case of the rat) given certain conditions of reward. Early researchers claim, for example, <b>that</b> <b>response</b> pattern (pecking/bar-pressing rate) is an appropriate analogy to human labor supply. Researchers in this field advocate for the appropriateness of using animal economic behavior to understand the elementary components of human economic behavior.

2500|$|... "A: In my opinion, {{based on}} my reading of the law, yes, it was.

It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court."

2500|$|With <b>that</b> <b>response,</b> Ord {{rushed to}} the front of the brigade, advising them to support the charge of the regulars. Captain John Bigelow, Jr., {{commander}} of D Troop of the 10th with his second in command of Ord in the lead, moved out of the trenches and advanced up the slope. Other units seeing the [...] "Buffalo Soldiers" [...] advance moved forward without commands to do so. General Hawkins apparently was not opposed to the attack since once the men began he joined in directing supporting regiments. At 150yards from the top of the hill the troops charged, cutting their way through the barbed wire. Bigelow was hit four times before falling. There he continued to encourage his men to not stop until the top.|$|E
