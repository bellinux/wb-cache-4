5|$|The current <b>training</b> <b>ground</b> {{is located}} at Bodymoor Heath near Kingsbury in north Warwickshire, the site for which was {{purchased}} by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced {{a state of the}} art GB£13million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. However, work on Bodymoor was suspended by Ellis due to financial problems, and was left in an unfinished state until new owner Randy Lerner made it one of his priorities to make the site {{one of the best in}} world football. The new <b>training</b> <b>ground</b> was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager Martin O'Neill, then team captain Gareth Barry and 1982 European Cup winning team captain Dennis Mortimer, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|On 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Adolf Hitler, came to power and began to rearm Germany. The Heer (Germany Army) was increased and modernized with a strong focus on the Panzer (tank) force. Personnel were recruited from the cavalry. In October 1935 Panzer-Regiment 2 was created and was subordinated to the 1st Panzer Division, at the time under command of General Maximilian von Weichs. The soldiers of the I. Abteilung (1st Battalion) came from Saxony and Thuringia, the II. Abteilung (2nd Battalion) was made up from soldiers from Silesia. Strachwitz, who had served as an officer of the reserves in Reiter-Regiment 7 (7th Cavalry Regiment) in Breslau, had asked to be transferred to the Panzer force and, in May 1936, participated in his first manoeuvre on the <b>training</b> <b>ground</b> at Ohrdruf, followed by an exercise of live firing on the gunnery <b>training</b> <b>ground</b> at Putlos—today in the administrative district of Oldenburg-Land—near the Baltic Sea. A year later, from July to August 1937, he participated in a second reserve training exercise on the Silesian training grounds at Neuhammer—present-day Świętoszów.|$|E

40|$|High-risk outdoor {{recreation}} allows its enthusiasts to reach unprecedented levels of adrenaline; it also contains risks and requires specific training (in part technological). In particular, its participants {{must be ready}} to react efficiently during an emergency or in response to an accident. Technological <b>training</b> <b>grounds</b> can simulate particular contexts and emergency situations as a place for recreationists to train and practice. In this paper, we use the practice of avalanche companion rescue as a case study to explore how technological <b>training</b> <b>grounds</b> support recreationist <b>training.</b> Our results offer insights into how avalanche beacon training parks support skill development and team coordination training. We also present strategies to orient the design of technological <b>training</b> <b>grounds</b> beyond avalanche companion rescue...|$|R
