5|$|That night, as Jack and Kate {{decide to}} search for the plane cockpit as its <b>transceiver</b> would allow the {{survivors}} to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot (Greg Grunberg) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for Fiji and hit wake turbulence. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the <b>transceiver,</b> but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the <b>transceiver</b> and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, the {{availability}} of <b>transceivers</b> that include the 6-meter band has increased greatly. Many commercial HF <b>transceivers</b> now include the 6-meter band, as do some handheld VHF/UHF <b>transceivers.</b> There are also a number of stand-alone 6-meter band <b>transceivers,</b> although commercial production of these has been relatively rare in recent years. Despite support in more available radios, however, the 6-meter band does not share the popularity of amateur radio's 2-meter band. This is due, in large part, to the larger size of 6-meter antennas, power limitations in some countries outside the United States, and the 6-meter band's greater susceptibility to local electrical interference.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the {{benefits}} of using tunable <b>transceivers</b> for reducing the required number of electronic ports in WDM/TDM networks. We show that such <b>transceivers</b> {{can be used to}} efficiently “groom ” sub-wavelength traffic in the optical domain and so can significantly reduce the number of electronic ports compared to the fixed tuned case. We provide a new formulation for this “tunable grooming ” problem. We show that in general this problem is NP-complete, but we are able to efficiently solve it for many cases of interest. When the number of wavelengths in the network is not limited, we show that each node only needs the minimum number of <b>transceivers</b> (i. e., no more <b>transceivers</b> than the amount of traffic that it generates). This holds regardless of the network topology or traffic pattern. When the number of wavelengths is limited, we show an analogous result for both uniform and hub traffic in a ring.

25|$|Transponder – In practice, {{the signal}} {{inputs and outputs}} will not be {{electrical}} but optical instead (typically at 1550nm). This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, {{which is exactly what}} a transponder is.

Transponders that don't use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E
