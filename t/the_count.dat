5|$|The first {{records of}} Sauvey Castle date around 1216, during the First Barons' War, when the {{government}} of the young Henry III ordered the royal castle to be surrendered to William de Fors, <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> of Aumale. <b>The</b> <b>count</b> established a power base in the region, but in 1218 William Marshal, the regent, ordered him to return it to the Crown; <b>the</b> <b>count</b> declined. Further demands followed until, in 1220, royal forces besieged and took the count's castle at nearby Rockingham. In a face-saving solution, <b>the</b> <b>count</b> finally returned Sauvey to the King, supposedly of his own free will, in exchange for the cancellation of any debts that he might have owed to the Crown.|$|E

After the title of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> of Foix had been passed to the kings of Navarre, and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France, an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to <b>the</b> <b>count</b> of Foix {{in regard to the}} paréage. Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812–1813. After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again.

50|$|Originally part of Comminges, {{the valleys}} of Aure, Barousse, Neste, and Magnoac were {{detached}} from Comminges in the 11th century and were divided between <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> of Aure, vassals of {{the kings of}} Aragon, and <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> of Astarac (in Gascony).

Thus, the four valleys were unified under <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> of Labarthe, and began {{to be known as}} Quatre-Vallées. <b>The</b> <b>counts</b> of Labarthe were vassals of the kings of Aragon, and so Quatre-Vallées was part of the kingdom of Aragon.|$|R

In March 1791, the National Assembly created a law {{outlining}} the regency of Louis Charles in case his father died while he was still too young to reign. This law awarded the regency to Louis Charles' nearest male relative in France (at that time <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> of Provence), and after him, the Duke of Orléans (bypassing <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> of Artois).

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by <b>the</b> <b>count</b> of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before <b>the</b> <b>count</b> concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat <b>the</b> <b>count,</b> Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start <b>the</b> <b>count</b> over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E

5|$|Although John was <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
