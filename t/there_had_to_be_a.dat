5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has {{found that there was}} a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E

These buildings were to have a shared symmetrical late Baroque portico, and a place d’armes was to be in the whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|During Bracton's {{time the}} common law was {{separate}} from the canon law of the Church. The former had come to mean all that was not exceptional or special. It was distinguished from Church law, as well as peculiar local customs and royal decrees, and represented the general law of the land. There were some legislative acts, such as the Statute of Merton (1236) and the Statute of Marlborough (1267), however the mass of new law introduced {{during the reign of}} Henry III of England, was by novel creative writs and new forms of action invented in the Court of Chancery and sanctioned by {{the common law}} courts. Bracton knew many writs that were unknown to Ranulf de Glanvill.

All three suggested, however, that the episode still had its strengths; for Seale, it was as [...] "brilliantly acted and constructed as you'd expect", Dessau considered it watchable, and Owen felt it was enjoyable to watch {{with a number of}} funny moments. Shennan, writing for the Liverpool Echo, wrote that [...] "perhaps <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dud – or, at least, disappointing – episode sooner or later", noting that you [...] "can't win 'em all".|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as – unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects – the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence [...] before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that [...] "techniques {{that had been used}} against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP , and <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage – which usually meant when trials were showing promise." [...] He concluded at the time, in April 1945, that the intelligence failure had not made much practical difference {{given the fact that the}} Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: [...] "there was little warning; [...] there was little danger." ...|$|E

From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Post {{independence}} feminists {{began to}} redefine {{the extent to which}} women were allowed to engage in the workforce. Prior to independence, most feminists accepted the sexual divide within the labour force. However, feminists in the 1970s challenged the inequalities that had been established and fought to reverse them. These inequalities included unequal wages for women, relegation of women to 'unskilled' spheres of work, and restricting women as a reserve army for labour. In other words, the feminists' aim was to abolish the free service of women who were essentially being used as cheap capital. Feminist class-consciousness also came into focus in the 1970s, with feminists recognising the inequalities not just between men and women but also within power structures such as caste, tribe, language, religion, region, class etc. This also posed as a challenge for feminists while shaping their overreaching campaigns as <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> focus within efforts to ensure that fulfilling the demands of one group would not create further inequalities for another. [...] Now, in the early twenty-first century, the focus of the Indian feminist movement has gone beyond treating women as useful members of society and a right to parity, but also having the power to decide the course of their personal lives and the right of self-determination.|$|E

500|$|The Hardy Boys {{began to}} be {{published}} in paperback in 1979. The Hardys were also featured in two new series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles and the Clues Brothers. The latter series, modeled on the Nancy Drew Notebooks, was aimed at a younger audience, and ran from 1997 to 2000. In contrast, the Casefiles, begun a decade earlier in 1987, was aimed at an older audience than the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories. In the new series, the Hardys' work with a secret government organization simply called the [...] "Network", with which they collaborate to [...] "infiltrate organized crime, battle terrorists and track down assassins around the world." [...] The Hardys' personalities are portrayed as more separate and distinct, and they sometimes fight; in the first of the series, Dead on Target, for example, the brothers brawl after Frank tries to restrain Joe after Joe's girlfriend, Iola Morton, is killed by a car bomb. In general, the series is more violent, and the Hardy Boys carry various guns; Lines like [...] "Joe! Hand me the Uzi!" [...] are not out of character. Barbara Steiner, a Casefiles ghostwriter, describes a sample plot outline: [...] "I was told that Joe Hardy would get involved with a waitress, a black widow kind of character, and that Joe would get arrested for murder. I was told the emphasis was on high action and suspense and <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cliff-hanger ending to every chapter." ...|$|E
