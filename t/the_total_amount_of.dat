40|$|AbstractBecause endothelial {{cells are}} {{fundamental}} {{to the maintenance of}} the functional integrity of the vascular wall, endothelial modifications in altered gravity conditions might offer some insights into the mechanisms leading to circulatory impairment in astronauts. We cultured human endothelial cells in a dedicated centrifuge (MidiCAR) to generate hypergravity and in two different devices, namely the Rotating Wall Vessel and the Random Positioning Machine, to generate hypogravity. Hypogravity stimulated endothelial growth, did not affect migration, and enhanced nitric oxide production. It also remodeled the actin cytoskeleton and reduced <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> actin. Hypergravity did not affect endothelial growth, markedly stimulated migration, and enhanced nitric oxide synthesis. In addition, hypergravity altered the distribution of actin fibers without, however, affecting <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> actin. A short exposure to hypergravity (8  min) abolished the hypogravity induced growth advantage.

Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands.
