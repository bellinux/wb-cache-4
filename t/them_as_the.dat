50|$|The {{history of}} Mataram area <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{capital of the}} Central Javanese Medang kingdom {{is also part of}} the {{historical}} Yawadvipa or Bhumijava (the land of Java), and the classical Javanese civilisation.

5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead.

This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} {{casualties}} on 1 February 1741 in Pati, Chinese insurgents spread through central Java, joining {{forces with the}} Javanese while staging sham battles to convince the Dutch that the Javanese were supporting <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> deception became increasingly obvious and the Chinese drew closer to Semarang, Visscher became mentally unstable. After capturing Rembang, Tanjung, and Jepara, the joint Chinese and Javanese army besieged Semarang in June 1741. In response, Visscher issued an order to eliminate all Chinese in Java. Prince Cakraningrat IV of Madura offered his alliance, and worked from Madura westward, killing any Chinese he and his troops could find and quashing the rebellion in eastern Java.|$|E

She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash again. Just then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer bottle with a note in it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her.

5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to the Kazon was generally negative. Some reviewers praised their ability to capture Voyager and maroon its crew on a desolate planet, while others felt they were poorly developed copies of Klingons and that the second season focused too much on them. The Kazon were included on several lists ranking the worst villains in Star Trek history, and were cited {{as an example of}} the racist implications in the franchise's alien species. During her re-watching of the series, TrekToday Michelle Erica Green provided extensive criticism of the alien species, questioning the decision to feature <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> primary antagonists instead of the Vidiians, and Captain Kathryn Janeway's refusal to share technology with them. The Kazon were also poorly received by the show's cast members, who did not find them to be strong villains or compelling additions to the narrative.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} {{shortages of}} pilots and equipment, No.84 Wing was generally {{able to keep}} pace with the army's requirements. A detachment of No.36 Squadron, flying C-47 Dakotas, was employed to augment the wing's supply capabilities. Up until the end of June 1945, No.5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No.17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No.36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.17 AOP Flight.|$|E

5|$|For example, of the 15 dolphin {{carcasses}} {{found in}} the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because {{a variety of factors}} make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.|$|E
