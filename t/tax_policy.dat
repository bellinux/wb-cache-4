5|$|On August 31, Huntsman made a {{major policy}} announcement, calling for, amongst other things such as more {{aggressive}} action on completing free trade agreements, a <b>tax</b> <b>policy</b> modeled on the Simpson-Bowles plan, specifically: elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividends, elimination of all deductions and credits, in favor of significantly lower general rates, with brackets of 8, 14 and 23 percent, and lowering the general corporate rate from 35 to 25%.|$|E

40|$|The first {{differentiated}} <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> {{for small}} and medium enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa {{were introduced in}} 2001. Several relief measures have followed, the most recent being the introduction in the 2008 / 9 budget of a presumptive turnover tax system and venture capital incentives for investments in high-growth and high-tech SMEs. The present study uses a qualitative systematic literature review to assess the effectiveness of using differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> to address the constraints that have been imposed on South African SMEs. It draws on international experiences {{in the use of}} differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> to address constraints imposed on SMEs. Thereafter it focuses on differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> in South Africa and considers the effectiveness of using differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> to address constraints that have been imposed on SMEs. Research in other countries indicates that when differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> are used in isolation, they are not very successful in bringing about changes in the level of entrepreneurial activity. However, these policies can assist in creating an environment that is conducive to the growth of SMEs and can alleviate the constraints faced by SMEs. The effectiveness of differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> in the alleviation of the constraints imposed on small and medium enterprises can be improved by means of various non-tax policy measures. The National Treasury has used differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> to target two specific constraints for SMEs, namely access to equity finance and easing of the tax compliance burden. This study concludes that the current differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> for small and medium enterprises that are articulated in tax legislation do not address the constraints identified by the National Treasury effectively. The findings of this study cast doubt on the ability of the differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> in South Africa to alleviate the constraints that SMEs face in this country. Furthermore, it poses the question whether the main objective of the policies is not to collect more revenue by broadening the tax base. The study focuses on the differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> that came into effect before August 2008. The effectiveness of the differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> that were proposed in the 2008 / 2009 budget (venture capital incentives and presumptive turnover tax) will depend on the details of the tax legislation that is promulgated. Future research could determine the effectiveness of these differentiated <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> in addressing the constraints with which SMEs are faced.

5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed <b>tax</b> <b>policy</b> in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E

The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 300,000 horses {{existed in}} Finland when the Finnhorse {{studbook}} {{was established in}} the beginning of the 20thcentury. The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry <b>tax</b> <b>policy</b> made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing on urban form in an economy in which high- and low-income households choose between city and suburban communities. Because housing <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> differentially affect the relative after-tax price of housing for high- and low-income households, and because the extent of capitalization of housing <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> can differ across city and suburban communities, our analysis finds that housing <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> can affect not only the density of the metropolitan area but also can influence where rich and poor households choose to live. We also show that the impacts of housing <b>tax</b> <b>policies</b> differ depending on whether land use constraints such as suburban large lot zoning exist. If there are no land use constraints present, increasing a subsidy to home ownership that is positively correlated with the income of the owner tends to lead to the decentralization of both rich and poor, although there are conditions under which the ric [...] ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>policies</b> have {{profound}} {{effects on the}} temporal composition and on the intertemporal evolution of the macro economy.
