40|$|Abstract Novolac type {{liquefied}} wood/phenol/formalde-hyde (LWPF) resins were synthesized from liquefied {{wood and}} formaldehyde. The {{average molecular weight}} of the LWPF resin made from <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> wood reacted in an at-mospheric three neck flask increased with increasing P/W ratio. However, it decreased with increasing phenol/wood ratio when using a sealed Parr reactor. On average, the LWPF resin made from <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> wood reacted in the Parr reactor had lower molecular weight than those from the atmospheric three neck flask. The infrared spectra of the LWPF resins were {{similar to that of}} the conven-tional novolac resin but showed a major difference at the 1800 – 1600 cm− 1 region. These results indicate that lique-fied wood could partially substitute phenol in the novolac resin synthesis. The composites with <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> wood resin from the sealed Parr reactor yielded higher thickness swelling than those with <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> wood resin from the three neck flask likely due to the hydrophilic wood compo-nents incorporated in it and the lower cross-link density than <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> wood resin from the three neck flask during the resin cure process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake {{caused the}} severe {{liquefaction}} of reclaimed {{lands in the}} Tokyo Bay area, from Shinkiba in Tokyo through Urayasu, Ichikawa and Narashino Cities to Chiba City. However, the reclaimed lands that had been improved by the sand compaction pile method, the gravel drain method or other methods did not <b>liquefy.</b> <b>The</b> reclaimed lands that did liquefy had been constructed after around 1966 with soil dredged {{from the bottom of}} the bay. The dredged and filled soils were estimated to have been <b>liquefied</b> by <b>the</b> earthquake. Seismic intensities in <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> zones were not high, although <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> grounds were covered with boiled sand. Most likely it was the very long duration of the main shock, along with the large aftershock that hit 29 min later, which induced the severe liquefaction. Sidewalks and alleys buckled at several sites, probably due to a kind of sloshing around of <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> ground. Moreover, much sand boiled from the ground and the ground subsided significantly because <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> soil was very fine. Many houses settled notably and tilted. In Urayasu City, 3680 houses were more than partially destroyed. Sewage pipes meandered or were broken, their joints were extruded from the ground, and many manholes were horizontally sheared.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{performance}} of a RepRap 3 D printer liquefier by studying its thermal behavior, focusing on the convective heat dissipation developed along <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> body during the 3 D printing process of a workpiece. More specifically, this work tackles with the influence of the airflow generated by a fan coupled to the extruder, on the heat transfer mechanisms during the printing process. The airflow is thus taken as the variable of study. The temperature at the top of <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> body, where a low temperature is desirable for the correct preservation of the 3 D printer components, is analyzed to assess the results for the different printing conditions. For the development of this study, a finite elements model was used to determine the theoretical temperature profile of <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> in a steady state working regime. This mathematical model was then validated with experimental data registered with four thermocouples fixed on the tested extruder. The data was taken for different airflows, finding a relation between printing parameters and resulting tem- perature profile. <b>The</b> <b>liquefier</b> used for experimental data acquisition was the BCNozzle model, designed by the BCN 3 D Technologies of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Determining the correct working parameters is necessary to optimize the fused filament fabrication process on which 3 D printing is based, ensuring a suitable temperature distribution along <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> body. This would allow a correct position of the melting front along <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> channel, and at the same time, a non-excessive temperature at its top, next to the feeding mechanism. This is the relevance of this study, through which a model is obtained to analyze the heat transfer mechanisms, applicable for other working regimes and other extruders based on the same working principles.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of 3 D printing systems as mechatronic devices able to localize manufacturing activities has {{attracted the attention}} in academic and professional labs worldwide. However, little is known from a formal {{point of view about}} the actual possibilities of optimization in terms of hardware and software. This paper proposes alternative geometrical designs of RepRap 3 D printer liquefiers, and offers an evaluation of their thermal performance by analyzing the temperature profiles derived from their functioning in a steady state regime. For that purpose, finite element calculation and experimental techniques are combined and compared. A detachable model of liquefier, used in numerous RepRap 3 D printers, has been taken as a reference to design and manufacture two new variations. As the objective of <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> is to heat the plastic material while limiting the temperature at its top, heat conduction must be prevented by means of a refrigerating fan faced at <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> body. The effect of that fan has been introduced in the system of study, by evaluating the influence of five different fan velocities on the final temperature profile. All combinations of fan speed and liquefier geometry have been calculated through a finite elements model. Then, they have been reproduced experimentally, measuring discrete temperatures at different heights of <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> by a group of thermocouples installed {{on the surface of the}} fins composing <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> heat sink. Results showed that the defined FEM model reproduces acceptably the final temperature profiles obtained by experimental measures. Furthermore, the new proposed design provided with thick fins shows its good performance when the 3 D printing process is performed with a fan speed higher than 10 % (defined according to a PWM function programmed at the 3 D printer's firmware), while its design presents a much lower manufacturing time with regards to the present available design. It is also concluded that refrigerating <b>the</b> <b>liquefier</b> during a standard 3 D printing process with an airflow higher than PWM¿=¿ 20 % is not recommended, due to a fall in efficiency and not remarkable refrigerating effect obtained through it.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a single-stage coaxial pulse tube refrigerator used as an oxygen liquefier is discussed. <b>The</b> <b>liquefier</b> is a half-size laboratory unit for NASA/JSC to demonstrate the technology of liquefying and storing oxygen on Mars. <b>The</b> <b>liquefier</b> {{would be part of}} a plant that extracts oxygen from the Martian carbon dioxide atmosphere and stores the oxygen in liquid form. The liquid oxygen could then be used either for the oxidizer of a fuel or for breathing in a manned mission. The pulse tube and regenerator, which are arranged coaxially, provide 18. 8 W of cooling at 90 K with 222 W of PV input power. The resulting coefficient of performance (COP) is 20. 0 % of the Carnot value based on PV input power, among the highest ever achieved. Liquid nitrogen was produced at a rate of 1. 75 g/min (2. 17 cm 3 /min) with 215 W of PV input power. Oxygen should be produced at about 2. 7 g/min (2. 37 cm 3 /min).

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the characteristics of}} seismic response at liquefied sites, a liquefiable site and a non-liquefiable site were selected, separated by about 500 m and having the same site conditions as Class D in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). A suite of earthquake records on rock sites are selected and scaled to the spectrum of the Joyner, Boore, and Fumal (JBF) attenuation model for a magnitude 7.5 earthquake {{at a distance of}} 50 km. The scaled records were then used to excite the two sites. The effect of pore-water pressure was investigated using the effective stress analysis method, and nonlinear soil behavior was modeled by a soil bounding surface model. Comparisons for spectra, peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground displacement (PGD) and permanent displacement were performed. Results show that the mean ground response spectrum at the non-liquefied site is close to the estimated ground response spectrum from the JBF model, but the mean ground response spectrum at <b>the</b> <b>liquefied</b> site is much lower than the estimated ground response spectrum from the JBF model for periods of up to 1.3 s.
