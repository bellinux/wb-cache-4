25|$|Some {{missions}} {{permit the}} player {{to use the}} dragon Saphira in combat. The gameplay mechanics within these levels are largely {{similar to those in}} ground-based levels, with the exception of some different attack moves (such as tail attacks). Protagonist Eragon sits on Saphira's back during these sections, and can be made to fire magic arrows. The player has no choice {{as to whether or not}} they use Saphira. Similarly, the player cannot use Saphira in ground-based levels: <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> for her and she will swoop past, but it is not possible to use this feature to ride Saphira. There is a multiplayer co-op mode which allows two people to play through the main storyline. It is possible to switch from playing a one-player game to a two-player game at any time. There are no Internet multiplayer options.|$|E
25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt {{as part of their}} preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education program should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.|$|E
25|$|SQL Server {{also allows}} stored {{procedures}} to be defined. Stored procedures are parameterized T-SQL queries, that {{are stored in}} the server itself (and not issued by the client application {{as is the case}} with general queries). Stored procedures can accept values sent by the client as input parameters, and send back results as output parameters. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> defined functions, and other stored procedures, including the same stored procedure (up to a set number of times). They can be selectively provided access to. Unlike other queries, stored procedures have an associated name, which is used at runtime to resolve into the actual queries. Also because the code need not be sent from the client every time (as it can be accessed by name), it reduces network traffic and somewhat improves performance. Execution plans for stored procedures are also cached as necessary.|$|E

25|$|The single-player {{campaign}} places {{players in}} the role of Lieutenant Parker (voiced by Alec Baldwin), a United States Army officer, who takes command of a company of troops from both the US and NATO, and who narrates the events of the game's campaign prior to each mission; he neither speaks during missions and cutscenes, nor is his face shown. During missions, players take on enemies scripted for them to deal while the AI handles the remainder of action on the battlefield, though {{a large portion of the}} action is still focused on the player, which is in contrast to the approach used in RTS titles, in which players are in charge of whole armies and thus responsible for most of the action on the battlefield. Unlike other game modes, players are restricted in missions by what units they can deploy and what tactical aid <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> in, sometimes having to rely on the units they begin with and acquire during a mission.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the NTSB and the FBI {{entered into}} a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that states that, “n the {{immediate}} aftermath of a transportation accident, the NTSB is the presumptive lead investigative agency and will assume control of the accident scene.” The FBI may still conduct a criminal investigation, but the NTSB investigation has priority. When investigative priority remains with the NTSB, the FBI must coordinate its investigative activities with the NTSB investigator-in-charge. This authority includes interviewing witnesses. The MOU states that: “his procedure is intended…to ensure that neither NTSB nor FBI investigative activity unnecessarily complicates or compromises the other agency’s investigation. The new statutory language and the MOU have improved coordination between the NTSB and FBI since the TWA flight 800 accident. Today, FBI and NTSB personnel conduct joint exercises. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> upon one another’s laboratories and other assets. The NTSB and the FBI have designated liaisons to ensure that information flows between agencies, and to coordinate on-scene operations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} about Lindner’s remarks his lawyer sent a routine legal request for discovery to Rep. Neva Walker, an African-American DFL member from Minneapolis. The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I {{can tell you that the}} person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and I deserve respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...Folks who are so focused on this issue don't realize that there is a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E
2500|$|On fight night, {{in front}} of a 6,513 crowd, Hopkins lost to Smith via TKO when he was knocked out of the ring in the 8th round and failed to make it back into the ring as referee Jack Reiss made a 20 count. Smith Jr. seemed to {{struggle}} through the first seven rounds with the boxing skills of Hopkins, although he was ahead on two judges' scorecards at the time of stoppage. In the 8th round, Smith caught Hopkins in the corner and landed five shots to the head that knocked him out of the ring. Hopkins said he was hurt and couldn't get back in the ring. He insisted that he had been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it was not a push. Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, [...] "He shoved me out of the ring. My ankle got twist when I fell out of the ring. I couldn't stand on my feet. If I wouldn't have been pushed out of the ring, I believe he was starting to fade... I can't believe they gave him a TKO. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it a no contest but not a loss. The momentum from his body pushed me. I went out like a soldier. I'm not in a denial." [...] Hopkins sat down with HBO's Max Kellerman in the locker room after the fight and confirmed this would be his final fight. Smith Jr. retained his WBC International light heavyweight title. Hopkins' reported purse was $800,000, compared to Smith's $140,000. According to RingTV, the fight averaged 934,000 viewers, peaking at 1.035m on HBO.|$|E
