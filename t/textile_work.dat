25|$|Textile {{production}} in Michoacan includes embroidery, back strap and foot-pedal loom weaving, and crochet. Weaving {{dates back to}} the pre Hispanic period, when cotton, ixtle and even feathers and rabbit were used to create cloth and other textiles. All weaving was done on back strap looms, and the relatively narrow cloth stitched together when wider pieces were need to items such as huipils and blankets. The Spanish brought sheep and wool was added alongside the native fibers. They also introduced the framed pedal loom, which allows the creation of wider, thicker and longer pieces. The arrival of the Spanish also introduced new designs, such as horses appearing in weavings. <b>Textile</b> <b>work</b> is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.|$|E
25|$|Two {{other very}} {{important}} pre Hispanic handcrafts are textiles and ceramics, whose artisans {{could also be}} full-time and enjoy fairly high status. Purépecha weavers worked with white and brown cotton, {{as well as a}} rougher fiber from the maguey plant called ixtle. According to the Relación de Michoacán, an early colonial period document that describes Purépecha life before the Conquest, <b>textile</b> <b>work</b> was the purview of women, with skills passed down from generation to generation. The richest fabric had feathers or rabbit fur woven into the cotton, and pure white cloth was an easily traded commodity, used as a form of currency. Dyes were from natural sources such as insects and plants, and common colors included blue, black and red. Finished textile goods included shirts, caps, dresses, threads for tying headdresses and doublets worn by warriors.|$|E
500|$|During the Industrial Revolution {{many of the}} townships in {{the region}} {{experienced}} fairly rapid population growth, although Flixton remained an exception, its population growing by only 22per cent between 1801 and 1851. [...] This was {{in stark contrast to}} Altrincham (165%), Bowdon (242%) and Stretford (238%), and is attributed to the emigration of villagers to more industrialised areas like Manchester, and the agricultural depression of the 1830s and 1840s. [...] The domestic production of textiles, popular during the 17th and early 18th centuries in Flixton and other nearby townships, and the newer factory-based system which replaced it, had disappeared in Altrincham {{by the middle of the}} 19th century. [...] Weaving continued in Flixton, although within ten years of the construction of Flixton Cotton Mills in 1851, domestic textile production had ended. [...] In nearby Urmston, 28per cent of the township's population was in 1851 engaged in <b>textile</b> <b>work,</b> but the area did not experience the level of industrialisation seen in towns like Ashton-under-Lyne, east of Manchester, where 16mills were built between 1815 and 1829, doubling the population. [...] The reasons for this reliance on land rather than industry are unclear.|$|E

2500|$|With today’s {{knowledge}} and testing apparatus, {{it can be}} determined with more certainty if contemporary artists are synesthetic. By interviewing these artists, one gets some insights into the process of painting music (cf. Steen, Smilack, Salz). The lines of artistic explorations of synesthesia and scientific research into the subject have become closely intertwined in the last decade. Some contemporary artists are active members of synesthesia associations in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and other countries (cf. Arte Citta) [...] In and outside these associations that house scientists and artists, the exchange of ideas and collaborations between artists and scientists has grown rapidly in the last decades (cf. the Leonardo online bibliography Synesthesia in Art and Science) , and {{this is only a}} small selection of synesthetic work in the arts. New artistic projects on synesthesia are appearing every year. These painters, sculptors, designers and musicians have shown to be well-informed on the latest scientific insights in synesthesia. They combine this scientific {{knowledge and}} personal intuition in a range of artistic expressions. For instance they capture their synesthetic perceptions in painting, photographs, <b>textile</b> <b>work,</b> and sculptures. Beside these ‘classical’ materials of making art, an even larger production of synesthesia-inspired works is noticed in the field of digital art (Campen 2007).|$|E

50|$|There {{was limited}} {{industry}} in Kranj {{until the late}} 19th century. Until this time, trade in agricultural products, livestock, and wood was economically most important. The Majdič Mill, which operated from 1874 until the Second World War, was an early industry, producing up to 70000 kg of milled products per day. A leather factory was established in 1875. Large-scale industrialization occurred after the First World War, starting with the founding of a rubber factory in 1921. The Jugo-Češka <b>textile</b> <b>works</b> was established in 1923. Additional <b>textile</b> <b>works</b> were established after this, making Kranj {{one of the most}} important centers of textile manufacturing in pre-war Yugoslavia.
