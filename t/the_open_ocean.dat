40|$|Microzooplankton grazing rate {{estimates}} by the dilution approach {{have recently been}} criticized as systematically biased {{in the direction of}} being overestimates of actual rates in nature, and particularly in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>oceans.</b> This argument is based on observed mortality responses of ciliated protozoa to reduced food in several coastal experiments and a global extrapolation which assumes that all grazing in all ocean systems scales to the abundance of ciliates. We suggest that these conclusions are unrealistic on several counts: they do not account for community differences in <b>open</b> <b>ocean</b> and coastal systems; they ignore experimental direct evidence supporting dilution rate estimates in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>oceans,</b> and they discount dilution effects on mortality as well as growth in multi-layered, open-ocean food webs.

40|$|On page 278 of this issue, Veron {{and colleagues}} at CNRS and at Bordeaux University report their studies of the difficult, complex matter of lead {{pollution}} in the uppermost layers of outer deep-water sediments in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is common knowledge that heavy-metal pollution prevails within near-shore ocean sediments, and it might therefore be thought that either positive or conclusive negative evidence for lead pollution in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>oceans</b> should also be readily found in pelagic sediments. But {{this is not the}} case: the processes that yield the pollution effects easily observable in coastal sediments also limit these effects from extending into <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>oceans.</b> Furthermore, mass-sedimentation rates in deep waters far from shore are so slight that there are serious difficulties in studying the very thin, uppermost, decades-old sediment layers involved, although pollution effects are enhanced by these small sedimentation rates. Such problems made investigators in the past reluctant to search for evidence of lead pollution effects in deep-ocean sediments...|$|R

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day.

Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>ocean.</b> They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E

5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon {{a feeding frenzy}} may occur.

5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{began as a}} subtropical cyclone over the central Atlantic and became a hurricane while moving westward toward the United States. Lili did not gain any additional strength before curving away from land and weakening into a tropical storm. After transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it made landfall in southeastern Newfoundland. Overall, the hurricane's effects on land were minimal, despite multiple tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Initial uncertainty in its track prompted some concern of a landfall in North Carolina, but it remained predominately over <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011 archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt {{excavating}} a dried-up lagoon {{known as}} Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces {{of an ancient}} harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>ocean.</b> Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles.
