40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 21, 2002 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Joint Advanced Missile Instrumentation (JAMI) {{program is}} {{integrating}} Global Positioning System (GPS) technology into missile telemetry systems. The weakest link {{appears to be}} the GPS antenna. The antenna on a missile is required to be flush mounted for aerodynamic reasons. Due to the missile’s tendency to roll, the antenna needs to be a multi-element omnidirectional antenna array. Therefore an antenna used on missiles is a wrap-around antenna since it will meet the flush mount and rolling requirements by giving omnidirectional coverage. JAMI has used readily available techniques for designing wrap-around <b>telemetry</b> <b>antennas</b> to develop a GPS wrap-around antenna and has discovered a major problem. The Phase Center of a wrap-around antenna tends to be a surface, not a point, and not necessarily at the centerline of the missile body.

The overall system noise temperature {{is referenced to}} radio star flux densities known within several tenths of a decibel. An independent determination of antenna gain must be made before computing system noise temperature and several methods are suggested. The preferred method uses celestial and receiving system parameters to compute gain; whereas a less desirable method requires an accurately known output level from a standard signal generator. Field test data, obtained at 136 MHz and 400 MHz in the NASA space tracking and data acquisition network (STADAN), demonstrates that antenna gain and system noise temperature can be determined with an accuracy of 1 db.
