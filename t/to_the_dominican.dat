5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code {{name for the}} United States' {{intervention}} in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic; the Belgian Ambassador <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic; sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, a 21.5 hectare plot of land in the Sulucan Hills of Sampaloc, Manila was donated by Francisca Bustamante Bayot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> fathers for the University's expansion outside Intramuros.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued at 0900UTC for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from Port-au-Prince <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> border. This advisory was upgraded {{the next morning}} to a {{tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch, and that night was further upgraded to a hurricane warning. The Haitian coastal authority advised all small craft to stay in port, while at Port-au-Prince, all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled. More than 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying areas and workers from World Vision again pre-positioned relief supplies.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{scholars}} have written that Honorius III {{was a member}} of the Savelli family and that the church and associated buildings formed part of the holdings of the Savelli, thereby explaining why Honorius III donated Santa Sabina <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans.</b> [...] In fact, Honorius III was not a Savelli. These scholars may have confused later Pope Honorius IV, who was a Savelli, and Honorius III. [...] In any case, the church was given over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> and it has since then served as their headquarters in Rome.|$|R

5|$|Roskilde Convent is on {{the site}} of the former St Catherine's Priory from the mid-13th century which belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> friars until it was {{dissolved}} after the Danish Reformation. A private manor house (Sortebrødregaard or Blackfriars Manor) was built on the site in 1565 which in 1699 became a convent for women of high rank, the first of its kind in Lutheran Denmark.

5|$|Soon {{after his}} return to France, Betances became the first {{secretary}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic's diplomatic mission to France, but virtually {{assumed the role of}} ambassador. He also became the commercial representative of the Dominican government in Paris, Bern and London. At one time Betances attempted to be a venture capital partner on a failed enterprise that attempted to commercialize the use of Samaná Bay to benefit the Dominican Republic, and also to prevent foreign interests (particularly the United States) from taking over the bay, which was considered a primary strategic geographical feature of Hispaniola, in both commercial and military terms.|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} from Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo (formerly Nojpetén) to Mérida, {{combined with the}} difficult terrain and the hostility of the natives led to the road from Yucatán falling {{into a state of}} disrepair. In 1701 Ursúa y Arezmendi realised that the road was in such a poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucatán. He wrote to the King of Spain, requesting that Petén be transferred from the jurisdiction of Yucatán to the Audiencia Real of Guatemala. In 1703 Ursúa's petition was granted, with the condition that the ecclesiastical authority over Petén would pass <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Order.|$|E
5|$|Gatineau, Saskatchewan, and Qu'Appelle {{were used}} to ferry Canadian troops back home before they were placed in reserve in 1946 and {{subsequently}} sold for scrap, although Gatineau was scuttled in 1948 in British Columbia {{to serve as a}} breakwater. Faulknor and Forester were reduced to reserve in 1945 and broken up the following year; Escapade lasted on active duty a year longer as she served in the Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla until 1946, but the ship was scrapped the next year. Unlike most of her sisters, Fame remained on active duty until 1947 when she was placed in reserve. She was sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic in 1949 and renamed Generalissimo. The ship was renamed Sanchez in 1962 and finally discarded in 1968. Navarinon later became a training ship before she was returned to the Royal Navy in 1956 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|Nova began a {{throwing}} {{program to}} rehabilitate {{his arm in}} September, and spent the winter at the Yankees' spring training facility in Tampa, Florida, rather than returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic. The Yankees signed Nova to a $3.3million contract for the 2015 season, avoiding arbitration. On April 11, 2015, the Yankees placed Nova on the 60-day disabled list to begin the season recovering from his Tommy John surgery. He made his first rehabilitation start on June 8, {{and returned to the}} Yankees on June 24. Nova pitched to a 5.11 ERA in 14 starts before the Yankees took him out of the starting rotation on September 16; however, Nova returned to the rotation due to an injury to Masahiro Tanaka. He finished the 2015 season with a 6–11 record and a 5.07 ERA.|$|E
50|$|Kilwardby crowned Edward I and {{his wife}} Eleanor as king and queen of England in August 1274, but {{otherwise}} took little part in politics.

50|$|In 1246, Doge Jacopo Tiepolo donated some swampland <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> after {{dreaming of}} a flock of white doves flying over it. The first church was {{demolished}} in 1333, when the current church was begun. It was not completed until 1430.|$|R
50|$|Aquinas University of Legazpi is {{the first}} Catholic University in Bicol Region run by <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Fathers/Order of Preachers.

5|$|Prior to the Act of Foundation, King Philip III granted, {{through the}} Governor-General, the {{permission}} {{to open a}} college in Manila. So in 1612, Fr. Domingo González, O.P., Lector of the Santo Domingo Convent, was appointed {{to work on the}} completion the organization of the college. In that same year, when classes also began, the Dominican Province of the Holy Rosary accepted the College, an act which amounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Order's assuming the responsibility in the operation of the institution. In 1619, in the name of King Philip IV, the Governor-General of the Philippines, gave his approval. The Holy See granted, although indirectly or implicitly, recognition to the new College in 1619. In 1627, Pope Urban VIII also authorized the College to confer academic degrees, so that the said academic degrees had both royal and papal approval. Although the College had only been in operation for a few years, records show that degrees were already being conferred in 1640.|$|E
5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{realized}} that Batista {{would lose the}} war, and fearing that Castro would displace U.S. interests with socialist reforms, decided to aid Batista's removal by supporting a rightist military junta, believing that General Cantillo, then commanding most of the country's armed forces, should lead it. After being approached with this proposal, Cantillo secretly met with Castro, agreeing that the two would call a ceasefire, following which Batista would be apprehended and tried as a war criminal. Double-crossing Castro, Cantillo warned Batista of the revolutionary's intentions. Wishing to avoid a tribunal, Batista resigned on 31 December 1958, informing the armed forces that they were now under Cantillo's control. With his family and closest advisers, Batista fled into exile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic with over US$ 300,000,000. Cantillo then entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new President, and began appointing new members of the government.|$|E

50|$|The {{fourth and}} the fifth letters were also written on May 26, 1323 and were {{addressed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Franciscan and <b>Dominican</b> Orders.

5|$|With two Landing Ship Docks, Boxer was {{dispatched}} to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a humanitarian mission to aid Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose infrastructure had {{been damaged by}} Hurricane Cleo. The ships provided medical aid and helped to evacuate civilians displaced by the storm. On 27 April 1965 Boxer returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a complement of Marines. They evacuated about 1,000 US nationals from {{the country in the}} wake of a revolution in the country. It was a part of Operation Powerpack which would eventually see the US occupation of that country. Later in 1965, she was used as a transport vessel for the Vietnam War. The carrier transported 200 helicopters of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second trip to Vietnam in early 1966 when she transported Marine Corps aircraft to South Vietnam. However, she did not participate in combat operations during that war.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> national debt, the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|Intervention in Latin America {{had been}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; Harding spoke against Wilson's decision to send U.S. troops <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic and Haiti, and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Franklin Roosevelt, {{for his role in}} the Haitian intervention. Once Harding was sworn in, Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention; at the time of Harding's inauguration, the U.S. also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua. The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921; U.S. forces remained in the other three nations through Harding's presidency. In April 1921, Harding gained the ratification of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty with Colombia, granting that nation $25,000,000 as settlement for the U.S.-provoked Panamanian revolution of 1903. The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied, as the U.S. refused to renounce interventionism, though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal and to make it clear what the U.S. aims were.|$|E

50|$|By 1244, {{seeing that}} all of her {{attempts}} to dissuade Thomas had failed, Theodora sought <b>to</b> save <b>the</b> family's dignity, arranging for Thomas to escape at night through his window.
