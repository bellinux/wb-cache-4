Heterophile also can mean {{that it is an}} antibody that reacts with antigens other than the antigen that stimulated it (an antibody that crossreacts).A 20% suspension of horse red cells is used in an isotonic 3-8% sodium citrate formulation.One drop of the patient’s serum to be tested is mixed on an opal glass slide with one drop of a particulate suspension of guinea-pig kidney stroma, and a suspension of ox red cell stroma; sera and suspensions are mixed with a wooden applicator 10 times. Ten micro liters of the horse red cell suspension are then added and mixed with each drop of adsorbed serum. The mixture is left undisturbed for one minute (not rocked or shaken).Examine for {{the presence or absence of}} red cell agglutination.If stronger with the sera adsorbed with guinea-pig kidney, the test is negative.If stronger with the sera adsorbed with ox red cell stroma, the test is positive.

5000|$|After {{passing the}} {{yellow fever virus}} through {{laboratory}} mice, Theiler found that the weakened virus conferred immunity on rhesus macaques. [...] The stage was set for Theiler to develop a vaccine against the disease. Theiler first devised a test for the efficacy of experimental vaccines. In his <b>test,</b> <b>sera</b> from vaccinated human subjects were injected into mice {{to see if they}} protected the mice against yellow fever virus. This “mouse protection test” was used with variations as a measure of immunity until after World War II. [...] Subculturing the particularly virulent Asibi strain from West Africa in chicken embryos, a technique pioneered by Ernest Goodpasture, the Rockefeller team sought to obtain an attenuated strain of the virus that would not kill mice when injected into their brains. It took until 1937, and more than 100 subcultures in chicken embryos, for Theiler and his colleague Hugh Smith to obtain an attenuated strain, which they named [...] "17D". Animal tests showed the attenuated 17D mutant was safe and immunizing. Theiler's team rapidly completed the development of a 17D vaccine, and the Rockefeller Foundation began human trials in South America. Between 1940 and 1947, the Rockefeller Foundation produced more than 28 million doses of the vaccine and finally ended yellow fever as a major disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The anti-HIV- 1 {{neutralizing}} antibody assay {{is widely}} used in AIDS vaccine research and other experimental and clinical studies. The vital dye staining method applied in the detection of anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibody {{has been used in}} many laboratories. However, the unknown factor(s) in sera or plasma affected cell growth and caused protection when the <b>tested</b> <b>sera</b> or plasma was continuously maintained in cell culture. In addition, the poor solubility of neutral red in medium (such as RPMI- 1640) also limited the use of this assay. Methods In this study, human T cell line C 8166 was used as host cells, and 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethyl- 2 -thiazolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) instead of neutral red was used as vital dye. In order to avoid the effect of the unknown factor(s), the <b>tested</b> <b>sera</b> or plasma was removed by a washout procedure after initial 3 – 6 h culture in the assay. Result This new assay eliminated the effect of the <b>tested</b> <b>sera</b> or plasma on cell growth, improved the reliability of detection of anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibody, and showed excellent agreement with the p 24 antigen method.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{conventional}} {{method used}} for subtyping of antibodies against avian influenza viruses is hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. However, the HI test is laborious and requires preparation of antigen from viable viruses {{that might be}} hazardous. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (B-ELISA) for detection of antibody of avian influenza of the H 7 subtype. The B-ELISA is fast and avoids the need to culture whole viruses. Methods: The B-ELISA was based on the reaction between a monoclonal antibody and a recombinant hemagglutinin protein purified from Escherichia coli. The specificity of the B-ELISA was determined by testing H 7 -negative field sera and the sensitivity of the B-ELISA was determined by testing sera collected from experimentally immunized chickens. Results: The specificity of the B-ELISA was found to be 97. 7 % when compared with the HI test. The sensitivity was found to vary with the HI titer of sera. A sensitivity of 100 % was achieved when <b>test</b> <b>sera</b> had HI titers >= 2 (7). The sensitivity dropped to 33 % and 20 % when <b>test</b> <b>sera</b> had HI titers of 26 and 25, respectively. Nearly all <b>test</b> <b>sera</b> with HI titers <= 2 (4) were scored negative by the B-ELISA.

They are compared with established neutrophil serological methods. Results Data from two recombinant antigen platforms and a method using human neutrophil antigens-expressing KY cells indicated high specificity. Two mixed cellular flow cytometric assays have the advantage of presenting native conformation of the human polymorphonuclear neutrophil antigenic epitopes.

Diagnostic sensitivity estimates were obtained by <b>testing</b> <b>sera</b> from 139 Indonesian buffaloes which had been found to be infected by parasitological tests. Diagnostic specificity was estimated by <b>testing</b> <b>sera</b> from 263 buffaloes living in Australia.

The four tests were further compared by calculation of post-test probabilities of infection for positive and negative test results using a range of prevalence values, and likelihood ratios. The results suggested that the CATT was the best test to 'rule-in' infection (i. e. the highest probability of infection in test-positive animals) and the IgG ELISA was the best test to 'rule-out' infection (i. e. the lowest probability of infection in test-negative animals) ...|$|R

40|$|Enterotoxaemia is an {{economically}} important disease of sheep, goats and calves. The disease affects mainly young animals aged between {{four to six}} months. Enterotoxaemia is caused by systemic effects of the epsilon toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium perfringens Type D. Due to almost certain death of affected animals, there is no form of treatment. The only practical means of controlling the occurrence of enterotoxaemia is to immunize animals through vaccination. The vaccine is prepared by toxoiding the bacterial culture filtrate, and contains a range of proteins {{in addition to the}} epsilon toxin. Batches of the vaccine are thus required to be tested for safety, efficacy and potency. The potency of the vaccines is currently tested with the in vivo mouse neutralisation test (MNT). However, due to ethical, economic and technical reasons, alternative in vitro assays are needed. In this study, an indirect cytometric bead immunoassay (I-CBA) was developed for use in vaccine potency testing and the results were compared with those obtained using an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) and the MNT. To investigate, three groups of eight guinea pigs were immunized with one of three different production batches of the enterotoxaemia vaccine. Guinea pig sera were collected prior to vaccination and at five weeks post-vaccination, and the sera of four guinea pigs per group were pooled to give six <b>test</b> <b>sera.</b> The levels of anti-epsilon toxin antibodies in the respective <b>test</b> <b>sera</b> were subsequently determined using MNT, I-ELISA and I-CBA. The I-CBA assay developed {{during the course of this}} study is based on coating of functional beads with purified epsilon toxin that serves to capture anti-epsilon toxin antibodies from the <b>test</b> <b>sera.</b> Following incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled anti-guinea pig IgG, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry and the anti-epsilon toxin antibody concentrations were extrapolated from a standard curve using linear curve fitting. Although the intra- and inter-assay variability was satisfactory, epsilon antitoxin levels of the guinea pig <b>test</b> <b>sera</b> determined by both the ICBA and I-ELISA tests were higher than that of the MNT assay which is accepted as the current “gold standard”. Moreover, in contrast to the MNT, all of the serum samples were identified as having antitoxin levels above the required minimum (i. e. not less than 5 U/ml). These results indicate that the respective in vitro tests in their current formats are not yet suitable alternatives to the in vivo MNT. The growing demand for a more humane, cost-effective and efficient method for testing the potency of enterotoxaemia vaccines, however, provides a strong impetus for further optimization and standardization of the I-CBA assay described in this study.
