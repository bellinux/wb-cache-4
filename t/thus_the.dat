5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and <b>thus</b> <b>the</b> only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and <b>thus</b> <b>the</b> atomic radius, which increases going down the group; <b>thus,</b> <b>the</b> volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. <b>Thus,</b> <b>the</b> trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
