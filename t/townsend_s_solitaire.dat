40|$|About forty people {{participated in}} the 1981 Fall Field Day, which was {{scheduled}} from noon Saturday 3 October to noon Sunday 4 October, but which was anticipated by early arrivals Friday and on Saturday morning. The weather was windy and cool, the skies overcast much of the time, with some rain Saturday afternoon, and Sunday morning overcast {{so that it was}} hard to get colors. But almost as soon as the meeting broke up Sunday noon the sky cleared and everybody went home in bright sunshine. There was a slide show Saturday night. Of the reports on unusual species, submitted in accordance with the reporting form project adopted at the annual meeting (NBR 49 : 21), the Black-legged Kittiwake (NBR 49 : 41 - 42) was selected as the most unusual. The site was the 4 -H Camp, Nebraska National Forest, Halsey. Sixty-four species were reported from the Forest or immediately adjacent to it (compared to 71 at the 1980 Fall Field Day) : Double-crested Cormorant, Great Blue Heron, White-fronted Goose, Pintail, Wood Duck; Sharp-shined, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s, Red-tailed, and Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Hawks; Golden Eagle, Marsh Hawk; Prairie and Peregrine Falcons: American Kestrel, Sharp-tailed Grouse, Ring-necked Pheasant, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull; Rock and Mourning Doves; Great Horned and Short-eared Owls; Poor-will, Chimney Swift, Belted Kingfisher, Common Flicker (both forms); Hairy and Downy Woodpeckers; Barn Swallow, Blue Jay, Black-billed Magpie, Common Crow, Black-capped Chickadee; White-breasted and Red-breasted Nuthatches; American Robin, Hermit Thrush, Eastern Bluebird, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Solitaire,</b> Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Cedar Waxwing; Orange-crowned, Yellow-rumped, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers; Western Meadowlark, Common Grackle, Cardinal, Evening Grosbeak, House Finch, Pine Siskin, American Goldfinch, Red Crossbill, Rufous-sided Towhee; Vesper and Lark Sparrows; Dark-eyed Junco; Tree, Chipping, Clay-colored, Field, Harris 2 ̆ 7, White-crowned, White-throated, Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s, and Song Sparrows.

40|$|Aims:  To {{compare the}} {{susceptibility}} of a 3 -day-old biofilm and planktonic Salmonella to disinfectants at different exposure times. We hypothesize that Salmonella biofilms are more resilient to disinfectants compared to planktonic Salmonella. Methods and Results:  The susceptibility of planktonic cells to disinfectants was tested by {{a modified version}} of the Council of Europe suspension test EN 1276. Salmonella biofilms were formed using the Calgary Biofilm Device. Results show that 3 -day-old Salmonella biofilms are less susceptible to the disinfectants benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine gluconate, citric acid, quaternary ammonium compounds, sodium hypochlorite (SH) and ethanol, compared to planktonic Salmonella. Surprisingly, the results also demonstrate that low concentrations of SH were more effective against a 3 -day-old biofilm compared to high concentrations of SH. Conclusions:  While all the disinfectants evaluated were able to reduce biofilm-associated cells at concentrations and contact times sufficient to eliminate planktonic cells, there were still sufficient viable cells remaining in the biofilm to cause further contamination and potential infection. Significance and Impact of the Study:  Protocols for the use of chemical disinfectants need to include biofilm susceptibility testing. There is a requirement for an effective and standardized tool for determining the susceptibility of biofilms to disinfectants. H. S. Wong, K. M. <b>Townsend,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Fenwick, R. D.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{components}} of the Nebraska Bird Review since its inception has been the annual spring migration and occurrence report, and in more recent years the fall occurrence report has become equally important. Yet, other than an uncompleted effort by W. F. Rapp, Jr. to summarize the first 25 years of spring migration data, these records apparently have not been analyzed by anyone. Part {{of the problem is}} the sheer mass of data to be assimilated, and a second issue is {{the question of how to}} classify certain species, for the analysis of a winter visitor required different consideration from that of a spring and fall migrant. Further confusing the question is the fact that many Nebraska species migrate completely out of the state in some years but variably overwinter at other times. Even more difficult are the species that are summer residents in one part of the state, but may be winter visitors elsewhere, such as Townsend 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Solitaires.</b> Finally there are the problems of several species that are so little known that is it presently impossible to classify them as summer residents, permanent residents, or migrants. Nevertheless, these are a very small proportion of the total, and it thus seemed worthwhile to made an attempt at an understanding of the migration patterns of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s avifauna by the present analysis and perhaps pinpoint if not resolve some of these questions.

40|$|Accepted {{manuscript}} online: 15 DEC 2015 Information on fracture biomechanics {{has implications}} in materials research and clinical practice. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the influence of non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL) size, restorative status and direction of occlusal loading on the biomechanical behavior of mandibular premolars, using finite element analysis (FEA), strain gauge tests and fracture resistance tests. Ten buccal cusps were loaded on the outer and inner slopes to calculate the strain generated cervically. Data were collected for healthy teeth at baseline and progressively at three lesion depths (0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 5 mm), followed by restoration with resin composite. The magnitude and distribution of von Mises stress and maximum principal stress were simulated at all stages using FEA, and fracture strength was also determined (n = 7 per group). There were significant effects of the lesion size and loading directions on stress, strain and fracture resistance (p< 0. 05). Fracture resistance values decreased with increase in lesion size, but returned to baseline with restorations. Combined assessment of computer-based and experimental techniques provide an holistic approach to characterize the biomechanical behaviour of teeth with both unrestored and restored NCCLs.
