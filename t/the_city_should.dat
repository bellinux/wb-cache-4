5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency to do it on its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>should</b> build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{politics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to abortion in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>should</b> it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E

5|$|In October 1024, Salih's forces, led by Ibn Tawq, {{advanced}} against Aleppo {{and fought}} in sporadic engagements with the Fatimid troops of governors Thu'ban and Mawsuf. Salih himself arrived at Aleppo—after having sacked several coastal districts—with {{large numbers of}} Bedouin warriors on 22 November. He besieged the city, first camping outside of Bab al-Jinan, where his demand that Ibn Abi Usama, the city's qāḍī (head Islamic judge), and other notables surrender was refused. Salih then gathered more troops and engaged Aleppo's defenders for over fifty days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On 18 January 1025, the Bab Qinnasrin gate was opened to Salih by Salim ibn al-Mustafad, head of the city's surviving Hamdanid ghilmān; Ibn Mustafad had defected from the Fatimids after a quarrel with Mawsuf, and together with numerous townsmen and other former ghilmān, he welcomed Salih, who granted the inhabitants safe conduct. Afterward, Salih had the towers of the city's walls demolished, according to the Egyptian contemporary chronicler, al-Musabbihi, leading the local populace to believe Salih was preparing to hand over Aleppo to the Byzantines; fearing this, they fought alongside Fatimid troops and temporarily ousted Salih's forces, killing some 250 Kilabi warriors. Zakkar views Salih's destruction of Aleppo's walls as a tactical move to enable an easier reconquest of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>should</b> his troops have been ousted.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War {{began in}} September 1939, Hill was {{recalled}} to his regiment and given {{command of the}} 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers' advance party when the battalion left for France during the same month. The battalion {{was assigned to the}} 12th Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Infantry Division. He then commanded a platoon for several months, when the battalion was stationed along the Maginot Line, before being promoted to the rank of Captain in January 1940 and joining the staff at Allied Headquarters. The Battle of France began in May 1940, by which time Hill was attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort; during this period he was involved in planning the evacuation of the civilian population of Brussels, and also carried Gort's dispatches to Calais ordering the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At the end of the campaign, he took command of the evacuation of the beach at La Panne, and was on the last destroyer to leave Dunkirk. For these actions, he was awarded the Military Cross. On his return to Britain, he was promoted to Major and travelled to Dublin in the Irish Free State, where he planned for the evacuation of British citizens from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>should</b> German forces land there. When this task was completed, he volunteered for the fledgling Parachute Regiment, part of the British Army's growing airborne forces, and undertook parachute training; when the 1st Parachute Battalion was formed on 15 August 1941, he was appointed as its second-in-command.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, the {{colorful}} mayor of New York City, Fernando Wood, {{was a prominent}} early supporter of the Confederate cause.

New York City had many economic and financial ties to the South; by 1820, half of its exports were related to cotton, and upstate textile mills processed Southern cotton.

25|$|Proponents of this {{position}} {{argue that the}} devastation from firebombing was greater than {{anything that could be}} justified by military necessity alone, and this establishes a prima facie case.

Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>should</b> have precluded the Allies from bombing it.|$|E
