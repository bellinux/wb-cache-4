5|$|A year passes, with Amy and Rory {{periodically}} travelling {{with the}} Doctor. Brian, after observing Amy and Rory returning from one trip, asks the Doctor {{what has happened}} to his past companions. The Doctor tells some had met a sad fate but he will not let <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Amy or Rory. Humanity forgets about the cubes, using them as paperweights or other functions.|$|E
5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media. Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely {{in proportion to}} the things <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)â€”the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of Neptune has {{a profound effect}} on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|E

25|$|Medawar's {{theory is}} {{referred}} to as Mutation Accumulation. The mechanism of action involves random, detrimental germline mutations of a kind <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> show their effect only late in life. Unlike most detrimental mutations, these would not be efficiently weeded out by natural selection. Hence they would 'accumulate' and, perhaps, cause all the decline and damage that we associate with ageing.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s, a close {{relationship}} was assumed between the Ichthyosauria and the Sauropterygia, another marine reptile group, within an overarching Euryapsida. Today, however, this is usually rejected, with the Euryapsida being seen as an unnatural polyphyletic assemblage of reptiles <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> share some adaptations to a swimming lifestyle. An exception {{is a study in}} 1997 by John Merck, which showed monophyletic archosauromorph euryapsids.|$|E

25|$|The anthropic {{principle}} is a philosophical consideration that {{observations of the}} Universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the {{anthropic principle}} reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a Primary Urban Area was created {{in an attempt to}} enable {{economic}} and social comparisons between cities using definitions less arbitrary than the administrative boundaries of local authorities, but avoiding one problem of using the Urban Areas defined by the Office for National Statistics - that sprawling conurbations such as the West Yorkshire Urban Area, containing multiple distinct settlements with large degrees of physical and social independence, but <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> touch, end up being treated as if they were a single city.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{examined}} specific subgroups of Mormon women. A study by Ann Pritt in 1998 found that Mormon women who were sexually abused {{were more likely to}} feel distant from God, blame themselves for bad things <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them, and be more pessimistic in general compared to Mormon women who were not sexually abused (with both parties having received counseling at some point). Another study by Jacobsen and Wright in 2014 found that Mormon women who experience same-sex attraction feel isolation and worthlessness and need to form a positive self-identity.|$|E

25|$|Last but not least, Nygard {{discusses}} the idea {{put forward by}} Sophus Bugge that the story itself descends from the biblical tale of Judith and Holofernes. But, among other objections, Nygard points out that Holofernes didn't intend to kill Judith - he wanted sex with her - and hadn't murdered a succession of other maidens either, yet those murders {{seem to be at}} the heart of the ballad. He points out too that Bugge cherry-picks details occurring only in widely scattered variants <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> fit with his biblical theory.|$|E
25|$|Since slembingur.org is hosted on {{a shared}} web hosting service, and the block {{takes the form}} of a null route any other sites <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> share the same IP address are also blocked.

As of 8 February 2011, slembingur.org had changed IP addresses and is therefore no longer blocked by Vodafone. The null route is still in place, so collateral damage is the only result from this incident.|$|E
25|$|This crude {{approach}} {{results in}} the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the reverberation effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen {{the development of new}} techniques based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.|$|E

25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E
