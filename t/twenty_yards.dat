A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to <b>twenty</b> <b>yards</b> at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E

25|$|Rodgers dodged another Stanford {{player and}} took the ball to his right, {{toward the middle of}} the field, where at least four other Cal players were ready for the next pitch. Around the Stanford 45, Rodgers pitched the ball to Mariet Ford, who caught it in stride. Meanwhile, the Stanford band, all 144 members, had run out past the south end zone—the one the Cal players were trying to get to—and had {{advanced}} as far as <b>twenty</b> <b>yards</b> downfield.

25|$|When {{the start}} and finish {{positions}} of the Old Course had become established, {{the distance between them}} was found to be 1 mile 570 yds (2131 metres). However, boats were aligned by their sterns at {{the start and}} judged by their bows at the finish. This meant that the course was slightly longer for single sculls than for eights. The length of an eight was assumed to be <b>twenty</b> <b>yards</b> and as such the course came to be described as ‘about 1 mile and 550 yards (2112 metres)’, which was the distance covered by an eight.|$|E

25|$|In September 1745, {{during the}} Jacobite rising of 1745, the {{advancing}} Jacobite army of Prince Charles Edward Stuart was heading towards Edinburgh, {{but in order}} to get there had to pass by Stirling Castle which was being held by British-Hanoverian forces under the command of Major General William Blakeney. On 14 September the Jacobites squeezed through the space between the extremity of the Touch Hills and the castle rock, bringing them within range of Blakeney’s artillery. Blakeney opened fire at the Jacobite’s white flag hoping to hit the Chevalier (Stuart) himself, but the bullet landed about <b>twenty</b> <b>yards</b> from him. He fired four times but without success, the cannon being only a 6-pounder and at a distance of a mile and a half. The people of Stirling then emerged to watch the Jacobites pass through St. Ninians {{on the far side of}} the narrows. The Prince and the Jacobites had at that time no intention of conflict with the Red coats in Stirling Castle and instead had their sights set firmly on Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{started the}} fourth quarter with a new quarterback, Mickey Ellenburg, who then led the Gators {{into the end zone}} with a 14-yard pass to Perry McGriff, tying the game at 7–7. LSU {{received}} the kickoff and were forced to punt shortly after. Florida again began a drive down the field but were intercepted by Cannon at the LSU 18-yard line, who then lateraled to Hendrix, who ran it down to LSU's 40. Rabb completed a pass to Brodnax and Cannon rushed four times for <b>twenty</b> <b>yards</b> to get LSU within eight yards of the end zone. After two incomplete passes by Rabb, Cannon tried a run up the middle, but was stopped by Heckman for a one-yard gain to bring up fourth down. Dietzel then allowed the play clock to run down and took a five-yard delay of game penalty to give Tommy Davis a better angle for a field goal attempt. From the 19-yard line, Davis stepped back and kicked it through the uprights to give LSU a 10–7 lead with 2:59 left in the game. Florida was unable to score on its final possession.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{game that}} proved to be a harder {{challenge}} than many expected, South Carolina took Auburn down to the wire before the Tiger defense stepped up at the end. An offensive battle took place as neither defense could stop the opposing offense. Each team only punted once during the game and when South Carolina punted Quan Bray fumbled on the return and the ball was recovered by South Carolina. That was the Tigers' only turnover of the game. South Carolina turned the ball over three times (all interceptions) including one inside the <b>twenty</b> <b>yard</b> line, and two in the end zone, which included one on the hail mary attempt as time expired. Cassanova McKinzy had one interception and Jonathan Jones had two interceptions. The Tigers had won a shootout 42-35.
