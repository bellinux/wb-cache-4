5|$|In May 1920 Princess Matoika took {{on board}} the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the Kiel Canal and picked up 1,600U.S. {{residents}} of Polish descent at Danzig, {{all of whom had}} enlisted in the Polish Army {{at the outset of the}} war. Also included among the passengers were 500U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at Koblenz. The ship arrived at New York on 23May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed by families were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On 21 July, Princess Matoika arrived in New York after a similar voyage with 25war brides, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 steerage passengers, and the remains of 881soldiers. In between these two trips, the Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Baron Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, sailed from New York to Belgium {{on board the}} Matoika. It was, however, Princess Matoikas next trip to Belgium <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> infamous.|$|E
5|$|Maya cities {{tended to}} expand haphazardly, {{and the city}} centre would be {{occupied}} by ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways. The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces, pyramid-temples, ceremonial ballcourts, and structures aligned for astronomical observation. The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> advanced in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on stelae and ceramics. The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included {{one of the earliest}} instances of the explicit zero in the world. As a part of their religion, the Maya practised human sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} first {{identified}} in rodents collected in 2004 {{as part of}} a survey of wild mammals at Playa de Oro in Manzanillo, Colima, western Mexico. The discovery was published in 2008 by Yong-Kyu Chu and colleagues. Among 600 small mammals, antibodies against the hantavirus Sin Nombre virus were found in 23 individuals (out of 358 studied) of Oryzomys couesi, a rice rat <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common species found, six (out of 87) of the cotton rat Sigmodon mascotensis, and one (out of 77) of the pygmy mouse Baiomys musculus. In addition, twelve O.couesi and one S.mascotensis yielded hantavirus RNA. Viruses were found in males more often than in females. Because the amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of the virus's genome differed by as much as 7 to 10% from closely related hantaviruses, Chu and colleagues identified the virus found at Playa de Oro as a new species, called Playa de Oro virus or OROV. Although the authors could not prove that the virus fulfilled all the criteria for identifying a new virus species, they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria. It is currently treated as a probable species in the Hantavirus genus.|$|E

Among European cities, Córdoba under the Caliphate, with a population of perhaps 500,000, eventually overtook Constantinople as the largest and most prosperous city in Europe. Within the Islamic world, Córdoba was one of the leading cultural centres. The work of its most important philosophers and scientists (notably Abulcasis and Averroes) had a major influence on the intellectual life of medieval Europe.|$|E

In 1983, while playing in a game with the Greek national team against the North Carolina Tar Heels at Chapel Hill, Greece's shooting guard Galis, while being guarded by North Carolina's shooting guard Michael Jordan, scored 50 points during the game. He played in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, where he led all players in scoring average with 33.5 points per game. In that tournament, he had a 53-point outburst against the Panamanian national basketball team.|$|E
25|$|Related to {{the rose}} cut, and of similar antiquity, is the mogul cut, {{named after the}} Great Mogul diamond <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous example of its type. Like the classic rose cut, the mogul cut also lacks a {{pavilion}} and a table facet, and its crown is also composed of triangular facets rising to form a point. But in mogul-cut diamonds the rotational symmetry is normally fourfold or eightfold, and the eight apical facets are girded by two or more additional rings of facets. The modern mogul cut evolved from earlier faceting techniques originally used to disguise internal flaws in very large stones; in the modern day this cut has also become rare, but still finds occasional use where it is less important to showcase a stone's internal clarity, as with the black and internally opaque Spirit of de Grisogono Diamond.|$|E

In the 5-3-1 point distribution scheme based on the ballots of 18 voters, Crosby had nine first-place votes, five second-place votes, and three third-place votes, while Kessel had seven first-place votes, eight second-place votes, and one third-place vote.|$|E

25|$|In February the British {{government}} {{planned to}} send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed {{the arrival of}} an infantry battalion until 15 May and a second battalion until 12 July. The French in Djibouti were asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that the effort of invading British Somaliland would act as a deterrent and that Djibouti {{would be a more}} tempting target. When the French in French Somaliland rallied to Vichy after the French armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany, The Officer Commanding, Troops in British Somaliland, Brigadier Arthur Reginald Chater RM, was ordered to make a contingency plan for an evacuation if the colony became untenable. By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment (1st NRR), the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (4 × 3.7-inch howitzers) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment from the Colony of Aden and the lightly armed Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment. On 8 August the 2nd Battalion Black Watch arrived. The garrison was a motley group with no proper base or headquarters and was short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence.
