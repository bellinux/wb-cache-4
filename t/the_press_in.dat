5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should {{catch up with the}} presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>in</b> camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> <b>In</b> 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served to put the Society in a bad light. The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} how {{directly}} Offenbach influenced Johann Strauss. He had encouraged Strauss to turn to operetta when they met in Vienna in 1864, {{but it was not until}} seven years later that Strauss did so. However, Offenbach's operettas were well established in Vienna, and Strauss worked on the lines established by his French colleague; in 1870s Vienna, an operetta composer who did not do so was quickly called to order by <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> <b>In</b> Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model.|$|E

5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings.

Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>in</b> the era of communist Poland.
