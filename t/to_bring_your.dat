[...] According to Ron Rozelle, [...] "...the success of your story or novel will depend on many things, but the most crucial is your ability <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> reader into it. [...] And that reader will be most completely in when you deliver the actual sensations of the many things that comprise your story" [...] As stated by [...] Jessica Page Morrell, [...] "You breathe life into fiction by translating the senses onto the page, producing stories rooted {{in the physical world}} ... that creates a tapestry, a galaxy of interwoven sensory ingredients." ...|$|E

2500|$|D. H. Lawrence took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in {{the final}} book he wrote, Apocalypse. He saw the {{language}} which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called [...] "the sovereignty of the intellect" [...] which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled [...] "vulgarity" [...] {{and that was what}} he found in Revelation. [...] "It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation." ...|$|E

Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> way.
