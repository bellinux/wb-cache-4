40|$|This study {{evaluated}} two half-cell mapping {{methods for}} nondestructive evaluation of epoxy-coated rebar (ECR) in concrete: the semi-fixed bi-electrode and the moving bi-electrode methods. These methods {{were expected to}} provide early detection of corrosion-related damage and ensure adequate time for repair. The techniques were evaluated by comparing the half-cell measurements using the two half-cell mapping techniques and measurements using the standard half-cell technique. The study found that in concrete specimens the response of both bi-electrode techniques {{was similar to that}} of the standard half-cell technique. Each technique was sensitive enough to distinguish between ponded and unponded regions along the <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> beams. Although additional research is required to determine exactly how sensitive either bi-electrode technique is for assessing corrosion of ECR in concrete, it is clear that the use of any nondestructive tool for condition surveys of bridge decks would benefit VDOT and Virginia. The author recommends that the <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> beams used in this study continue to be ponded until corrosion is initiated to aid in understanding the benefit of using the two bi-electrode methods during the various stages of corrosion.

This effect study aims at providing additional information using modelling, technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness analysis based on the latest available data. Upon request of DG-GROW (Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs), the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) undertook a pre-study and the phase 1 of the effect study. The phase 1 includes the stocktaking of L-category vehicles and data mining of their <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> values (tailpipe emissions after a cold-start, prescribed driving cycle), which are presented in the present report. From the stocktaking collected, {{it was found that}} very scarce data related to other L-categories than two-wheel moped (L 1 e) and motorcycle (L 3 e) are currently available. In addition, data originating from different sources (e. g., manufacturers and EUROSTAT) displayed noticeable differences in terms of vehicle stock (up to 8 %) and new registration, in particular for L 1 e category. A source of harmonized stocktaking data are required to ensure reliable model projections, and guarantee unbiased cost-benefit analysis. From the datamining on <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> values from L-category vehicles, the overview was achieved for actual L 1 e, L 3 e, powered tricycle (L 5 e) and heavy quadricycle (L 7 e) based on data collected from the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA). It was found that L 1 e was the category displaying the highest share of models with <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> values lower than Euro 4 emission limits, followed by the L 3 e and the L 5 e categories (63 %, 8 %, and 7 % respectively). In addition, the L 3 e and the L 5 e categories presented models already complying with Euro 5 standards. Finally, the L 7 e category displayed models complying neither with Euro 4, nor Euro 5 standards. Therefore, among the L-categories studied in this report, L 7 e may have to undertake a significant effort to comply with the foreseen Euro 4 and Euro 5 standard. JRC.

40|$|The {{studies on}} {{acoustic}} emission characteristics of cemented waste of rock backfills with two different structures during creep process {{were carried out}} by virtue of short-term creep test under different stress levels. The results show that: When {{two parts of the}} stone combinations in the test specimens are combined in a minor angle (30 °~ 60 °) (type I), under sustained loading without failure, acoustic emission amplitude will increase during steady creep stage with surface crack opening and propagating. When two parts of the stone combinations in the test specimens are combined in a large angle (60 °~ 90 °) (type II), under sustained loading without failure, the test specimens show two varied features. On one hand, acoustic emission amplitude will decrease significantly during steady creep stage, with surface crack opening and propagating which will mainly occur during decelerated creep stage. On the other hand, acoustic emission amplitude is rather fluctuating during sustained load stage which leads to separation and drop of parts of the test specimen. One common trait of these two types of test specimens is that, the whole decelerated creep and steady creep stages show relatively stable acoustic emission amplitude before destruction.

40|$|Waste rock is a {{potential}} source of low quality drainage resulting from oxidation of naturally occurring sulfide minerals. Sulfide oxidation may result in the generation of effluent with elevated concentrations of SO 4 and dissolved metals and low pH. The sulfide content of waste rock is typically much {{lower than that of}} tailings; however, the large volumes of waste rock produced during mining may create a large environmental liability. Improving the understanding of the processes affecting the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD) from waste rock will facilitate improved prediction, mitigation, and remediation strategies. Three waste-rock test piles were constructed at the Diavik Diamond Mine, Northwest Territories to investigate the potential for AMD generation in a permafrost environment. The test piles were constructed in 2006 and consisted of low sulfide (0. 035 wt. % S), high sulfide (0. 53 wt. % S), and covered test piles. The covered test pile was constructed to model the mine closure plan and consisted of a high sulfide (0. 082 wt. %) core, covered by a low-permeability layer, and a low-sulfide thermal insulation layer. In 2014, the low-sulfide <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> pile was systematically deconstructed to investigate the geochemical, hydrogeological, and geotechnical evolution of the waste rock. Samples were collected for microbial community analysis, mineralogical characterization, pore-water extraction, ice distribution, volumetric moisture content, and particle-size distribution. The geochemical evolution of the test pile was investigated using mineral saturation index calculations, neutralization potential ratios, aqueous geochemistry, most probable number enumeration, adsorption isotherm modeling within the test pile, and mass loading calculations at the basal drain. Regions of low pH with elevated dissolved metal and SO 4 concentration developed within the test pile {{as a result of the}} heterogeneity inherent in the waste rock. Sulfide oxidation rates were depressed in regions that remained frozen for a larger part of the year. Depression of sulfide oxidation rates allowed neutralization reactions within the waste rock to maintain circumneutral pH in these regions. Saturation index calculations indicate circumneutral pH regions were conducive to precipitation of Fe (oxy) hydroxides which have a large capacity to adsorb cations. Adsorption isotherm modeling indicates that adsorption of Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni on ferrihydrite can account for the observed attenuation of these metals with increasing pH.

40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} studies were {{completed}} {{to characterize the}} geochemistry and microbiology of drainage emanating from low-S content waste-rock test piles at the Diavik Diamond Mine (Diavik) from 2007 through 2010. The potential use of small-scale laboratory humidity-cell experiments to predict the water quality from larger-scale field-based experiments also was examined. Waste rock at Diavik is segregated into three categories according to sulfide content: Type I (target concentration: 0. 08 wt. % S). Four high-density polyethylene tanks, 2 m in diameter by 2 m in height, were filled with and surrounded by waste rock (active zone lysimeters; AZLs) at the Diavik site to study the upper 2 m of the active zone within a waste-rock pile and to evaluate the quality of effluent released from waste rock with differing S contents (Type I AZLs: 0. 014 wt. % S and Type III AZLs: 0. 035 wt. % S). In addition, three waste-rock test piles also were constructed at Diavik, two uncovered test piles (<b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> pile: 0. 035 wt. % S and Type III test pile: 0. 053 wt. % S) and a third pile was constructed based on the mine-closure plan which consists of waste rock (Type III: 0. 082 wt. % S) capped with a 1. 5 m layer of till and a 3 m layer of Type I material (Covered test pile). Each test pile is underlain by a high-density polyethylene geomembrane that captures and directs water to outflow drains. Results show that the release and transport of blasting residuals {{could be used as}} a resident tracer, indicating the first flush of water through the AZLs and the test piles. Variations in concentrations of blasting residuals and the gradual rate of dissipation provide an indication of the heterogeneity of the distribution of blasting residuals and the relative contributions of water and solutes from different flow paths. As temperatures within the test piles increase in response to ambient air temperature increases, larger proportions of the test pile contributed to the outflow, and increased concentrations of blasting residuals were observed in waste-rock test pile effluent. Effluent from the Type I AZLs and test pile maintained near-neutral pH (ranged from 5. 8 to 8) with concentrations of SO₄²⁻ 1500 mg L⁻¹) suggesting sulfide oxidation was occurring. Maximum concentrations of SO₄²⁻, Al, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu were observed in 2009 during the first flush of water through the Type III test pile. A sequence of acid-neutralization reactions was inferred based on the water chemistry of the effluent derived from the Type III AZLs and waste-rock test pile. This acid-neutralization sequence is similar to those observed at other AMD impacted sites. A series of mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions controlled pH and metal mobility; carbonate-mineral dissolution consumed H⁺ generated from sulfide-mineral oxidation at near neutral pH and the dissolution of Al and Fe (oxy) hydroxides consumed H⁺ at pH < 5. 0. The cover system on the Covered test pile dampened the effects of ambient air temperature on the internal temperatures within the core of the Covered test pile. As a result, the Covered test pile had a relatively steady change in flow rate, with decreased flow from June to August, which led to a slow but prolonged release of sulfide-mineral oxidation products, such as SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals, including Ni, Co, Zn, Cd, and Cu, compared to the uncovered Type III test pile. The pH decreased in 2008 and remained low for the duration of the study, whereas the pH in the uncovered test pile was near-neutral at the beginning of each field season in May and decreased to < 4. 2 by the end of the field season in November. The microbiological-community profiles observed in the AZLs and waste-rock test piles suggest typical AMD-related species were present in acidic effluent with elevated concentrations of metals, whereas typical soil microbes were present in effluent with a near-neutral pH and lower concentrations of SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals. The Type III AZLs, Type III test pile, and Covered test pile maintained populations of acidophilic Fe-oxidizers, whereas, the Type I AZLs and <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>test</b> pile maintained populations of neutrophilic S-oxidizers. Laboratory humidity-cell (1 kg) results were scaled up to estimate the water quality from the Type III AZLs (6 t) using measured physical and chemical parameters. The results suggested over-prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations when low mean annual precipitation occurred, limiting flushing of predicted oxidation products. In subsequent years with higher mean annual precipitation oxidation products from previous years were liberated and resulted in the under prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations. Additionally, Fe and Al were over-predicted because Fe and Al concentrations in the AZL effluent may be controlled by the solubility and formation of secondary minerals, such as Fe oxyhydroxides, jarosite, and goethite, which were not included in the scaling procedure...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to provide the {{underground}} coal mining industry {{with an understanding of}} what governs if an explosive is classed as permitted, a preliminary research project was undertaken to investigate the scientific basis of the British Health and Safety Executives Testing Memorandum# 2 (TM 2). Previous literature indicates that the TM 2 standard is empirical and based on comparative testing of the explosive in use at the time, nitroglycerine. Eighty <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out and preliminary findings were that the mechanism that causes ignition is a reflected shockwave which compresses and reheats detonation products. The origin of the reflected pressure wave changed when the primer position was altered within the cannon. With a pressure transducer and pyrometer mounted {{on the side of the}} gallery the measurements aided in identifying those maximum pressures and temperatures prior to ignition that are collectively a set of parameters that could be used to identify if an explosive would cause an ignition in the gallery. Additionally numerical modelling was employed to characterise pressure, temperature and velocity profiles within the gallery for blown out and cut off shots. Whilst the pressure and temperature results predicted by the CFD model were 1. 5 to 3 times the magnitude of those measured in the field, the modelling results exhibited the behaviour of the shockwaves reflecting off the gallery walls, rebounding, gaining intensity and travelling back towards the centre axis of the gallery. This predicted behaviour reinforced the belief that re-heating of detonation gases by reflected shockwaves is the prime ignition mechanism of the <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> TM 2 <b>tests.</b> One hundred and eight deflagration tests were conducted in the Type II cannon. The main finding was that the longer a receptor is subjected to elevated pressures due to confinement the higher the probability of deflagration.

An unanticipated case was suggested, however, upon finding two types of metronidazole (Mtz) -susceptible strains: <b>type</b> <b>I,</b> in which frxA (which encodes a nitroreductase that contributes to Mtz susceptibility) is quiescent, and type II, in which frxA is well expressed. Here we report that inactivation of the fdxA ferredoxin gene (hp 277) in <b>type</b> <b>I</b> strains resulted in high-level frxA expression (in effect, making them type II). However, fdxA null derivatives were obtained from only 6 of 32 <b>type</b> <b>I</b> strains <b>tested</b> that were readily transformed with an frxA::aphA marker. This suggested that fdxA is often essential.

With type II strains, in contrast, fdxA null derivatives were obtained in 20 of 23 cases tested. Thus, fdxA is dispensable in most strains that normally exhibit (and tolerate) strong frxA expression.

As SIT is thought to cause a shift towards Th 1 dominance, we hypothesized that SIT would alter interferon <b>type</b> <b>I</b> signaling. To <b>test</b> this, allergen and diluent challenged CD 4 + T cells from healthy controls and patients from different time points were analyzed. The initial experiments focused on signature genes of the pathway and found complex changes following immunotherapy, which were consistent with our hypothesis. As interferon signaling involves multiple genes, expression profiling studies were performed, showing altered expression of the pathway. These findings require validation in a larger group of patients in further studies. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{thrombotic}} and thromboembolic occlusion of atherosclerotic {{vessels are}} events that precipitate most {{heart attacks and}} strokes. In arterial stenotic flow, thrombus formation is shear dependent and {{may or may not}} lead to complete occlusion of the vessel. Platelets in whole blood adhere to collagen-coated surfaces and as they accumulate the resistance of the stenosis increases because of the decreasing passageway of the occluded stenosis. As a model of blood clotting in stenoses, porcine blood is heparinized and perfused over tubular glass test sections that are coated with collagen <b>type</b> <b>I.</b> Each <b>test</b> section has a preexisting stenosis and its severity varies so that higher percent stenoses produce higher shear rates on the blood. The hypothesis of this thesis is that high shear rates due to stenosis in arteries are a necessary feature for occlusive thrombosis. M. S. Committee Chair: Dr. David N.

40|$|CD 95 <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and II cells {{differ in}} their {{dependence}} on mitochondria to execute apoptosis, because antiapoptotic members of the Bcl- 2 family render only type II cells resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis. They can also be distinguished by a more efficient formation of the death-inducing signaling complex in <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells. We have identified a soluble form of CD 95 ligand (S 2) that is cytotoxic to type II cells but does not kill <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells. By <b>testing</b> 58 tumor cell lines of the National Cancer Institute's anticancer drug-screening panel for apoptosis sensitivity to S 2 and performing death-inducing signaling complex analyses, we determined {{that half of the}} CD 95 -sensitive cells are <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and half are type II. Most of the <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cell lines fall into a distinct class of tumor cells expressing mesenchymal-like genes, whereas the type II cell lines preferentially express epithelium-like markers. This suggests that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and II tumor cells represent different stages of carcinogenesis that resemble the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. We then screened the National Cancer Institute database of > 42, 000 compounds for reagents with patterns of growth inhibition that correlated with either <b>type</b> <b>I</b> or <b>type</b> II cell lines and found that actin-binding compounds selectively inhibited growth of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells, whereas tubulin-interacting compounds inhibited growth of type II cells. Our analysis reveals fundamental differences in programs of gene expression between <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II cells and could impact the way actin- and microtubule-disrupting antitumor agents are used in tumor therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this work, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} crystal defects on reverse I-V characteristics of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) using electron-beam induced current (EBIC) mode of SEM. Two types of SiC APD structures (I and II) were fabricated using 2 inch p-doped substrates with n-doped epilayers and 3 inch n-doped substrates with p- and n- epilayers. Areas of the formed diodes were approximately 1 mm 2. The devices without any kind of electrically active 3 -D structural defects demonstrated breakdown voltages close to theoretical values, ~ 500 V for the APD <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> and ~ 1200 V for Type II APD. Stability of <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> devices was <b>tested</b> by applying a short pulse of high voltage (~ 800 V). EBIC images, taken prior to and after the failure test, showed new defects in the dislocation free area, which, presumably, were caused by thermal breakdown...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} {{the interaction between}} Portland <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cement and motor oil, and its influence on the hydration of the cement. The Portland <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cement was <b>tested</b> by using a Viscosity meter, a Zeta potential meter and by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The tested samples containing increasing concentration of motor oil were subjected to Viscosity, Zeta potential and Infrared spectroscopy (IR) tests. Ultimate compressive strength (UCS) and Chemical oxygen demand (COD) tests, which signify the leachability of the oil from the cement, are also included. The results show that oil (1) retards hydration, (2) reduces bonding in the cement, and (3) leaches from the hydrated cement. The presence of calcium silicate polymerization, indicated {{by the appearance of}} Si-H, CO 3 - 2, and SiO 4 - 4 after 90 minutes of hydration, shows that cement hydration was inhibited both by oil and by one freeze-thaw cycle.

40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} lethal {{and severe}} osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) {{is caused by}} the deficiency of cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl- 3 -hydroxylase 1 (P 3 H 1) because of CRTAP and LEPRE 1 mutations. We analyzed five families in which 10 individuals had a clinical diagnosis of lethal and severe OI with an overmodification of collagen <b>type</b> <b>I</b> on biochemical <b>testing</b> and without a mutation in the collagen <b>type</b> <b>I</b> genes. CRTAP mutations not described earlier were identified in the affected individuals. Although it seems that one important feature of autosomal recessive OI due to CRTAP mutations is the higher consistency of radiological features with OI type II-B/III, differentiation between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive OI on the basis of clinical, radiological and biochemical investigations proves difficult in the affected individuals reported here. These observations confirm that once a clinical diagnosis of OI has been made in an affected individual, biochemical testing for overmodification of collagen <b>type</b> <b>I</b> should always be combined with molecular genetic analysis of the collagen <b>type</b> <b>I</b> genes. If no mutations in the collagen <b>type</b> <b>I</b> genes are found, additional molecular genetic analysis of the CRTAP and LEPRE 1 genes should follow. This approach will allow proper identification of the genetic cause of lethal or severe OI, which is important in providing prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and estimating recurrence ris...|$|R
40|$|TutorialTutorial 18 : Understanding {{the lateral}} rotordynamic {{behavior}} {{is critical in}} determining the reliability/operability of rotating equipment. Whether examining a centrifugal pump or compressor, steam or gas turbine, motor or generator, rotating machinery share the same need to accurately predict and measure dynamic behavior. Industrial specifications determining fit for purpose rely on the accuracy of rotordynamic predictions where direct measurement is impractical or otherwise impossible in an industrial setting. Testing to confirm rotordynamic prediction and behavior provides both the purchaser and vendor the confidence that the design will meet project expectations. Rotordynamic shop testing has several options available to the project during acceptance tests at the vendor?s shop. These options include mechanical run, string and full load/Type 1 testing as well as verification testing to validate unbalance response and stability predictions. Such testing has numerous advantages; the most important being the avoidance of production disruptions involved with testing at the job site. Each test option has associated costs as well as limitations as to what lateral vibration characteristics are revealed. Understanding these factors is vital to efficiently mitigate {{the risks associated with}} the purchased equipment. Applying best practices and an understanding of the industrial (API) test requirements are needed to derive the maximum benefit of each test option. The best practices not only involve the test procedure but also the associated analytical methods used to post process the measurement information. Whether performing a simple mechanical run test or more complex stability verification during ASME <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>testing,</b> ensuring that a logical, repeatable and proven methodology is followed produces reliable evidence to confirm the rotordynamic model and lateral vibration performance. The rationale behind the API test requirements provides an understanding of why that test is being performed and its correct application to the dynamic behavior. Test options can be separated into two categories; tests that reveal portions of the dynamic behavior of the equipment to specific operating conditions and those used to verify the analytical predictions of that behavior. API mechanical, string and <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> (or full load) tests reveal the rotordynamic behavior of the equipment to a given set of conditions. These are used specifically to determine acceptability of the design. Unbalance and stability verification testing is used to confirm (or provide confidence in) the rotordynamic model. Confidence in the model permits extrapolation of the design (vendor) and operation (purchaser) beyond the machine?s asbuilt and specific shop test conditions...|$|R
