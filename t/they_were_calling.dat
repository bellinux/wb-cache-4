5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>calling</b> an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E

500|$|Motley {{and fellow}} black {{teammate}} Bill Willis contended with racism throughout their careers. Although the color barrier was broken in all major American sports by 1950, the men endured shouted insults {{on the field}} and racial discrimination off of it. [...] "They found out that while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>calling</b> us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E
500|$|In {{their second}} game, the Browns faced the Chicago Rockets at Soldier Field before {{a crowd of}} 51,962 people, an {{attendance}} record for a professional football game in Chicago. It {{was the first of}} many games during which Cleveland's two black players, Marion Motley and Bill Willis, endured racially charged verbal and physical abuse. Some of their white teammates, including Lou Rymkus, retaliated by dealing their own cheap shots. Motley opened the scoring with a 20-yard run for a touchdown, the first in his career. Lou Groza added two field goals in the third quarter, and halfback Don Greenwood ran for a 41-yard touchdown to make the final score 20–6. Chicago's only points came on a touchdown run by Billy Hillenbrand on the first play of the fourth quarter. Motley later said that racism on the field stopped after opponents saw how well he and Willis played: [...] "They found out that while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>calling</b> us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them. So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." ...|$|E

She said, [...] "When I was doing her video with her, she called me and she said, 'What {{do you want to}} do?' [...] And I'm like, 'I don't want to show up in some frickin' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video.' I said, 'I want to do you.' [...] I want to do my version of Beyoncé.

500|$|Erik Nordby of KNB (known for {{his work}} on The Haunting in Connecticut, which also {{features}} co-star Kyle Gallner) stated, [...] "We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together." [...] He said the director and producers wanted an [...] "old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects" [...] so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline. Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and [...] "provided a clear direction" [...] for Nordby and his team. [...] "At that point when we met with them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>calling</b> 'Evil Jennifer,'" [...] he said. [...] "There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face." [...] Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB [...] "produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [...] and [...] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety" [...] and that [...] " [...] responded really well".|$|E
500|$|Along with Blue Lines, Maxinquaye {{was hailed}} by journalists as the pivotal release in what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>calling</b> [...] "trip hop" [...] music; Jon Pareles, the chief critic at The New York Times, {{called it the}} genre's [...] "first album-length masterpiece". Tricky disliked the term, saying [...] "I was {{supposed}} to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it". In a retrospective review for Stylus Magazine, Hebert argued that [...] "there's too much here to be sequestered to any genre, let alone that one... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling Prince 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music is so much better than that." [...] In Mojo, Victoria Segal later called Maxinquaye [...] "an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone". It was dubbed [...] "the British postmodern album of the 90s" [...] by Jason Draper of Record Collector and [...] "a visionary post-rock statement" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirers Tom Moon, while AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it remained [...] "a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen" [...] because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of [...] "noise and experimental music". In The Village Voice, Christgau believed its significance lied in an aesthetic of cool derived from the blues and African-American culture, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{tranquil}} setting {{offered by}} Astoria, the sessions were often {{interrupted by the}} escalating row between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had {{the rights to the}} Pink Floyd name. [...] O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued the bassist for £25,000 of back-commission. [...] In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (since 1973, Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to [...] "the new Pink Floyd project". [...] He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. [...] Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. [...] Gilmour's team responded by issuing a non-confrontational press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, the guitarist later told a Sunday Times reporter: [...] "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant." [...] Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin (the producer later suggested that he was being [...] "checked out"). [...] As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. [...] Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A Studios in Los Angeles: [...] "It was fantastic because...the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>calling</b> {{in the middle of the}} night." [...] The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. [...] The legal disputes were resolved by the end of 1987.|$|E
