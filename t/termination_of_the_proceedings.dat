60|$|All {{of these}} {{questions}} were fired off at the witness from the court in a single breath. In fact, it was {{the knowledge that the}} first ducks of the season had been seen in the Ossawippi marsh that led to the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> before the afternoon was a quarter over. Mullins and George Duff and half the witnesses were off with shotguns as soon as the court was cleared.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{forms of}} Charter defence can lead {{not to the}} {{exclusion}} of evidence but to the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> known as a stay of proceedings. For example, if the accused is not brought to trial within a reasonable time, the proceedings must be stayed for delay by virtue of ss.11(b) and 24(1) of the Charter. Stays of proceedings can also take place {{in the absence of a}} Charter violation. For example, the familiar [...] "defence" [...] of entrapment is neither a true defence nor necessarily a Charter breach. When entrapment is successfully established, the proceedings are deemed to be an [...] "abuse of process" [...] for which the remedy is a stay of proceedings. Cases of abuse of process arise in certain other circumstances, and they can also can involve Charter breaches, and there is significant overlap.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is an even}} broader {{sense of}} the word [...] "defence". Sometimes the defence will raise an issue capable of leading either to the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> or the {{exclusion}} of evidence. For example, in a drug case the accused might argue that the search warrant by which the police entered his house and seized the drugs was defective and that his constitutional rights were therefore violated. If he is successful in establishing such a violation, the evidence can be excluded, and usually the Crown cannot otherwise prove its case. When this sort of thing happens, it is not really a defence at all, since the accused must establish it in a separate pre-trial application. Nevertheless, lawyers often refer to such applications as a [...] "Charter defence" [...] in reference to the Charter of Rights.|$|E

50|$|In January 1640 Stapley, then {{a justice}} of the peace, was {{reported}} to Dr. William Bray, Archbishop Laud's chaplain, as causing trouble to the churches by his puritan leanings. On {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War he received a colonel's commission in the parliamentary army, and was present at the siege of Chichester in December 1642 under Sir William Waller. He was left as governor of the town and garrison when Waller moved on to the siege of Arundel Castle. On 22 September 1643 he took the covenant. At the beginning of 1644 he raised objections to the quartering in the town of some of Waller's horse. The dispute was referred to a committee of the House of Commons, and finally to the committee of both kingdoms on 26 February He was ordered by both bodies to observe Waller's commands. While detained in London he was exonerated from all blame in the event of disaster at Chichester. He resumed the command of the town and garrison at the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> early in March. He retained his governorship till 1645, when he was succeeded by Colonel Algernon Sidney. In January 1644 he was deputy lieutenant of the county of Sussex.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the question of whether}} women and men are sentenced differently for similar delicts. The study sample consisted of 40 males and 40 females, matched on the basis of various key data (see below), partially mentally ill lawbreaker, who were examined at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry of the Charité Berlin. The investigation period covered the years 1988 to 2007. The overall outcome of this work is that in terms of sentencing, no significant differences regarding the acquittal, the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the imposition of a fine (although the amount was not included) or a prison sentence on probation have been detected. However, men were significantly more often sentenced to prison without parole than women. Despite an apparent trend, at high standard deviation, we could find {{no significant difference between the}} study groups in relation to the total period of the ordered imprisonment. Another result of this investigation is a trend in the order of the measure, which was spoken out three times more common among women. Another significant difference was the residence during the assessment by the psychiatric or psychological expert. A third of men and one fifth of women were at that time in prison, in freedom there were one quarter of women and only one tenth of men. To avoid or minimize disturbances, the attention was paid in this work that essential factors such as age, type of the delict, previous criminal record, psychiatric diagnosis, psychosocial situation of the subjects were comparable. The variables such as the exact circumstances of the offense, preparation and behavior after the crime as well as motives of the perpetrator could not be considered in this work. Finally, it should be noted that one possible reason for the found difference is that no exact match could be made in the main diagnoses of the two study groups. More frequent order of imprisonment without parole, and more frequent placement in prison could be explained by it. In one third of women, a mood disorder was diagnosed so that possibly that was the reason why they were placed in the psychiatric hospital in accordance to § 63 StGB. Considering the present results, the research question whether women are treated differently than men in court, cannot be clearly affirmed. The local findings rather speak that men and women with similar crimes and similar criminal history are largely judged equal in the court...|$|E
40|$|This {{selection}} {{covers the}} most important decisions from the period of 1998 to 2001. The criterion for our selection of cases was their suitability to present the jurisprudence concerning the protection of fundamental rights (from the aspects {{of the right to}} defence, freedom of expression, right to self-determination, right of association etc.). Beyond doubt, the decision on the constitutionality of the Act on the promulgation of the Europe Agreement falls out of the scope specified above. We still hold it justified including that decision in the present selection, as {{it is important to note}} how the Constitutional Court interpreted the applicability of the Agreement in Hungary before its accession to the Union [Decision 30 / 1998 (VI. 25.) AB]. The order on the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> related to the decision is also included [Decision 483 /B/ 1996 AB]. The basic doctrinal principles of the jurisprudence concerning the protection of fundamental rights were essentially elaborated in the early 90 s. The decisions published in this volume reflect, on the one hand, acceptance of the stare decisis principle, i. e. the fact that decisions are built upon one another, thus offering access to essential holdings of previous decisions, and, on the other hand, the additions to the interpretations of the Constitution given earlier. This is how - among others - the so-called second decision on abortion [Decision 48 / 1998 (XI. 23.) AB], the basic decision on interpreting the freedom of expression [Decision 30 / 1992 (V. 26.) AB], and, in relation to that, the constitutional review of the penalization of the so-called incitement to hatred [Decision 12 / 1999 (V. 21.) AB] have been included in this volume. There are other decisions, too, relating to the freedom of expression, e. g. the decisions on interpreting the punishment of scare-mongering [Decision 18 / 2000 (VI. 6.) AB] and the "right of reply" [Decision 57 / 2001 (XII. 5.) AB]. As an example of additions of substance, the decision giving the interpretation of the interrelation between social rights and the right to human dignity may be mentioned [Decision 32 / 1998 (VI. 25.) AB], or the exploration of the contents of the right to having a place of residence on the basis of interpreting the right to social security [Decision 42 / 2000 (XI. 8.) AB]. Finally, one should note the decision on extending the framework of the right to self-determination in healthcare and on the medical treatment of psychiatric patients [Decision 36 / 2000 (X. 27.) AB], opening new dimensions for the interpretation of the right to human dignity. The editors hope that the decisions selected for publication represent a good cross-section of the Constitutional Court's jurisprudence of four years.

The thesis differentiates between the following generally applicable grounds for <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract: (i) a material breach of contract; (ii) a breach of contract (whether material or immaterial) constituting delay within <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Civil Code, (iii) fulfilment of specific obligation with defects and (iv) anticipatory breach of contract. Each ground for termination is analysed in detail and <b>the</b> overlaps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific grounds for termination is identified.
