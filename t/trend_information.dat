Orthalicus reses reses status is currently assessed by the numbers of discrete populations that are known. Accordingly, potential <b>trend</b> <b>information</b> only includes observations of whether various populations continue to persist. However, for most populations, even the area occupied is poorly defined. As of 2006, a tabulation of all well-known and poorly documented sites indicated that Orthalicus reses reses occupied approximately 25 sites in the Florida Keys (Monroe County) and two sites on the mainland (Miami-Dade County).|$|E

Other Federal agencies, like land managing and water development agencies, use {{the data on}} participation rates, species sought, and types of resources used to formulate policies, programs, and plans related to recreational fish and wildlife uses. Federal regulatory, permitting, and environmental agencies rely on the economic data for estimating damages to fish and wildlife resources, and for determining the benefits and costs of projects affecting natural resources. Data are used in evaluating alternative plans and their environmental impacts. State fish and wildlife agencies, in conjunction with their fishery and wildlife sections, use the Survey data for program planning, development, management, and evaluation. Other non-federal conservation organizations, researchers, and trade and manufacturing associations rely on the Survey data too. They also participate in identifying priorities for data collection and streamlining.|$|E

Traditionally with a [...] "supermarket" [...] market the buying is divided into multi-functional departments. The buying team uses the bottom-up approach when <b>trend</b> <b>information</b> is involved, meaning the information is only shared with the company's fifteen top suppliers. [...] On the other hand, information about future aims, and strategies of production are shared downward within the buyer hierarchy so the team can consider lower cost production options. [...] The buyers also interact closely with merchandising and design departments of the company because of the buyer's focus on style and color. The buyer must also consult with the overall design team to understand the cohesion between trend forecasting and consumer's wants. The close relationships result in flexibility within the company and an accelerated response speed to the demands of the market.|$|E
50|$|This is one {{in which}} a {{controller}} provides highly accurate navigational guidance inazimuth and elevation to a pilot. Pilots are given headings to fly, to direct them to, and keep their aircraft alignedwith the extended centerline of the landing runway. They are told to anticipate glidepath interceptionapproximately 10-30 seconds before it occurs and when to start descent. The published decision height will be givenonly if the pilot requests it. If the aircraft is observed to deviate above or below the glidepath, the pilot is giventhe relative amount of deviation by use of terms “slightly” or “well” and is expected to adjust the aircraft rateof descent/ascent to return to the glidepath. <b>Trend</b> <b>information</b> is also issued with respect to the elevation ofthe aircraft and may be modified by the terms “rapidly” and “slowly” (e.g., “well above glidepath, comingdown rapidly”). Range from touchdown is given at least once each mile. If an aircraft is observed by thecontroller to proceed outside of specified safety zone limits in azimuth and/or elevation and continue to operateoutside these prescribed limits, the pilot will be directed to execute a missed approach or to fly a specifiedcourse unless the pilot has the runway environment (runway, approach lights, etc.) in sight. Navigationalguidance in azimuth and elevation is provided the pilot until the aircraft reaches the published decision height. Advisorycourse and glidepath information is furnished by the controller until the aircraft passes over the landingthreshold, at which point the pilot is advised of any deviation from the runway centerline. Radar service isautomatically terminated upon completion of the approach.|$|E
