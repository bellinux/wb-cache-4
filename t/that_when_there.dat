25|$|In B. subtilis, this pathway is {{regulated}} by a two-component system: DesK and DesR. DesK is a membrane-associated kinase and DesR is a transcriptional regulator of the des gene. The regulation responds to temperature; {{when there is}} a drop in temperature, this gene is upregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids increase the fluidity of the membrane and stabilize it under lower temperatures. DesK is the sensor protein <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is a decrease in temperature, will autophosphorylate. DesK-P will transfer its phosphoryl group to DesR. Two DesR-P proteins will dimerize and bind to the DNA promoters of the des gene and recruit RNA polymerase to begin transcription.|$|E
25|$|There could thus be {{spectacular}} {{differences in}} pay {{within a particular}} group, with the most valued workers sometimes receiving as much as fives {{times more than the}} least valued. Even Roach's best paid workers, however, were usually paid little better, and sometimes worse, than comparable tradesmen at other yards, and Roach's overall wage rates were on average lower than his competitors. His business though did not suffer more industrial action, which Roach, who had spent many years as a tradesman himself, attributed to his rapport with his employees. A more concrete reason may have been the fact that Roach still operated his old New York shipyard, the Morgan Iron Works, so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was a strike at one plant he could readily defeat it by simply transferring his operations to the other.|$|E
25|$|Parasite ecology is complex, usually {{involving}} hosts {{that have}} multiple parasites (multi-parasite hosts), parasites that have multiple hosts (multi-host parasites), and competition within a host. These interactions affect parasite and host reproduction and therefore evolution, including of the virulence of parasites and of methods of transmission. Reviewing the field, T. Rigaud and colleagues noted in 2010 {{that among the}} outcomes demonstrated empirically are that multiple infection can affect virulence, and can trigger evolutionary change; that the parasites involved in the same host may have contrasting transmission modes; and that assemblages of multiple parasites can be more virulent than would be expected from each individual parasite. Rigaud and colleagues also consider trade-offs of virulence among hosts (that adaptation for higher virulence in one host means lower virulence in others), predicting <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are many hosts, the outcome will be non-specialist parasites with relatively low virulence. Where hosts differ in quality, Rigaud and colleagues predict that parasites should become optimally virulent in their primary host. On the other hand, they also predict that the more diverse the host community, the lower the incidence of parasites should be, because infecting hosts that are unsuitable or resistant means the loss of those parasites (wasted transmission).|$|E

25|$|Charvaka's {{epistemological}} {{argument can}} be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is smoke (middle term), one's tendency may be to leap {{to the conclusion that}} it must be caused by fire (major term in logic). While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.|$|E

He discovered that a supercurrent could tunnel through a thin barrier, predicting, according to physicist Andrew Whitaker, that [...] "at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage; <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; {{and that there is a}} dependence on any magnetic field." [...] This became known as the Josephson effect and the junction as a Josephson junction.|$|E
500|$|Moodu Pani was {{released}} on 6 November 1980. The film was commercially successful, running for over 200 days in theatres. It received critical acclaim, with critics praising the performances of Pothen and Shoba. On 30 November 1980, Ananda Vikatan said that half the dialogues in the film were spoken by the camera, and felt <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was great cinematography, {{there was no need}} for screenplay and dialogues. The 1991 book Indian Cinema by India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that Mahendra and Pothen [...] "had brought superb craftsmanship to their sensitively told stories" [...] such as Moodu Pani. English journalist Phil Hardy stated in his 1997 book The BFI Companion to Crime, [...] "Finally, given the tendency in Indian cinema to remake successful Hollywood films, it is worth signalling Balu Mahendra's remake of Psycho in Tamil, Moodupani (1980)." ...|$|E

On 29 October 1889, nearly {{a year to the}} day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.|$|E
500|$|After its release, it {{had high}} sales rates in Japan, selling {{over one million}} copies a short time after release. Its release in the US did not create as much hype as in Japan mainly because the market for the Dynasty Warriors series is smaller there, but it still sold fairly well and {{together}} with the Japanese sales, Dynasty Warriors 4 entered into the Greatest Hits charts. In its time Dynasty Warriors 4 has managed to become IGN's 5th best co-operative game on the PS2 as well. The game is criticized for being very similar to older games in the series and retaining some of the features such as the fogging and repetitive gameplay. Even with these drawbacks, Koei went on to release two expansions for Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends and Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires. It had also been ported to the Xbox and to the PC as a Hyper edition.
