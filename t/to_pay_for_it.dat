5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} obvious {{landscape}} evidence remaining of the previous mining activities around Clutton, Temple Cloud, High Littleton and Timsbury. However {{there is a very}} large Batch almost in the middle of Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch was bare, like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton.|$|E
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife and two}} daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it a new lease of life, during {{a period in which}} many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> all directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E

5|$|Information on West Cheswalds {{early career}} is lacking, but records {{of some of}} her {{movements}} and cargo are available. On 30 September 1920, West Cheswald took on a load of white sugar at Java {{and headed for the}} United States via the Suez Canal. While she was near Bermuda, West Cheswald was diverted from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia, to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order. Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia, the purchasers refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> believing that the voyage took too long. After litigation and various appeals, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National Bank of Commerce, 276 U.S. 469 (1928). The court found that under the contract signed, the purchasers were obligated for the sugar {{regardless of whether or not}} the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia. West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920. The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920–21 fiscal year, listed West Cheswald among the four -owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company.|$|E
5|$|When the Department of Engineering {{laid out}} the initial state highway system after the state's voters {{approved}} a bond issue <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in 1910, they included Route5, connecting Santa Cruz and Oakland with Stockton via Altamont Pass. San Joaquin County paved the portion near Tracy with asphalt with their own bond issue, passed in 1909, and the state later resurfaced it with concrete. In addition, the new concrete road bypassed Banta, which the old county road had passed through via Banta Road, F Street, and Grant Line Road. Otherwise, the road was relatively direct, coming down from Altamont Pass onto Grant Line Road, following Byron Highway into Tracy, and leaving east and northeasterly on 11th Street to the San Joaquin River at the Mossdale Crossing. The Lincoln Highway Association chose this route in 1913 for their transcontinental highway, where it remained until the Carquinez Bridge opened in 1927, creating a shorter route via Vallejo. In 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials designated the Stockton-Bay Area route as US48, which was absorbed by an extension of US50 by the early 1930s.|$|E
25|$|When {{construction}} began, {{the costs}} for the first phase had risen to $292.7 million; the state had sold $300 million in bonds <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Segments of the highway, from Clarksburg just west of Vanceburg to Tollesboro was routed on an earlier relocated alignment of KY 10.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} for forwards, however, where no daily true-up {{takes place in}} turn creates credit risk for forwards, {{but not so much}} for futures.

25|$|In 1923, {{the school}} {{purchased}} what is today the Belknap Campus, where it moved its liberal arts programs and law school, {{with the medical}} school remaining downtown. The school had attempted to purchase a campus donated by the Belknap family in The Highlands area in 1917 (where Bellarmine University is currently located), but a citywide tax increase <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was voted down. The Belknap Campus was named after the family for their efforts.|$|E

25|$|The army of {{the early}} empire was sharply and qualitatively different. Augustus defined a {{permanent}} professional army by setting the enlistment at 16 years (with an additional 4 for reserve obligations), and establishing a special military fund, the aerarium militare, imposing a 5% inheritance tax and 1% auction sales tax <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> From it came bonus payments to retiring soldiers amounting to several years' salary. It could also {{have been used to}} guarantee regular pay. Previously legions had to rely on booty.|$|E

25|$|In May 2007, Fincham {{took the}} {{decision}} to drop Neighbours, an Australian soap opera, from BBC One after 21 years on the channel, when its producers significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in a bidding war. Fincham commented that it was 'a big loss', but that BBC One would not pay 'the best part of £300million'. Neighbours left the channel in spring 2008 to move to Channel 5. The Weakest Link was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap, with the afternoon CBBC slot moving 20minutes earlier.|$|E
25|$|Corruption, in {{this context}} the {{diversion}} of public finance from {{the needs of the}} army, may have contributed greatly to the Fall. The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> or to offer their own workers as army recruits. They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church. At a local level, from the early fourth century, the town councils lost their property and their power, which often became concentrated {{in the hands of a}} few local despots beyond the reach of the law.|$|E
25|$|Today, only 51% of the Deerwood {{residents}} {{are members of}} the Country Club.

However, there are about 100 non-residents who are Deerwood Country Club members. When the Deerwood Board of Governors made the decision to build a new clubhouse and renovate the golf course at a cost estimated at $9.5 million, all Equity members were assessed a fee <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Membership dropped from 700 in 2000 to approximately 500 in January 2004, when the project began.
