This deck is most commonly found in France, Wallonia, Romandy, Québec, and Denmark.|$|R

The <b>Tarot</b> Nouveau, of Frankfurt origin, has trumps which depict scenes of traditional social activities; this differs from the Renaissance allegorical motifs found in Italian-suited <b>Tarot</b> decks such as the <b>Tarot</b> de Marseille, Tarocco Piemontese, the Tarocco Bolognese, or even the Rider-Waite well known in cartomancy.

50|$|<b>Tarot</b> {{games from}} Piedmont, the Italian region {{bordering}} France, are {{more similar to}} French <b>tarot</b> than other Italian games {{as it was the}} French that (re-)introduced <b>tarot</b> to that region.

The most common Piedmontese <b>tarot</b> games are Scarto, Mitigati, Chiamare il Re, and Partita which can be found in Pinerolo and Turin. Piedmontese games are also the simplest <b>tarot</b> games and can be used to introduce new players on basic rules and features. Troccas, a Swiss <b>tarot</b> game, is also related and is played with the 78-card Swiss 1JJ <b>Tarot,</b> another derivative of the <b>Tarot</b> de Marseille. Danish Grosstarok, which focuses on winning the final trick, also uses the <b>Tarot</b> Nouveau.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the purpose}} of the rules, the {{numbering}} of the trumps are the only thing that matters. The symbolic tarot images customary in non-gaming divinatory <b>tarots</b> have no effect in the game itself. The design traditions of these decks subsequently evolved independently and they often bear only numbers and whimsical scenes arbitrarily chosen by the engraver. However, there are still traditional sequences of images in which the common lineage is visible; e.g. the moon that is commonly visible at the bottom left corner of the trump card 21 stems from confusion of the German word Mond, meaning Moon, with Italian mondo and French monde, meaning [...] "world", the usual symbol associated with the trump card 21 on Italian suited <b>tarots</b> and in non-gaming divinatory tarot.|$|E

50|$|He {{has devoted}} 20 {{years to the}} study of the <b>Tarots</b> of the French (Marseille) Tradition. In 1996 he {{undertook}} an oversized restoration of the tarot of Nicolas Conver (Marseille, 1760). His aim was to faithfully bring this traditional imagery back to life in all its original freshness. He then revived large-sized versions of other historic <b>tarots</b> from originals preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris: Jean Noblet (Paris, c. 1650), Jean Dodal (Lyon, 1701) and a number of trumps from Jacques Viéville (Paris, c. 1650). It was in painting each arcane on giant canvases (220 cm by 110 cm) that he was able to come to 'understand' the way the images are operative in themselves. He regularly transports them for exhibitions, and proposes conference-workshops in a variety of tarot-related contexts.|$|E

50|$|Animal <b>tarots</b> (German: Tiertarock) are a subgenre of tarot decks. The {{earliest}} {{examples are}} from 18th-century Germany, probably designed by A.B. Göbl of Munich. A theme of animals, real and/or fantastic, replaces the traditional trump {{scenes of the}} Tarot of Besançon, a derivative of the Tarot of Marseilles. They are the first known types of French-suited tarot patterns. Patterns with full-figured courts, prominent during the 18th - 20th centuries, included the Bavarian and the Belgium styles. Later designs are the Upper Austria Animal Tarot and Adler Cego cards. Animal <b>tarots</b> were most commonly found in northern Europe, from Belgium to Russia, until the decline of tarot card games during the mid-19th century. In Austria-Hungary, they were replaced by the Industrie und Glück decks. The Adler Cego used in Baden is the only animal tarot pattern still in common use.|$|E
