5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>the</b> International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as {{the definition of the}} fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the atomic spectrum of krypton, but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attraction}} of the Andriyivskyy Descent is the baroque Saint Andrew's Church. It is located atop a hill overlooking the Podil neighborhood from the Andriyivskyy Descent. The idea <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>the</b> Saint Andrew's Church came from the Russian Tsaress Elizabeth Petrovna. When she visited Kiev in 1747–1754, she laid the foundation brick of the church with her own hand, after which the church was constructed, to a design by the imperial architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790.

The earliest recessions for which there is the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.|$|E

5|$|For {{nearly a}} decade, no new {{construction}} took place.

40|$|AbstractIn manufacturing, Product-Service Systems (PSS) {{that create}} value by {{coupling}} a physical product and a service have been attracting attention. According to this background, many researchers have proposed PSS development methods that provide guidance on HOW TO realize a PSS. However, difficulties still remain with regard <b>to</b> <b>constructing</b> an organization for PSS development; i. e., answering the question, WHO realizes a PSS? In order to clarify problems with regard <b>to</b> <b>constructing</b> <b>the</b> organization, this paper proposes an organizational framework for PSS development. Based on this framework, this paper points outsome research challenges with regard <b>to</b> <b>constructing</b> <b>the</b> organization for PSS development, and then, introducing the PSS development methods that can address these challenges...|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969.

Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during {{the decades of}} plant operations.|$|E
