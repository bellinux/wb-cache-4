Negative effects stemming from such uncertainties can be mitigated by following best practices for <b>turnaround</b> planning and <b>management.</b> There has been no comprehensive review of best practices for <b>turnaround</b> planning and <b>management</b> in past research. Our review presents guidelines and recommendations based on existing best practices to support managers and engineers involved in turnarounds. Because {{they are based on}} proven best practices, implementation of the recommendations should improve power plant <b>turnaround</b> planning and <b>management</b> processes, leading to better project performance. Our paper compares planning and management practices followed in a real turnaround project case to the best practices in order to find gaps and commonalities; the systematic methodology we propose can be implemented by other companies involved in turnaround projects in order to improve their planning and management processes...|$|R

Further, we find no evidence of a direct link between client operating or strategic initiatives and an auditor's going-concern judgment...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSCorporate <b>turnaround</b> and {{recovery}} <b>management</b> in South Africa has received much attention {{from both the}} Government {{and the private sector}} in recent years. The failure of a significant number of firms has resulted in the current trend to save companies, rather than to liquidate them. The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain the factors that made a South African business turnaround successful with specific reference to the impact of organisation size on those efforts. A combined quantitative and qualitative study revealed that the chief causes of decline, the strategies required and key success factors across SMEs and large firms were different. Additionally it showed that the impact of some of these factors on the firm depended on the size of the company. Of these there were six decline factors (Management/Owner of the business, Inertia and Intransigence, the External Environment, Lack of Resources and Funding, Insufficient Strategic Planning, Emotional Attachment to the Business), three strategies (Replacement of Management, Revenue Generating/Growth, Improved Sales and Marketing) and one success factor (Calibre and Motivation of people). Five indigenous, South African factors were highlighted as key. These were the labour laws, the lack of turnaround legislation, the lack of turnaround financing, the lack of skills and Black Economic Empowerment (BEE).

40|$|Purpose of {{the article}} : Over the past couplne of months, the global economy went trhough a cascade of financial shocks that threw many economies. The {{economic}} damage has been extensive, with few countries spared – even those far from {{the source of the}} turmoil. As prospects for both global growth and inflation moderated over the period, bond yields declined in major developed countries. Prices of many commodities reached a plateau or even fell, lowering the near-term inflation outlook. Investors continued to expect strong growth in emerging economies, but cut back their growth expectations for the United States d Europe. The growth outlook for other major advanced economies remained subdued. The purpose of this artice is to analyse the global economy development in both emerging and advanced economies, as well as financial market trends and their predictions in the light of international financial imbalances. Addressing overindebtedness, private as well as public, is the key to building a solid foundation for high, balanced real growth and a stable financial system. Methodology/methods : The methods of analyses and synthesis have been used to enable to judge the complexity of objects from more angles and to formulize the conclusions of the analytical part. Empirical methods had enabled us to gain an overview about <b>turnaround</b> financial <b>management</b> applied during volatile times in the selected economies and financial and non-financial institutions. Scientific aim: The main scientific aim is to conduct the analyses of the theoretical assumptions leading up to changing trends {{in the development of the}} global economy, as well as analyses of factors, economical indicators, financial risks and their predictions, in connection with the financial markets and selected economies development based on own elaborated knowledge’s from research field. Findings : In many economies, high debt levels still burden households as well as financial and non-financial institutions, and the consolidation of fiscal accounts has barely started. International financial imbalances are re-emerging. Highly accommodative monetary policies are fast becoming a threat to price stability. Financial reforms have yet to be completed and fully implemented. And the data frameworks that should serve as an early warning system for financial stress remain underdeveloped. Conclusions: Interrelated imbalances made pre-crisis growth in several advanced countries unsustainable.  Rapidly increasing debt and asset prices resulted in bloated housing and financial sectors. The boom also masked serious longterm fiscal vulnerabilities that, if left unchecked, could trigger the next crisis. The lessons of the crisis apply to emerging market economies, too.

40|$|India became {{independent}} in 1947. Its central planning model emphasized {{the development of}} core sectors of Indian economy through Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). PSUs played {{an active role in}} economic development for more than four decades. The process of liberalization and globalization began in 1991. The Central and State Governments initiated process of disinvestment and decontrol in various PSUs. Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (GSFC) was one of such PSUs. It was promoted in 1962 by the State Government of Gujarat (GoG) with its 49 % equity share, as a joint sector fertilizer company. The objective of the Government was to promote agricultural growth by providing chemical fertilizers and other inputs along with extension services to the farmers. Over the years, it diversified into industrial products. It was also instrumental in promotion of other PSUs in Gujarat through equity participation. It had a strong brand image among the farmers. In 2004, GoG appointed an Expert Committee (EC) to review the performance and sustainability of various PSUs in the State of Gujarat including GSFC and to recommend whether or not the Government should continue to hold its investment in them. The task of EC in providing recommendations on GSFC was very challenging because GSFC incurred losses for the first time during 2000 – 1 to 2002 – 3 since its inception but showed dramatic turnaround in 2003 – 4 and further improved its financial performance in 2004 – 5 and 2005 – 6. EC had to reassess the developmental role of GSFC and the need for GoG to continue its involvement. It had to assess the sustainability of improved financial performance in future and decide whether or not GoG should disinvest its stake.

40|$|Laboratory {{quality is}} {{continuously}} present {{in our daily}} practice of molecular diagnosis in human genetics. Our participation in external quality assessment (EQA), specially with EMQN, gave {{us the opportunity to}} improve the reports of our genetic tests, to compare our performance/scores with other European laboratories, and to be permanently updated with the most recent recommendations for best practice in human molecular diagnosis. Since 2005, our lab has been participating in the EMQN external quality assessment program for the molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis HFE-associated (HH-HFE). Since then, our score regarding the genotyping category has achieved every year the highest marks (2. 0), while for the interpretation category, in two years, the mean score was 1. 75. These scores lead us to improve the “interpretation section” of our reports in order to give the best result to the physicians and patients. In addition of a correct genotyping, the report “interpretation section” is particularly important, it should include the main suggestions for the best patient’s clinical management: i) immediate impact of the result for the patient, ii) patient’s clinical follow-up and other diagnostic options, iii) long term-impact (specially in predictive tests), iv) relevance of the result for relatives and, v) recommendations of genetic counselling. In accordance with OCDE disease specific guidelines for quality assurance in molecular genetic testing, and with the requirements of ISO 15189, in 2014 we were the first Portuguese laboratory accredited by IPAC, for HH-HFE - variants p. H 63 D and p. C 282 Y, and other genetic tests ([URL] ficha_ 15189. asp?id=E 0015). Accreditation under the International Standard ISO 15189 is challenging but contributes to introduce improvements in our current practice because it comprises “management requirements” (e. g. quality management system, external services and supplies, preventive and corrective actions, control of records) and “technical requirements” (e. g. accommodation and environmental conditions, laboratory equipment, reagents and consumables, training and qualifications of personnel, examination processes, results reporting). Accreditation enhances laboratory quality at different levels, gives credibility, competency and confidence, but primarily contributes to a better patient’s clinical diagnosis reducing the <b>turnaround</b> time, patient <b>management</b> and treatment, and genetic counselling.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addressed a}} need for {{better understanding of the}} relationship between crisis, leadership, and organizational change in American higher education. The first objective was to discover the meaning of a governance crisis and whether it was a factor in setting the organization's long-term direction; and secondly, to gain insight into the relationship between leadership created to resolve a crisis and leadership established to lead change. Results from an extensive survey of the literature on crisis and change were presented, as well as a typology showing the role of a crisis in ten types of organizational change. The case concerned an urban community college confronted by a crisis of major proportions. The situation involved the firing of the CEO, the forced resignations of the governing board, threats to withhold state funding, and the imposition of probationary accreditation status by the college's regulatory agency. The study centered on an analysis of key institutional documents, interviews with board members, CEOs, and faculty and staff, as well as the personal observations and insights of the investigator. The time frame for the study spanned over thirty years, beginning in 1966 with the founding of the institution and ending in 1998 almost a decade beyond the actual crisis. A time series analysis was performed that compared dominant trends in the college's history against the patterns of evolution predicted by the life cycle theories of Greiner (1972) and Schein (1997). On a macro level, the first set of findings related to the meaning of the governance crisis for the organization. One finding was that the college had evolved through one complete life cycle and had embarked on a new cycle of development. A second finding was that the governance crisis was a turning point for growth or decline, but more importantly, it served as the catalyst that launched the organization's second life cycle. A third finding was that the governance crisis was a factor of major significance in the organization's long-term development. On a micro level, the second set of findings concerned the leadership transition from crisis to change. One finding was that the governance crisis was not a "normal" crisis associated with lack of fit between the needs of the organization and CEO leadership style. A second finding was that the crisis served as the stimulant that provoked the formation of new leadership for the institution, consisting of the new board and CEO. A third finding was that the role of the new leadership was not limited to resolving the crisis. Rather it made a leadership transition from crisis <b>management,</b> to a <b>turnaround,</b> to change <b>management,</b> which represented significant organizational change in college governance. Five conclusions were offered. First, the crisis was not associated with a mismatch between the needs of the organization and CEO leadership style. Second, the crisis had meaning as a turning point for the organization, specifically as the corrective mechanism for reengaging the community, for halting faculty involvement in the governance process, and for correcting conditions such as the misuse of power throughout the organization, and neutralization of the administration. Third, the crisis had meaning as a catalyst that prompted pervasive change in the institution's approach to governance by rearranging the power relationships among the board, the CEO, and the faculty. Fourth, the crisis had meaning as a stimulant and was a significant factor in the organization's long-term direction. Fifth, this case study confirmed a proposition that leadership dynamics are a function of not only of decision making but also the sources that empower the decision makers. Further research was recommended in three areas. One area for future research was investigation into the organizational behaviour of subgroups at a level below such concepts as "climate, values, or community college philosophy". A second area for future research was periodic analysis of the organizational life cycle for comparison against this case study. The third area recommended for future research was analysis of faculty staffing and loading patterns which could yield important insights into the distinct nature of community college culture. The final recommendation was to establish standards for individuals seeking a position on the governing board and for the undertaking of efforts designed to inform the county electorate as to the relative contribution that each candidate might bring to the board as part of a civic duty...|$|R
