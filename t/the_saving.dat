Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|Ahalya's {{seduction}} by Indra and its repercussions {{form the}} central narrative {{of her story}} in all scriptural sources for her life. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana– whose hero is Rama– {{is the first to}} explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of <b>the</b> <b>saving</b> grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Air Ministry's attitude to his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. <b>The</b> <b>saving</b> grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E

5|$|Buddhism {{arrived in}} Japan in the mid–6th century Asuka period, and was officially {{adopted in the}} wake of the Battle of Shigisan in 587, after which Buddhist temples began to be constructed. The new {{religion}} and customs fundamentally transformed Japanese society and the arts. Funerary traditions such as cremation and the practice of placing epitaphs in graves were imported from China and Korea. Following the treatment of Buddhist relics, the cremated remains in a glass container were wrapped in a cloth and placed in an outer container. Epitaphs, which recorded the lives of the deceased on silver or bronze rectangular strips, were particularly popular from the latter half of the 7th to the end of the 8th century (late Asuka and Nara period). Four epitaphs and a number of cinerary urns and reliquaries containing bones have been designated as National Treasures. Other archaeological National Treasures from the Buddhist era include ritual items buried in the temple foundations of the Golden Halls of Tōdai-ji and Kōfuku-ji in Nara. According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, the world would enter a dark period in 1051; consequently in the late Heian period the belief in <b>the</b> <b>saving</b> powers of Maitreya or Miroku, the Buddha to be, became widespread. Believers buried scriptures and images to gain merit and to prepare for the coming Buddha. This practice, which continued into the Kamakura period, required the transcription of sutras according to strict ritual protocols, their placement in protective reliquary containers and burial in the earth of sacred mountains, shrines or temples to await the future Buddha. The oldest known sutra mound is that of Fujiwara no Michinaga from 1007 on Mount Kinpu, who buried one lotus sutra and five other sutras that he had written in 998. Its sutra container has been designated as National Treasure.|$|E

40|$|According to the National Accounts <b>the</b> German <b>savings</b> {{rate has}} {{increased}} continuously since 2001 after it fell continuously from 1991. This increase was rather unexpected and hence {{it is interesting}} to analyse whether <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> rate of <b>the</b> total population has increased or whether the increase in <b>the</b> aggregated <b>savings</b> rate has been {{due to the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> behaviour of certain socio-economic groups developed differently during the last decade. For this project data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) is used for the years 1995 to 2007. The analysis of household's savings rates differentiated according to socio-economic charac-teristics shows, that <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> rates develop differently depending on the respective house-holder's labour market status. <b>The</b> examination of <b>savings</b> rates of different age groups does not provide conclusive results.
