5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not attack, that {{there were too many}} {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

The next day Kim {{said he was going to}} move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face.

25|$|Alan reveals to Dysart {{that during}} his youth, he had {{established}} his attraction to horses {{by way of}} his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, Western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding.

During this time, Alan also begins to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider scoffed at the father and rode off.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{all these}} advantages, Casaubon {{considered}} many schemes for leaving Paris and settling elsewhere. Offers {{came to him}} from various quarters, including Nîmes, Heidelberg and Sedan, France. His friends Lect and Giovanni Diodati wished, rather than hoped, {{to get him back}} to Geneva. In Paris, Casaubon was still uneasy about his religion: the life of a Parisian Huguenot was always insecure, for the police were likely not strong enough to protect them against a sudden mob uprising. Since the Fontainebleau Conference, an impression prevailed that Casaubon was wavering. The Catholics <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> gain a professorship only if he renounced Protestantism. When it became clear that Casaubon could not be bought, Henry IV, who liked Casaubon personally, took it upon himself to try to convert him. (Henry himself had converted to Catholicism in order to rule France.) The king's cardinal Duperron, in his capacity of aumonier, argued with Casaubon in the king's library. On the other hand, the Huguenot theologians, especially Pierre du Moulin, chief pastor of the church of Paris, accused Casaubon of conceding too much, and of having departed already from the lines of strict Calvinistic orthodoxy.|$|E
500|$|The Browns {{were the}} second {{team in the}} AL to add black players to their roster after the Indians signed Larry Doby in July 1947. Willard Brown and Hank Thompson were {{teammates}} of Heath's during the 1947 season, but Heath was described as committing a [...] "petulant display of prejudice" [...] towards Brown after Brown {{hit a home run}} with one of Heath's old bats. Brown preferred to use a heavy bat and did not bring his own after being told by the Browns the team would supply him with bats. Brown found one of Heath's damaged bats and applied tape to the affix the knob {{to the end of the}} bat. When he tried to use the bat during a game, the umpire <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not use the bat with tape applied, so Brown discarded the loose fragments of the bat and proceeded to hit a home run during the at-bat. When he returned to the dugout, however, Heath destroyed the bat when he hit it against the dugout wall.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956), an {{advertisement}} for Nadodi Mannan was released describing it as an adaptation of The Prisoner of Zenda. A couple of days later, Bharani Pictures, the production company co-founded by P. S. Ramakrishna Rao and Bhanumathi Ramakrishna, released an advertisement for a film whose concept was similar to The Prisoner of Zenda. When Ramachandran and Bhanumathi heard their films were similar, they tried to convince each other to change their film's storyline. After much deliberation, Ramachandran told Bhanumathi that he was keeping [...] "only the section of a commoner switched to king" [...] in the original, {{while the rest of}} the film would be different. Ramachandran accepted that they were both confused over what to do next. A few days later, for unknown reasons, Bharani Pictures' planned film was shelved. Bhanumathi informed Ramachandran and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go ahead with his film. She offered Ramachandran her shelved film's script, written by A. K. Velan, and asked him to use it for Nadodi Mannan. Ramachandran thanked her for her generosity, and offered her the role of Madhana; Bhanumathi agreed to work in the film.|$|E

500|$|In the {{introduction}} to the story as it appears in the DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore trade paperback, Brian Bolland disputes the widely held belief that the story started as a Batman annual story and ended up as a prestige-format book. Bolland recalls that the idea for a one-off Batman story focusing on the Joker—with Batman more of an incidental character—was his. Bolland says that in 1984, DC editor Dick Giordano <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do any project for DC he wanted, and Bolland requested to do a Batman/Joker prestige book with Moore as writer. Bolland has also expressed dissatisfaction with the final book, and regrets that its impending schedule for release meant he could not color the book himself (John Higgins was the colorist). Bolland says that [...] "the end result wasn't quite what I'd hoped. I don't think it rates with some of the highlights of Alan's career." [...] March 2008 saw the release of the artwork as Bolland intended it: the twentieth anniversary hardcover edition of The Killing Joke is completely recolored by Bolland himself. The book made The New York Times Best Seller list in May 2009.|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, the Canucks {{made another}} {{significant}} move, signing Rangers' captain Mark Messier during free agency on July 26, 1997. Despite finally having a high-profile centre to play with, media reports soon appeared claiming that Bure was {{asking to be}} traded. The Canucks opened the season with two games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo – an event organized by the league to market hockey for the upcoming 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. After two injury-plagued seasons with the number 96 on his jersey, Bure switched back to his familiar number 10, explaining: [...] "I'm not superstitious, but {{the last two seasons}} have been bad memories." [...] Although the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second straight year, he returned to his previous form in 1997–98, scoring 51 goals for his first 50-goal season since 1993–94, and third overall. Bure later recalled that with the Canucks out of playoff contention with a handful of games left, head coach Mike Keenan <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play as much as he wanted to reach the milestone. Scoring 50 goals was also implicit in a contract bonus for Bure. With an additional 39 assists, his 90 points ranked him third in the NHL, behind Peter Forsberg and Jaromír Jágr.|$|E
500|$|According to Van Peebles, {{during the}} first day of shooting, {{director}} of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the rushes, Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a period of 19 days {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as [...] "globs," [...] where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a stunt man, he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, [...] "Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again." [...] Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted gonorrhea when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the Directors Guild in order to get workers' compensation because he was [...] "hurt on the job." [...] Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.|$|E

500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI {{talked to him about}} White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Mission of Burma reunited {{and began}} playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and {{formerly}} Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that [...] "when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted {{for maintaining the}} original integrity, and uses a tape deck." [...] Weston began using a digital looping box from Electro-Harmonix in 2007 during live performances, but still uses actual tape loops in the studio. [...] Weston regularly joins the band onstage during encores, playing bass while Conley plays second guitar.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{spectacular}} casts I've ever been lucky enough to be a part of," [...] Tobolowsky wrote. When he was shooting the scene where he and McDonnell eat at a Chinese restaurant, Robinson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do anything he wanted to make her laugh. [...] "Dangerous words. It set the tone for the rest of the shoot," [...] he recalls. [...] "I played with my food. I made up lines (including one about pounding chicken breasts in the kitchen during our second date)." [...] The rest of the cast and crew felt similarly. Near the end of the shoot Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had to do it all over again.|$|E
50|$|Rogers {{was highly}} {{recruited}} {{out of high}} school, and decided to attend the University of South Carolina when coach Jim Carlen <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play in his freshman year.

However, the Gamecocks had two running backs who graduated at the same time, so he began his college career as the starting tailback midway through his freshman season.|$|R
