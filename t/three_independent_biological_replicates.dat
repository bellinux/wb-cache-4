40|$|Abstract Background New {{interventions}} {{are required to}} optimally and sustainably control the Anopheles sp. mosquitoes that transmit malaria and filariasis. The mosquito olfactory system is important in host seeking (transmission) and mate finding (reproduction). Understanding olfactory function could lead to development of control strategies based on repelling parasite-carrying mosquitoes or attracting them into a fatal trap. Findings Our initial focus is on odorant binding proteins with differential transcript accumulation between female and male mosquitoes. We report that the odorant binding protein, OBP 2 (AGAP 003306), had increased expression in the antennae of female vs. male Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (G 3 strain). The increased expression in antennae of females of this gene by quantitative RT-PCR was 4. 2 to 32. 3 fold in <b>three</b> <b>independent</b> <b>biological</b> <b>replicates</b> and two technical replicate experiments using A. gambiae from two different laboratories.

Each array contains probe sets for 51, 279 rice transcripts; out of which, around 48, 564 are from japonica and 1, 260 from indica cultivars. The adaxial surfaces of leaves of 15  days old Taichung Native- 1 (TN- 1) rice seedlings were infiltrated using a needleless syringe with either X. oryzae pv. oryzae ClsA (500  µg/ml) or buffer. Approximately, 10  μl of the solution is infiltrated into each leaf. The zone of infiltration is approximately 1  cm 2. This means that 5  µg of ClsA is infiltrated into an area of approximately 1  cm 2. Total RNA was isolated, 12  h after treatment, from leaf tissues encompassing the zone of infiltration. The samples from 20 – 30 infiltrated leaves were pooled together to obtain enough RNA for the analysis. Following {{a series of steps}} (as described in the “Methods”), the RNA was converted into biotin-labeled cRNA and hybridized to the rice gene chip. Separate gene chips were hybridized for the ClsA and buffer-treated samples, and the experiments were repeated with <b>three</b> <b>independent</b> <b>biological</b> <b>replicates.</b> All the raw data files (CEL files; three for ClsA and three for buffer treatment) obtained from GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS; Affymetrix) were subjected to AVADIS™ Software (Strand Life Science, Bangalore, India) for further analysis. The Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error (PLIER; Affymetrix Inc 2005) and Robust Multichip Average (RMA; Irizarry et al. 2003 a, b) algorithms used in the analysis picked different numbers of genes at p[*]<[*] 0.05. PLIER identified 1, 582 genes as differentially expressed with ≥ 1.5 -fold change and 427 genes with ≥ 2.0 -fold change at p[*]<[*] 0.05 whereas RMA picked 1, 004 and 302 genes with 1.5 - and 2.0 -fold change, respectively, at p[*]<[*] 0.05. In order to reduce the possibility of false discovery, we adopted a stringent criterion wherein we considered only those genes as differentially expressed, which were selected by both the algorithms. A total of 862 genes were common to both lists at 1.5 -fold change and p[*]<[*] 0.05. Q values were calculated from p values of all 862 genes, and q-value-based significance analysis suggested that the expected false positives are only four genes out of this list. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of ≥ 1.5 -fold change rice genes differentially expressed upon ClsA treatment have revealed that genes with GO terms associated with response to stress are overrepresented among upregulated genes while those associated with primary and secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, chloroplast, and plastids are overrepresented among downregulated genes. Genes with GO terms associated with calcium and magnesium ion binding are also overrepresented in upregulated genes while the genes involved in iron ion binding, transporter activity, lipid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis are overrepresented among downregulated genes.|$|E
40|$|The postsynaptic density (PSD) {{signaling}} machinery contains proteins {{with diverse}} functions. Brain region-specific variations in PSD components mediate distinct physiological responses to synaptic activation. We have developed mass spectrometry-based methods to comprehensively compare both relative protein expression and phosphorylation status from proteins present in biochemical preparations of postsynaptic density. Using these methods, we determined the relative expression of 2159 proteins and 1564 phosphorylation sites in PSD preparations from murine cortex, midbrain, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These experiments were conducted twice using <b>independent</b> <b>biological</b> <b>replicates,</b> which {{allowed us to}} assess the experimental and biological variability in this system. Concerning protein expression, cluster analysis revealed that known functionally associated proteins display coordinated synaptic expression. Therefore, proteins identified as co-clustering with known protein complexes are prime candidates for assignment as previously unrecognized components. Concerning degree of phosphorylation, we observed more extensive phosphorylation sites on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors than �-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, consistent with {{the central role of}} N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in processing synaptic transmission patterns. Average kinase and phosphatase levels were highest in the hippocampus, correlating with a higher overall phosphopeptide abundance present in this brain region. These findings suggest that the hippocampus utilizes reversible protein phosphorylation {{to a greater extent than}} other brain regions when modifying synaptic strength.

40|$|The {{superfamily}} of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) {{is involved}} {{in an array of}} fundamental biological processes such as blood coagulation, cell differentiation, cell migration, complement activation, embryo implantation, fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, and inflammation, and tumor suppression. Vertebrate serpins can be conveniently classified into six sub-groups, based on <b>three</b> <b>independent</b> <b>biological</b> features - genomic organization, diagnostic amino acid sites and rare indels. The present vertebrate serpins are derived from an original serpin most probably by intron insertion and we are trying to reconstruct the phylogeny of vertebrate serpin and looking for the reconstruction of original vertebrate gene(s). We started with fish genomes and characterized fish serpins and assigned orthology with respect to human serpins. Most fish serpins are characterised as stereotype vertebrate serpins with some interesting exceptions which suggest that either there are some fish-specific serpins or some fish serpins do not have human orthologs. |$|R
40|$|Orofacial malformations {{resulting}} from genetic and/or environmental causes are frequent human birth defects yet their etiology is often unclear because of insufficient {{information concerning the}} molecular, cellular and morphogenetic processes responsible for normal facial development. We have, therefore, derived a comprehensive expression dataset for mouse orofacial development, interrogating three distinct regions – the mandibular, maxillary and frontonasal prominences. To capture the dynamic changes in the transcriptome during face formation, we sampled five time points between E 10. 5 –E 12. 5, spanning the developmental period from establishment of the prominences to their fusion to form the mature facial platform. Seven <b>independent</b> <b>biological</b> <b>replicates</b> were used for each sample ensuring robustness {{and quality of the}} dataset. Here, we provide a general overview of the dataset, characterizing aspects of gene expression changes at both the spatial and temporal level. Considerable coordinate regulation occurs across the three prominences during this period of facial growth and morphogenesis, with a switch from expression of genes involved in cell proliferation to those associated with differentiation. An accompanying shift in the expression of polycomb and trithorax genes presumably maintains appropriate patterns of gene expression in precursor or differentiated cells, respectively. Superimposed on the many coordinated changes are prominence-specific differences in the expression of genes encoding transcription factors, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules. Thus, the elaboration of each prominenc...|$|R
