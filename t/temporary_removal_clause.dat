50|$|The Sprinter fleet had {{a number}} of {{teething}} problems, including failures to trigger level crossings, which led to their <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> from service on 9 January 1996 on all lines except the Bendigo line.

40|$|The {{removal of}} a patient from a laminar air flow room during {{protected}} isolation poses the risk of his microbial contamination and infection. Nonetheless, <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> from the laminar air flow room may be necessary for certain medical procedures or for psychological relief during prolonged periods of isolation or both. A means for protecting patients during <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> from the laminar air flow room is highly desirable. A previously described total body garment {{has been shown to}} be microbiologically safe and effective, but is expensive, cumbersome, and not very adaptable to patients of different ages and body sizes. We now present an alternative, microbiologically safe transportation system which delivers, high-efficiency particulate air-filtered air over the head and neck through a modified, lightweight, commercially available helmet and power supply and which can be comfortably and reliably used by isolated patients...|$|R

In response, governments have applied supply and demand reduction programs, including the "Meeting Challenges, Making Choices" program, which has lowered the rate of serious injury.

No reason is given towards the removal (even though the site claims that the track {{had been removed from}} their catalog), giving the notion that its only a <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> and not a license issue.

Acquired forms of hypertrichosis {{have a variety of}} sources, and are usually treated by removing the factor causing hypertrichosis, e.g. a medication with undesired side-effects. All hypertrichosis, congenital or acquired, can be reduced through hair removal. Hair removal treatments are categorized into two principal subdivisions: <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> and permanent removal. Treatment may have adverse effects by causing scarring, dermatitis, or hypersensitivity.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the application of}} iridium complexes to catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions. Transfer hydrogenation reactions provide an alternative to direct hydrogenation for the reduction {{of a range of}} substrates. A hydrogen donor, typically an alcohol or formic acid, can be used as the source of hydrogen for the reduction of carbonyl compounds, imines, and alkenes. Heteroaromatic compounds and even carbon dioxide have also been reduced by transfer hydrogenation reactions. In the reverse process, the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds can be achieved by iridium-catalyzed hydrogen transfer reactions, where a ketone or alkene is used as a suitable hydrogen acceptor. The reversible nature of many hydrogen transfer processes has been exploited for the racemization of alcohols, where <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> of hydrogen generates an achiral ketone intermediate. In addition, there is a growing body of work where <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> of hydrogen provides an opportunity for using alcohols as alkylating agents. In this chemistry, an iridium catalyst "borrows" hydrogen from an alcohol to give an aldehyde or ketone intermediate, which can be transformed into either an imine or alkene under the reaction conditions. Return of the hydrogen from the catalyst provides methodology for the formation of amines or C-C bonds where the only by-product is typically water...|$|R

They were the {{descendants}} of about three hundred MacGregors whom the Earl of Murray, about the year 1624, transported from his estates in Menteith to oppose against his enemies the MacIntoshes, a race as hardy and restless as they were themselves.|$|R

40|$|The {{second in}} a series of {{articles}} on the Domestic Violence Act considers some of the most difficult issues that magistrates must decide on. These include the <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> of the ‘abuser’ from the common home, emergency monetary relief for ‘victims’, and orders specifying the terms of contact with children. Magistrates’ opinions on these controversial issues vary greatly, with the result that victims get uneven assistance from the courts.

50|$|Those {{wishing to}} stretch this {{piercing}} to accommodate larger gauge jewelry should wait {{until at least}} two weeks after the initial piercing has fully healed. It is common for a frenum piercing to start to close soon after the jewelry has been removed. A fairly recent piercing may start to close in less than an hour. <b>Temporary</b> <b>removal</b> and replacement (for example, to accommodate a partner who finds it uncomfortable) may mean reinserting with a smaller gauge and then restretching {{to get back to the}} original, larger gauge. This tendency for the piercing to close up will diminish over time.|$|R

At a cost of $150 million, every piece of steel that makes up the suspended spans, except the towers and two main cables, were replaced; the non-suspended approach spans remained. New vertical cables were required due to the relocation of the stiffening trusses from above deck level to below deck level. Construction mostly occurred overnight with the bridge open to traffic during the day, but many full-weekend closures were necessary. the replacement portion {{of the project was}} completed in February 2017.|$|R
