40|$|Included {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of the Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument are a number of noxious weeds for which the BLM mandates control. In addition to listed weeds are nonnative <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> [Bromus tectorum and Bromus rubens), which can potentially convert native ecosystems to biologically impoverished annual grasslands. Although <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> occur virtually throughout the new Monument, they remain at relatively low biomass, with denser stands patchily distributed in former disturbances due to agriculture, road development, and fire. We discuss case studies indicating that this type of distribution often precedes habitat conversion by <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and we review various investigations related to how and why coverage expands. Measures should be taken to monitor the spread of <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and management strategies related to road development, tourism, fire, grazing, and habitat alteration and restoration should be consistent with the need to contain the distributions and abundances of these destructive weeds...|$|R

40|$|Fine fuels from non-native, annual <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> have {{overcome}} native plants {{across much of}} Zion Canyon in Zion National Park. This invasion threatens the single road that provides access into—and escape from—the canyon, creating a threat to human life should a large wildfi re occur there. In addition, native riparian plant communities in Zion Canyon have been degraded by non-native plants, and recurrent fire caused by annual grasses could further reduce native plant diversity. Results from {{this study suggest that}} burning can have a more lasting effect than annual mowing in reducing fine fuel loads, extending the period between repeated maintenance treatments. When burning is coupled with fall herbicide application, added control can extend the maintenance interval even further through reduction of <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> density...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{tests have}} shown that two or two and {{one-half}} pounds of grain daily will winter heifer calves well, which are to be full fed for an early market either after wintering or following wintering and grazing without grain 75 to 100 days. This wintering phase was preparatory to grazing and feeding. Comparisons are being made of full feeding in the dry lot and feeding on bluestem <b>grass</b> and <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> of both the well-wintered and rough-wintered heifers. The objectives of this work with heifer calves are: 1. - To determine the best methods of utilizing grass in fattening heifers. 2 - To develope systems of fattening heifers that may be adapted to varying farm and ranch conditions. Dehydrated alfalfa and dehydrated <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> pellets were compared with soybean meal, cottonseed meal and linseed meal as protein supplements in the winter rations...|$|R

40|$|The study {{reported}} herein {{was carried out}} by cooperation of the Departments of Agronomy and Animal Nutrition. The lignification {{study reported}} was conducted with three <b>grasses,</b> viz, Timothy, <b>Brome</b> and Reed Canary grass, while the digestibility study was conducted with Timothy only. A method of estimating the percentage of lignified area in plant tissue is described and has been used throughout the study. The percentage of lignified area in the stem increased as the plant matured. In Timothy and <b>Brome</b> <b>grass</b> the percentage of lignified area increased as one progressed up the culm. With Reed Canary grass the reverse was true in stages at which rapid growth was taking place. After rapid growth had ceased, the situation was found in Timothy and <b>Brome</b> <b>grass.</b> Feeding trials showed decreasing digestibility with increasing maturity. Study of ttie fecal slides indicated that all undigested plant tissue was lignified. The percentage of lignified area in the stem accounted for approximately 50 % of the undigested Dry Matter of the feeding trial...|$|R
50|$|The California vole is herbivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} grasses and sedges, {{supplemented}} by other flowering herbs. Preferred foods include wild oats, ryegrass, and <b>brome</b> <b>grass,</b> although {{all of these}} are introductions from Europe, and therefore cannot represent the animal's original diet. They can become an agricultural pest, causing widespread damage especially to fields of artichokes, but also to crops such as alfalfa, potatoes, and asparagus.|$|R

Intact stands of native plants are found around the coastline including nitre-bush and marsh saltbush shrubland. Other native species include ruby saltbush, Australian hollyhock, climbing lignum, variable groundsel and bower spinach.|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the combining ability among cultivars of forage species, commonly sown in temperate regions of Argentina using a short rotation system. Three genetically diverse cultivars of prairie <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> (Bromus catharticus, cv Copetona, cv Ñandú and cv Tango), a white clover cultivar (Trifolium repens, cv Lucero) and a red clover cultivar (T. pratense, cv Tropero) were evaluated. A randomized complete block design experiment was established in 2005. The treatments included five monocultures and ten binary mixtures. The experiment was harvested 6 times over an 18 -month period. Cumulative dry matter yield (kg?ha– 1 ) was calculated as {{the sum of the}} six individual harvests. Diallel analysis provided estimates of the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA). Red clover in monoculture and mixtures produced the highest yields, with significant positive GCA effects (P P P P < 0. 01). Given the short-term nature of this study, we must limit our inference to short-term pastures (< 2 years). Under these conditions, red clover had the best combination with prairie <b>brome</b> <b>grass...</b>|$|R
40|$|Swine {{experiment}} I, page 43, {{reported the}} results of feeding mustard seed oil meal to fattening pigs on alfalfa pasture, when mixed with tankage and other protein supplements. Pigs were fed with protein supplement mixtures in which the mustard seed oil meal composed as much as 50 percent of the supplement. The results of feeding it in such large proportions were so satisfactory that it was desired to ascertain whether it were possible to increase further the amount of mustard seed meal in the mixture with tankage and still get good results. Consequently two lots of pigs were fed with an increased percentage of mustard seed oil meal. In addition last year in connection with some other studies there was produced at the Kansas Experiment Station some dehydrated <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> meal. This meal had a protein content of about 20. 9 percent. As there was no information at hand concerning the use and palatability of <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> meal in swine feeding, it was thought advisable to compare it with dehydrated alfalfa meal...|$|R

Many occurrences are near the international border, and Border Patrol activities affect the habitat there.|$|R
