5|$|<b>The</b> <b>detainees</b> at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people’s detention.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the facility, some of the prisoners were {{selected}} for beatings or execution. Survivors reported that some of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were escorted to the brickyard, from which shots could be heard, and those detainees were not seen again. One surviving prisoner later reported that he witnessed the killing of one prisoner in the camp itself, when Serbian paramilitaries slit the victim's throat in front of detainees. Other prisoners were beaten during interrogations, were shot and wounded, or were otherwise abused. On 19 November, gradual transfer of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> to Sremska Mitrovica prison in Serbia started. These transfers caused a clash between Vujić and the Croatian Serb TO, as the latter wanted to keep <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> under their control.|$|E
5|$|In the camp, <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> {{suffered}} from tropical diseases and inadequate food and clothing. Jewish {{organizations such as}} the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Jewish Agency, and the Zionist Federation, sent food, clothing, medicine, and religious items to <b>the</b> <b>detainees.</b> Initially, a ban on interaction between the sexes was enforced; the men were held in a former jailhouse and the women in adjacent iron huts. After the ban was lifted, 60 children were born in the camp. In total, 128 prisoners died in the camp, and were buried in the Jewish section of St. Martin Cemetery. At the end of World War II, <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were given the choice of returning to their former homes in Europe or immigrating to Palestine. Most chose Palestine, and on August 6, 1945, 1,320 landed in Haifa.|$|E

5|$|To date, {{there have}} been two main {{investigations}} conducted by the MPCC in relation to Afghan detainees. The first was launched on 9 February 2007 after a formal complaint by Amir Attaran regarding the treatment of three specific detainees arrested in Kandahar region in April 2006. The findings from this investigation stated that CF members handled <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> appropriately, and were given medical treatment. However, the MPCC also found that the CF failed to conduct an investigation into how one of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> became injured, contrary to normal direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{camp was}} closed {{immediately}} {{after a visit}} by foreign journalists in early August. On 6 or 7 August 1992, <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> at Omarska were divided into groups and transported in buses to different destinations. About 1,500 people were transported on twenty buses.|$|E
5|$|About 25 {{people were}} arrested {{in the first few}} days, {{including}} 196 workers; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks. Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led to the death of innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
50|$|An accuser of <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> {{has since}} recanted his {{statement}} about <b>the</b> <b>detainee’s</b> connection to anti-tank mines and now claims <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> was {{not connected to}} setting anti-tank mines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} primary factors favor release or transfer ::a. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> {{does not}} consider himself {{an enemy of the}} United States. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> has never believed that the United States. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> has never believed that the United States is an enemy of Afghanistan. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> reiterated that he never fought with or shot a gun at anyone.::b. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> advised {{that he did not know}} much about Usama bin Laden and had only heard of him on <b>the</b> radio. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> has never seen Usama bin Laden.::c. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> said that he is not against the United States in any way.

5|$|On 31 May, {{just after}} the King of Bahrain had called for {{dialogue}} without preconditions to begin in early July the military National Safety Court issued an order for Rajab's arrest {{along with those of}} prominent Al Wefaq parliamentarians. Rajab was accused of spreading false news and statements about the situation in Bahrain and promoting hatred and disrespect of a specific religious sect, in addition to humiliating the king of Bahrain. All <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were released the same day.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} effectively illegalised the ROIA {{and led to}} {{the immediate}} release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the money they had to pay <b>the</b> <b>detainees,</b> who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>detainee’s</b> accusers has recanted {{his story}} about <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> giving him mines. The accuser now claims <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> {{did not give}} him mines, but {{that the person who}} {{previously}} resided in the house left the mines at his residence. He also says <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> did not pass him information on how to detonate mines.|$|R
2500|$|... "In June 2002, <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> was {{personally}} interviewed by Yosri Fouda, an investigative journalist for Al-Jazeera television. The interview {{took place over}} the course of 48 hours in Karachi, Pakistan. Also present at the meeting was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a senior al Qaida planner. Fouda conducted the interview in person with both <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> and KSM. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> and KSM detailed how the 9/11 attacks were planned and executed {{during the course of the}} interview. KSM identified <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> as <b>the</b> coordinator of the 9/11 attacks. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> displayed items he claimed were [...] "souvenirs" [...] of the 9/11 attacks. The items included: an air navigation map of the American eastern seaboard, flight simulator CD-Roms and Boeing manuals and a flight instruction book <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> claimed had 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta's handwritten notes. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> stated Mohamed Atta left them in the Hamburg, Germany, apartment he shared with <b>the</b> <b>detainee.</b> <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> stated that he later met with Atta in July, 2001 in Madrid, Spain, to finalize the operational details of the 9/11 plot. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> stated he received a phone call on 29 August 2001 from Atta that gave the date for the 9/11 attacks. After learning this, <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> ordered active al Qaida cells in Europe and elsewhere to evacuate and then he fled to Pakistan.|$|R

5|$|Two {{people were}} arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities. Of those arrested in 1997, one was a male {{permanent}} resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who had used the other person, a female Singaporean, as a collaborator. Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were deported, {{along with}} their families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E

5|$|The Gospić {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 100–120 civilians in Gospić, Croatia {{during the last two}} weeks of October 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The majority of the victims were ethnic Serbs, arrested in Gospić and the nearby coastal town of Karlobag. Most of them were arrested on 16–17 October. Some of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were taken to the Perušić barracks and executed in Lipova Glavica near the town, while others were shot in the Pazarište area of Gospić. The killings were ordered by the Secretary of Lika Crisis Headquarters, Tihomir Orešković, and the commander of the 118th Infantry Brigade of the Croatian National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Mirko Norac.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault and}} {{security}} elements moved on foot towards the first crash area, passing through heavy fire, and occupied buildings south and {{southwest of the}} downed helicopter. They fought to establish defensive positions {{so as not to}} be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire, while treating their wounded, and worked to free the pilot's body from the downed helicopter. With <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October, SAO Krajina police picked up 53 civilians in Hrvatska Dubica. Most of them were Croats, but there were several Serbs and Muslims by nationality. They were told they were being taken to a meeting, but they were {{detained}} under armed guard in the town's fire station. During the day, eleven people escaped or were released, either because they were Serbs or because they had Serb relatives. On 21 October, SAO Krajina forces moved 43 detainees from Hrvatska Dubica. <b>The</b> <b>detainees</b> were placed on a bus and told {{that they would be}} taken to Glina and released in a prisoner exchange. However the group, all of them Croats except for two Serbs, were taken to Krečane and killed. In the same period, an additional 24 civilians from villages around Hrvatska Dubica were killed by Serb forces at unknown locations.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August, {{a convoy}} {{carrying}} about 600 detainees to Abu Zaabal prison near Cairo resulted {{in at least}} 35 deaths. The interior ministry said that <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> tried {{to escape from the}} convoy and took an officer hostage. They then said that police fired tear gas back at them and <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> {{died as a result of}} suffocation. However, the Muslim Brotherhood disputed the claim and said that its supporters were killed in cold blood and called for an international inquiry into the incident.|$|E
