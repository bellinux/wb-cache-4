50|$|The {{reduction}} of reliance on nuclear plants {{has so far}} had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels and on electricity imports from France. However, in good wind Germany exports to France; in January 2015 the average price was €29/MWh in Germany, and €39/MWh in France. One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been {{the lack of an}} accompanying investment in power infrastructure (SüdLink) to bring the power to market. The <b>transmission</b> <b>constraint</b> sometimes causes Germany to pay Danish wind power to stop producing; in October/November 2015 this amounted to 96 GWh costing 1.8 million euros. Different Länder have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the Energiewende have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills.

50|$|This entire {{project was}} built in the 1970s and 1980s in order to provide California and the Southwest with excess {{hydropower}} from the Pacific Northwest without actually having to construct any new power plants. During the cold Pacific Northwest winters, power is sent north due to heater use. This transfer reverses in the hot, dry summers, when many people in the South run air conditioners. In order to do this the maximum south-to-north transmission capacity is 5,400 MW for most parts, but between Los Banos substation and Gates substation, there were only two 500 kV lines. The capacity at this electricity bottleneck was only 3,900 MW, and this was identified in the 1990s as a trouble spot, but noone acted upon it. This bottleneck was one of the leading causes of the California electricity crisis in 2000-2001. To remedy this problem, WAPA along with several utilities built a third 500 kV line between these two substations to eliminate this <b>transmission</b> <b>constraint</b> and raise the maximum south-to-north transmission capacity to 5,400 MW. The project was completed under budget and on time on December 21, 2004.

The study developed and compiled metrics of electricity transmission performance related to the magnitude and impact of congestion (e.g. the number of hours per year where the <b>transmission</b> <b>constraint</b> is loaded to its maximum safe operating level, etc.). Based on these data, the DOE identified three categories of congested areas which have higher levels of transmission congestion for the Eastern Interconnection and the Western Interconnection (ERCOT is excluded from these studies as the system is not under the purview of federal authority; no interstate commerce). The study classified areas of concern into three categories: Critical Congestion Areas, Congestion Areas of Concern, and Conditional Congestion Areas. [...] A Critical Congestion Area is an area which is “critically important to remedy existing or growing congestion problems because the current and/or projected effects of the congestion are severe.” Congestion Areas of Concern are areas where a “large-scale congestion problem exists or may be emerging, but more information and analysis appear to be needed to determine the magnitude of the problem and the likely relevance of transmission expansion and other solutions.” Conditional Congestion Areas are areas where there is “some transmission congestion at present, but significant congestions would result if large amounts of new generation resources were to be developed without simultaneous development of associated transmission capacity.” ...|$|E

In the one-line case, this argument depends on an untested hypothesis while in the three-line case, the Nash equilibrium was misidentified. Finally, the argument that financial transmission rights (and TCCs in particular) will have zero market value is refuted by modeling the possibility of their purchase by generators. This allows transmission owners, who initially own the TCCs, to capture some of the congestion rent. In fact when total capacity exceeds line capacity by more than {{the capacity of the}} largest generator, TCCs should attain their perfectly competitive value, thereby curbing the market power of generators. ...|$|E

We validate the proposed scenario selection algorithm by demonstrating that it outperforms alternative reserve commitment approaches in a 225 bus model of California with 130 generators and 375 transmission lines.
