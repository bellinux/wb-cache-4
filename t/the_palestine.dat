5|$|Following a {{significant}} easing of the closure policy in 2010, {{the economy of}} Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels {{during the height of}} the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including <b>the</b> <b>Palestine,</b> Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E
5|$|Among others, Iran's {{supreme leader}} Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed a Zionist {{conspiracy}} for the row over the cartoons.

5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Liberation Organization in a display of unity with <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E

5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries.

5|$|In 1962, Arafat and {{his closest}} companions {{migrated}} to Syria—a country sharing a border with Israel—which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt. Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time, but none were fighters. In Syria, {{he managed to}} recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Liberation Army (PLA), the regular military force of <b>the</b> <b>Palestine</b> Liberation Organization (PLO), which {{was created by the}} Arab League in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from al-Assifa, Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions.
