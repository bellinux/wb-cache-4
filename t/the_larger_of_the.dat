5|$|Arbroath has two {{secondary}} schools, Arbroath High School and Arbroath Academy. The {{high school}} (the older of the two), was originally a grammar {{school and the}} academy a comprehensive. The academy is located near the Mayfield area and the high school near Keptie Pond. Both schools are well regarded with exam results along reading and writing performance indicators above the national average. Arbroath High is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two with around 1,200 pupils, and the Academy being smaller with around 600 pupils.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Tacoma eclipsed Seattle to become the largest port in the state and 7th largest in the nation, but fell behind ports in Los Angeles and nearby Vancouver. In 2009, Seattle regained its title as <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ports, but both {{suffered}} losses in overall cargo volume and revenue. Tacoma lost Maersk to Seattle after it merged with CMA-CGM in 2009, but three years later attracted an alliance of three major international shippers from Seattle who had comprised 20 percent of cargo for the port.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{estimates}} for Kepler-9b's mass were refined by the W. M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In doing so, scientists found that Kepler-9b is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two gas planets {{discovered in the}} Kepler-9 system, although in mass it is smaller than planet Saturn.|$|E

5|$|The AERA {{essentially}} collapsed {{after its}} acrimonious convention in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations {{were created in}} its aftermath. Two days after the convention, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). In November 1869, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe and their allies formed the competing American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The AWSA initially was <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two organizations, but it declined in strength during the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{northern}} wing originally {{contained a}} dining hall, {{but this was}} later divided up to make more luxurious quarters for the Prince Bishop. This area {{is also home to}} the two chapels of the college. The Norman Chapel dates from the 11th century and is the oldest accessible part of the castle, and retains its original Saxon architectural style. The Tunstal Chapel is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two; it dates from the 15th century and is named after Cuthbert Tunstal. Both chapels are used for worship within the college.|$|E

5|$|The sejms in Warsaw {{were held}} in the Warsaw Castle, within the Chamber of Deputies (Hall of Three Pillars), with the upper Senate Chamber located {{literally}} above it. In the late 17th century, new quarters were constructed for the Chamber of Deputies, and were joined {{on the same level}} by the senate quarters in the mid-18th century. The new Senate Chamber was <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two, as it was intended to host both chambers during the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} sandy beaches at both St Mildred's Bay and West Bay. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beaches is at St Mildred's Bay, {{where it is}} {{possible}} to hire beach huts, deck chairs and jet-skis. The beach is a short distance from tennis courts and a golf putting course. At West Bay, there are many small rock pools, which are popular with children. Each beach has nearby cafés, restaurants and public houses, and a European Blue Flag Award is shared between them due to their cleanliness and safety.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} Faversham Abbey {{are the two}} barns at Abbey Farm. Minor Barn was built around 1425; Major Barn, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two, dates from 1476. Next to the barns is the Abbey Farmhouse, part of which dates from the 14th century. The Abbey Guest house, {{on the east side}} of the Abbey's Outer Gateway, has survived as Arden's House. This house, now a private residence in Abbey Street, was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551. The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614, with additional houses being built by Henry Wright in 1823.|$|E

5|$|Group C lies to the {{southwest}} of Group B and east of Group E. Group C is arranged around two large structures (C1 and C2). It possesses two small plazas; the East Plaza is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two, enclosing an area {{to the east of}} the main temple, Pyramid C1. The East Plaza was accessed via a narrow alley that ran between a large, low platform and a high-status residential structure with a patio (C8). An inset stairway climbed outside of the retaining wall of Group C and accessed the East Plaza between the high-status residence and a platform to its east. The West Plaza is located behind Platform C2 and is enclosed to the north by three platforms (C9, C10 and C17).|$|E
5|$|Players of Donkey Kong Country control {{one of two}} {{characters}}: Donkey Kong or {{his nephew}} Diddy. The player can switch between characters if they are both on the screen. Donkey is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two, and can defeat enemies more easily while Diddy is faster and more agile. In several levels, players can gain assistance from various animals, who are found by breaking open crates. These helpers include Rambi the Rhino, Expresso the Ostrich, Enguarde the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot. Each animal {{can be found in}} an appropriately themed level: for example, Enguarde can only be found underwater, and Squawks is found in one cave level. Some animals can also give players access to bonus games.|$|E
5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains. They were also <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E

5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E
5|$|The Kootenay rises on the {{northeast}} slopes of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia, and flows initially southeast through the valleys of Kootenay National Park. Its first few kilometers (miles) are quiet, threading slowly {{through a series of}} marshes and small lakes. The river becomes significantly enlarged as it reaches the confluence with the Vermilion River, which is actually <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two where they meet near the settlement of Kootenay Crossing. It continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, and swings southwards into a gorge at the confluence with the White River.|$|E
5|$|The Studios on Broadway, {{contains}} seven high-definition studios, {{claimed by}} Peel Media {{to be the}} largest such facility in Europe. The largest studio has an area of , {{making it one of the}} biggest in western Europe. Fitting began in 2010 at a cost of £22million, in time for the BBC's move in summer 2011. The seven studios vary in size; the large studios are on the ground floor, and the smaller studios on the first floor. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two audio studios, sitting on hydraulic jacks to insulate it from noise generated in the surrounding studios, is dedicated to the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The studio block contains offices and the glass-fronted, 16-storey Holiday Inn hotel.|$|E

5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and halfway up its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front {{exterior}} wall of <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, one on each side. Wooden construction is found throughout the tower, its arches, {{and the rest of the}} schoolhouse, save the limestone and cement foundation. At the bottom of each of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E
