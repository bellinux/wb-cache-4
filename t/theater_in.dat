5|$|At this time, Yiddish <b>theater</b> <b>in</b> London meant amateur clubs. The {{arrival of}} {{professional}} Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish <b>theater</b> <b>in</b> London {{to a new}} level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage.

5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's <b>theater</b> <b>in</b> line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the <b>theater</b> <b>in</b> the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The <b>theater</b> <b>in</b> the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E
