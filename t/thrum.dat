25|$|<b>Thrum</b> Hall {{was run by}} {{trustees}} from 1921.|$|E

25|$|Pin and <b>thrum</b> heterostyly {{occurs in}} dimorphic species of Primula, such as P. vulgaris. There {{are two types}} of flower. The pin flower has a long style bearing the stigma at the mouth and the stamens halfway down; and the <b>thrum</b> flower has a short style, so the stigma is halfway up the tube and the stamens are at the mouth. So when an insect in search of nectar inserts its {{proboscis}} into a long-style flower, the pollen from the stamens stick to the proboscis in exactly the part that will later touch the stigma of the short-styled flower, and vice versa.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegraph}} wires <b>thrummed,</b> <b>thrummed,</b> <b>thrummed</b> above them; {{the rails}} were glaring hard lines; the goldenrod smelled dusty. Across the track was a pasture of dwarf clover and sparse lawn cut by earthy cow-paths; beyond its placid narrow green, the rough immensity of new stubble, jagged with wheat-stacks like huge pineapples.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I am sure I shall like <b>Thrums,</b> {{though those}} teas to the {{congregation}} {{are a little}} trying. Do you know, <b>Thrums</b> {{is the only place}} I was ever in where it struck me that the men are cleverer than the women." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{attendance}} {{record of}} 29,153 {{was set in}} a third round Challenge Cup tie against Wigan on 21 March 1959. By {{the time of the}} Taylor Report, <b>Thrum</b> Hall's capacity was reduced to 9,832.|$|E
25|$|Another most {{important}} {{property of the}} heterostyly system is physiological. If <b>thrum</b> pollen is placed on a <b>thrum</b> stigma, or pin pollen on a pin stigma, the reproductive cells are incompatible and relatively little seed is set. Effectively, this ensures out-crossing, as described by Darwin. Quite a lot is now known about the underlying genetics; the system is controlled {{by a set of}} closely linked genes which act as a single unit, a super-gene. All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrum</b> Hall was a rugby league stadium on Hanson Lane in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. It was {{the home}} of Halifax for 112 years. The site on which the ground stood is now {{occupied}} by a supermarket.|$|E

25|$|Halifax sold <b>Thrum</b> Hall for £1.5 {{million to}} Asda for a superstore {{development}} in 1998, and moved {{across town to}} their present home, the Shay Stadium. The supermarket chain closed their existing store in Battinson Road, when the new store finally opened after a protracted legal battle in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Halifax was {{hit hard}} by the {{financial}} situation of the late 1960s, and 1970s. In 1970, a concert was held at <b>Thrum</b> Hall {{in an attempt to}} alleviate these financial troubles. Adverse weather conditions meant that only around 3,000 arrived to watch the 'Halifax Pop and Blues Concert' which made a loss of £6,000.|$|E
25|$|The site {{measured}} 55,000 square {{yards and}} included a cricket pitch and bowling greens. The rugby stadium was opened on 18 September 1886 by Alderman Riley, who kicked off before the Halifax v Hull F.C. match. Forward Ernest Williamson scored {{the first try}} (his only try for Halifax) and the home side {{went on to win}} in front of a crowd of around 8,000. As <b>Thrum</b> Hall was built on an old hilltop farm, it had a distinctive slope of 4 yards away from the main grandstand touchline.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{now you are}} afraid--now {{when the}} deed is done, when for me {{there can be no}} turning back.

25|$|Motorcycle {{speedway}} racing {{has been}} staged at two venues in Halifax. In the pioneering days of 1928–1930 a track operated at <b>Thrum</b> Hall. A Halifax team {{took part in}} the English Dirt Track League of 1929. Speedway returned to Halifax at the Shay Stadium in 1949 and operated until 1951. The team operated as the Halifax Nomads in 1948 racing three away fixtures. The Halifax Dukes, the name they took once the Shay was opened, operated in the National League Third Division in 1949 before moving up to the Second Division in 1950. Riders including Arthur Forrest, moved on to Bradford. The Dukes re-emerged in 1965 as founder members of the British League and operated there for many years before the team moved en bloc to Odsal Stadium, Bradford. The steeply banked bends of the track at the Shay have been buried under stands at either end when the spectator facilities were squared off.|$|E
500|$|In 1598, {{there was}} a {{reference}} to cricket in an Italian-English dictionary by Giovanni Florio. His definition of the word sgillare was: [...] "to make a noise as a cricket, to play cricket-a-wicket, and be merry". Florio is the first writer known to have defined [...] "cricket" [...] {{in terms of both}} an insect and a game. In a later edition of his dictionary in 1611, Florio infers that [...] "to play cricket-a-wicket" [...] has sexual associations with references to frittfritt, defined [...] "as we say cricket a wicket, or gigaioggie", and dibatticare, defined [...] "to <b>thrum</b> a wench lustily till the bed cry giggaioggie".|$|E
500|$|Reception to 21st Century Breakdown {{has been}} {{generally}} favorable, according to aggregating website Metacritic, which reported {{a rating of}} 70/100 based on 30 critical reviews. [...] Dan Silver of The Observer awarded the record four stars out of five and likened it to both Bruce Springsteen's music and the avant-garde writing of Chuck Palahniuk. Rolling Stones David Fricke called 21st Century Breakdown [...] "a compound bomb of classic-rock ecstasy, no-mercy punk assault and pop-song wiles; it's like The Clash's London Calling, The Who's Quadrophenia and Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade all compressed into 18 songs". Dan Cairns of The Times concluded: [...] "Lyrically, it may succeed in capturing the contradictions, vulnerabilities and longing for harmony that <b>thrum</b> through Armstrong, Dirnt and Cool, their country, and humanity as a whole. But its real triumph, {{in an age of}} trimming, of market testing, of self-censorship and lowest common denominators, is not simply to aim insanely high, but {{to make it to the}} summit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pencil roving {{is a type}} of roving {{that has}} been drawn until it {{is the size of a}} fat pencil. It can be used by spinners with minimal {{drafting}} (withdrawing fibers from a clump). Knitters also use pencil roving, similar to Lopi style yarns, or when making a <b>thrummed</b> item. (Regular roving can also be used in <b>thrummed</b> knitting.) ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the other}} Jacobites, what of them? Hi, where are you, Corp? Here he comes, grinning, in his spleet new uniform, to demand our tickets of us. He {{is now the}} railway porter. Since Tommy left <b>Thrums</b> [...] "steam" [...] had arrived in it, and Corp had by nature such a gift for giving luggage the twist which breaks {{everything}} inside as you dump it down that he was inevitably appointed porter. There was no travelling to <b>Thrums</b> without a ticket. At Tilliedrum, which was the junction for <b>Thrums,</b> you showed your ticket and were then locked in. A hundred yards from <b>Thrums.</b> Corp leaped upon the train and fiercely demanded your ticket. At the station he asked you threateningly whether you had given up your ticket. Even his wife was afraid of him at such times, and had her ticket ready in her hand.|$|R

500|$|Anime News Network's Jonathan Mays criticized Steven Foster's dubbing of the film. He said, [...] "Foster {{carelessly}} omits critical details, completely rewrites some scenes, misinterprets emotions, {{and even}} adds new dialogue where the original track had silence". In an Anime News Network interview, Foster said he [...] "made some changes {{to make the}} jokes more accessible". Mays also said, [...] "The animation is breathtaking. Shinkai's backgrounds have very few equals. The character designs look uninspired, but paired with the animator's beautifully realized worlds, the generic appearance fades into the magnificence of the scene." [...] He said Shinkai's use of lighting is [...] "masterful", [...] "incredibly realistic" [...] and conveys the characters' moods well. He called the characters [...] "unoriginal". DVD Verdict's Rob Lineberger commended the music, saying [...] "the simple score infuses the animation with meaning. Solitary piano notes are sluggish, as though the pianist lacked the enthusiasm needed {{to pick up his}} fingers. When the action kicks in, it arrives with a sonic punch from 5.1 speakers. Rockets scream around you, birds move overhead, engines <b>thrum</b> quietly in your wake. The soundtrack does what it is supposed to do: transport you to another world".|$|E

[...] Yorkshire played three County Championship matches there, in July 1888 against Gloucestershire, August 1889 against Middlesex and Kent in June 1897, while they played Essex in a non-championship fixture in July 1894. Kent were bowled out for 74 in their match, with Bobby Peel taking 8 for 93.
