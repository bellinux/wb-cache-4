One independent study has demonstrated training with these cranks can improve cycling efficiency. The manufacturer also claims that this change can also be useful to aid in running improvement, help prevent injuries in runners, improve core strength development, and are useful for the rehabilitation of lower extremity injuries, especially in the athlete. The manufacturer claims these cranks {{have been used as}} a training tool by several World and Olympic Champions in both cycling and triathlon and several professional sports teams including MLB and NFL teams, and other uses.|$|E

The banana spider myth claims that the Huntsman spider lays its eggs in banana flower blossoms, resulting in spiders inside the tip of bananas, waiting to terrorize an unsuspecting consumer. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to explain why monkeys allegedly peel bananas from the [...] "wrong" [...] end. The clock spider urban legend from around 2002 began with a discussion on an Internet message board based on pictures of an allegedly [...] "clock-sized" [...] Sparassid (Huntsman) spider on a wall.

A writer for MTV News found the video to be [...] "dark and cinematic, it's {{almost as if}} you swallowed an entire feature length film in 3 minutes." [...] Another writer for the rock magazine Blender was negative towards the video saying that it [...] "makes singer Amy Lee's soul bearing that much more drawn-out with ill-advised slow motion shots of (yep) decay and destruction.

500|$|Though the All-China Women's Federation {{is officially}} labeled an NGO, its longstanding {{relationship}} with the CPC means that the party still has interests in the federation and its members. [...] The four levels of the federation still coincide with the state administrative system. [...] The highest ranking body of the ACWF is the National Congress of Women which meets every five years. The National Congress Women studies reports sent to them from the Executive Committee of the ACWF, decide the goals for the women’s movements, make changes to the constitution, and elect the Executive Committee and Standing Committees of the ACWF. Under this national level, the provincial level’s women’s congresses meet every three years to select their Executive and Standing Committees. However the local level must also carry out the directive and report to the CPC committee in addition to following the ACWF. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to give the organization a dual structure of carrying out party orders and informing the government of women’s interests.|$|E

Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death.

This hand has more muscle and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable.

2500|$|Many social {{networking}} services, such as Facebook, provide the user {{with a choice}} of who can view their profile. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information. Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as [...] "friends" [...] to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents. To edit information on a certain {{social networking}} service account, the social networking sites require you to log in or provide a password. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.|$|E

It was alleged by plainclothes policemen who were in the audience that Chambers allowed audience members to touch her with their hands and mouths during her show called [...] "Feel the Magic". She was released on $2,000 bail and the charges were later dropped.

2500|$|A {{taking of}} {{property}} {{must be accompanied}} by payment of [...] "just compensation" [...] to the [...] owner. In theory, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to put the owner in the same position [...] "pecuniarily" [...] that he would have been in had his property not been taken. But in practice courts have limited compensation to the property's fair market value, considering its highest and best use. But though rarely granted, this is not the exclusive measure of compensation; see United States v. Kimball Laundry (business losses in temporary takings) and United States v. Pewee Coal Co. (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine seized during World War II). In most takings owners are not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that, though incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the courts to be noncompensable in eminent domain. The same is true of attorneys' and appraisers fees. But as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have been made compensable by state legislative enactments, and may be partially covered by provisions of the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act.|$|E
2500|$|Physical {{contact between}} two {{versions}} of the same person in the programme can lead to an energy discharge that shorts out the [...] "time differential". This is apparently due to a (fictional) principle known as the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, and was seen when the past and future versions of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart touched hands in Mawdryn Undead. The Doctor's incarnations do not appear to suffer this effect when encountering each other and shaking hands. This has never been explained. An essay in the About Time episode guides by Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood suggests that Time Lords are somehow exempt from the effect by their very nature. Rose Tyler is seen holding an infant version of herself in [...] "Father's Day", with no visible energy discharge, but the contact does allow the Reapers to enter the church in which the Doctor and several others are taking refuge. While doing a live commentary on the episode at the 2006 Bristol Comic Expo, episode author Paul Cornell said that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to be due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, even though it is not mentioned by name. He suggested that the lack of a spark may be down {{to the fact that the}} Time Lords were no longer around to manage anomalies.|$|E
2500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both {{reported that}} [...] "The End" [...] had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale, stating [...] "I'm still wrestling with my feelings about 'The End'... I thought {{most of it}} worked like gangbusters. ... But as someone who did spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to be such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (blah, blah, blah), why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ... Once Jack stepped into the church it looked like he was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music—just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another." ...|$|E
