5|$|The {{field for}} the main event {{consisted}} only of 30 trucks {{instead of the usual}} 36, with the top 20 <b>trucks</b> <b>in</b> the owner's points standings guaranteed a spot. To determine the field, two-lap qualifying runs were held, which determined the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on the pole for the heats, and the highest non-locked-in truck were transferred in to the main event until there were 25 <b>trucks</b> <b>in</b> the field. For drivers that did not qualify via the heats, the top four in a last-chance qualifier advance, with the final spot reserved for the most recent series champion, and if that spot is vacant, the fifth-place finisher in the LCQ would qualify for the main event.|$|E

5|$|The {{trucking}} industry {{serves the}} American economy by transporting {{large quantities of}} raw materials, works in process, and finished goods over land—typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers. Trucks are also used in the construction industry, as dump trucks and portable concrete mixers move the large amounts of rocks, dirt, concrete, and other building materials used in construction. <b>Trucks</b> <b>in</b> America {{are responsible for the}} majority of freight movement over land and are tools in the manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing industries.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Nordmann joined Mercedes-Benz in 1950, {{initially}} {{working in}} sales. He later became {{head of the}} sales department and, in 1968, head of worldwide services. In January 1971 he was appointed president of Mercedes-Benz in North America and Canada, retiring in January 1981. Despite his retirement, he continued {{to hold a position}} as company director. During his tenure with Mercedes, Nordmann was an early mentor of Jürgen Schrempp, who later became {{the chief executive officer of}} Daimler AG. Under Nordmann's leadership, Mercedes sales in the United States increased from 30,000 cars in 1970 to 43,600 cars in 1972, a 0.4% U.S. market share. To further expand the market presence in North America, Mercedes in 1976 opened a facility in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1977 Daimler bought the Euclid Company of Ohio and Freightliner <b>Trucks</b> <b>in</b> 1981.|$|E
5|$|Fares {{were stored}} in a money room at 370 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn {{starting}} in 1951, when the building opened as a headquarters for the New York City Board of Transportation. The building {{is close to the}} lines of all three subway divisions (the IRT, BMT, and IND) and thus was a convenient location to collect fares, including tokens and cash, via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room {{in the basement of the}} building. Fare collection and transport was originally performed using armored trucks, and the money trains were replaced by armored <b>trucks</b> <b>in</b> 2006.|$|E

5|$|Following {{break-out}} by the US 1st and 3rd Armies {{from the}} beachhead during the Battle of Normandy after Operation Cobra on 25 July 1944, Adolf Hitler ordered an immediate counterattack against Allied {{forces in the}} form of Operation Lüttich. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley—the commanding general of the US 12th Army Group—was notified of the counterattack in advance through signals intercepted via Ultra radio intercepts and deciphering and thus prepared his troops and their commanders to defeat this counteroffensive and to encircle as much of the Wehrmacht force as possible. By the afternoon of 7 August, Operation Lüttich had been defeated by concerted, large-scale fighter-bomber air strikes against the German tanks and <b>trucks.</b> <b>In</b> the process, forces of the German 7th Army became further enveloped by the Allied advance out of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The truck-mounted Katyushas were {{installed}} on ZiS-6 6×4 trucks, {{as well as}} the two-axle ZiS-5 and ZiS-5V. In 1941, a small number of BM-13 launchers were mounted on STZ-5 artillery tractors. A few were also tried on KV tank chassis as the KV-1K, but this was a needless waste of heavy armour. Starting in 1942, they were also mounted on various British, Canadian and U.S. Lend-Lease <b>trucks,</b> <b>in</b> which case they were sometimes referred to as BM-13S. The cross-country performance of the Studebaker US6 2½ ton truck was so good that it became the GAU's standard mounting in 1943, designated BM-13N (normalizovanniy, 'standardized'), and more than 1,800 of this model were manufactured by the end of World War II. After World War II, BM-13s were based on Soviet-built ZiL-151 trucks.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum is a defunct {{trucking}} {{museum in}} Middlebury, Connecticut, United States. Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, it was non-profit {{organization dedicated to}} trucking that focused on trucks of the 1950s. The museum was dedicated on September 23, 2002 and housed in a 32,000 square foot building. It featured a collection of historic and antique vehicles including the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company dump truck. Among the <b>trucks</b> <b>in</b> the museum were Mack Trucks, GMC and Autocar Company trucks, including a 1963 Mack B61 motivated Guerrera to found the museum. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum also featured a collection of toy trucks, hats, state license plates and images relating to trucking. Throughout its entire operation, the museum ran a deficit and it closed after a 2009 fund raising campaign failed. The museum's final day of operation was on July 20, 2010. The {{economic impact of the}} museums closure was expected to be low, but according to Steven Frischling of the Boston Globe. the Golden Age of Trucking Museum made its mark on the auto world.|$|E

5|$|The longest {{interval}} between Yankees no-hitters {{was between the}} game pitched by Larsen on October 8, 1956 and Dave Righetti's no hitter on July 4, 1983, encompassing 26 years, 8 months, and 26 days. The shortest gap between such games fell between Allie Reynolds' two no-hitters in 1951, a gap of just 2 months and 16 days from July 12 till September 28. Reynolds is the only Yankees pitcher to throw multiple no-hitters in his career, and one of only six pitchers in Major League history to throw multiple no-hitters in a season along with Max Scherzer in 2015, Roy Halladay in 2010, Nolan Ryan in 1973, Virgil <b>Trucks</b> <b>in</b> 1952, and Johnny Vander Meer in 1938. The Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians have been no-hit by the Yankees {{more than any other}} franchise, each doing so three times. Notably, Reynolds' two no-hit victims in 1951 were the Red Sox and the Indians.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1946, Renault {{abandoned}} the production of heavy <b>trucks</b> <b>in</b> view of its financial troubles, and the company lost the position of France's market leader which it had before World War II. However, the rapid development and production concentration on that sector made Renault to seek ways {{to enter into the}} market. In 1950, the Renault's technical chief, Fernand Picard, elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine, taking advantage of the economies of scale, which proved unsuccessful. In 1953, the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers, starting with Somua and Latil. The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider (owner of Somua) and the Blum family (owner of Latil) had stakes in the new company. Initially, the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but, from 1957 onwards, Saviem-LRS appeared as marque's name on the company's products (the acronym representing the former marques Latil, Renault and Somua), which was simplified to Saviem in 1960. In 1959, Saviem became a whole-owned subsidiary of Renault. The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault's existing models (Goélette and Galion), new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach/bus production. With an aggressive market approach focussed in volume rather than quality, Saviem became the leader by sales in France.|$|E
