However, despite these achievements, Estrada only narrowly won over Lim in their electoral rematch in 2016. Recently, the City Government is planning to revise existing curfew ordinance since the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional on August 2017. Out of the three cities reviewed by the Supreme Court, namely: the City of Manila, Navotas and Quezon City; only the curfew ordinance of Quezon City was approved.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E

25|$|After the {{location}} of the railway was once again changed, there was still hope that Grand Valley could become a rival neighbour to Brandon. But late in June 1881 it became clear that Grand Valley would not have lasted as a city long term. A flood hit in late June, and as the city was built on a low-lying part of the river, flooded quickly and dramatically. Because Grand Valley was built on a low flood plain, and Brandon was built on the heights on the other side, it became apparent that Brandon was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> a city in the area.|$|E

He dissolved his partnership with his brother, and, with $14000 in capital, began seeking a location for his new tannery. He spent the summer of 1824 exploring the surrounding counties with his dog for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> his planned operations. He decided on a region in the very western part of Windham, in what is current day Prattsville, for its large forests of hemlock, which was necessary for tanning at the time, {{as well as its}} proximity to the Schoharie Creek. The Prattsville Commercial Building, built about 1824, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.|$|E

25|$|The British {{government}} had long deliberated about <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the landing of the Anglo-Russian expedition on the Dutch coast. Possible locations {{taken into consideration}} were the Scheldt estuary (where in 1809 the Walcheren Campaign was aimed at) and the area around Scheveningen (near The Hague) where the planners expected support from partisans of the former stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange. Eventually, it was decided however, to select the extreme {{northern part of the}} North Holland peninsula, because its shore was more easily accessible than other parts of the Dutch coast, that were encumbered with dangerous shoals and sandbanks; because it was only lightly defended, with only a few shore batteries at Den Helder; and because it offered the hope of capturing the northern squadron of the Batavian fleet, a most important strategic objective. Also, the British planners thought that the great city of Amsterdam could easily be approached and captured from this direction.|$|E
25|$|Before the American Revolution {{the upper}} class {{increasingly}} began to support the arts, particularly through a demand for portrait paintings. The demand for portraits made Philadelphia attractive to artists and many came to the city, including William Williams who introduced oil painting to another Philadelphia artist, Benjamin West. In 1805 an art collector, believing Philadelphia <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the encouragement of artistic taste, offered the city numerous paintings, sculptures, engravings and other art work. To accept the gift the city formed the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The Academy, the oldest art school and museum in the United States, helped establish many artists. Portraitist Charles Willson Peale and sculptor William Rush helped found the Academy of the Fine Arts and artists such as Thomas Eakins, Henry Ossawa Tanner {{and some of the}} members of the Philadelphia Ten studied there. The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art was founded in 1876 to maintain the art exhibits from the Centennial Exposition. The museum holds over 225,000 pieces of artwork including work by Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Marcel Duchamp. Not far from the Museum of Art is the Rodin Museum. The museum, founded in 1929, is the largest collection of Auguste Rodin work outside France. Planned nearby is a new museum intended to hold the collection of the Barnes Foundation. In 1923 Albert C. Barnes was outraged that his collection of paintings by Paul CÃ©zanne, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani was so poorly received by Philadelphians when put on display at the Academy of the Fine Arts that Barnes removed the collection and housed it in a building in Merion, Pennsylvania where Barnes enjoyed denying access to most Philadelphians. The controversial decision in 2002 to, against Barnes' wishes expressed in his will, move the collection to Philadelphia was based on financial reasons. In 1991, to promote Old City art galleries, the Old City Art Association began First Fridays. On the first Friday of every month, Old City galleries hold a collaborative open house night.|$|E

500|$|In February 1942, on {{advice from}} Lavarack that the Dutch East Indies would soon fall, Sturdee urged the Australian {{government}} that the 17,800 troops {{returning from the}} Middle East, originally bound for Java, be diverted to Australia.

When Prime Minister John Curtin backed his Chief of the General Staff, it brought him into conflict with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and United States President Franklin D.

500|$|Shortly after Fuller's death, her {{importance}} faded. Her obituary in {{the newspaper}} she had once edited, the Daily Tribune, said that her works had a few great sentiments, [...] "but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance". As biographer Abby Slater wrote, [...] "Margaret had been demoted {{from a position of}} importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept". Years later, Hawthorne's son Julian wrote, [...] "The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure." [...] In the 20th century, American writer Elizabeth Hardwick, former wife of Robert Lowell, wrote an essay called [...] "The Genius of Margaret Fuller" [...] (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller's, saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> intellectuals.|$|E
500|$|Byron had {{arranged}} for Allegra to be educated in the convent precisely because he, unlike his former lover Clairmont, thought favourably of the manners and attitudes of Italian women who had received convent educations. [...] He disapproved {{of what he called}} Clairmont's [...] "loose morals" [...] and [...] "Bedlam behavior" [...] and didn't want her to influence Allegra. He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy than she would in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would have a decent chance of marrying into high Italian society. He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall be a Christian and a married woman, if possible." [...] Her mother could see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent than she would with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest place for her with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
