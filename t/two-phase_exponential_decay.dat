Using a limited set of assumptions about the shape and emission frequency of extended defects, and taking as parameters the interstitial binding energies of extended defects versus their size, this model is able to predict {{a wide variety of}} experimental results. The model accounts for the whole extended defect evolution, from the initial small irregular clusters to the { 311 } defects and to the more stable dislocation loops. The model predicts the extended defect dissolution, supersaturation and defect size evolution with time, and it takes into account the thermally activated transformation of { 311 } defects into dislocation.

30|$|Soybean {{seeds are}} {{non-sterile}} and their bacterial population {{interferes with the}} enumeration of beneficial bacteria, {{making it difficult to}} assess survival under different conditions. Within this context, the principal aims of this work were: (1) to improve a selective media for the enumeration of B. japonicum recovered from inoculated soybean seeds; (2) to establish the most representative mathematical function for B. japonicum mortality on soybean seeds after inoculation; (3) to evaluate if environmental or physiological conditions modify B. japonicum mortality on soybean seeds; and (4) to create a new protocol for quality control of soybean inoculants. We successfully evaluated the combination of pentachloronitrobenzene and vancomycin added to the yeast-mannitol medium to inhibit most fungi and Gram-positive soybean microbiota, thus producing reliable counts of B. japonicum from inoculated soybean seeds. Percentages of recovery and survival factors were obtained and used to construct a <b>two-phase</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> non-linear regression function. High temperature and desiccation decreased these parameters, while the optimization of temperature and the use of osmoprotective compounds with inoculants increased them. The use of this protocol minimized heterogeneity between experiments and may be considered more reliable than the simple expression of direct colony count of bacteria recovered from seeds.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{surgical}} {{training is}} generally {{done with the}} teacher-student model using complex exercises. This study was performed to evaluate a new training model that emphasizes the repetition of simple procedures. METHODS: Laparoscopic surgery was performed in rabbits (n= 200) using conventional instruments. Gynaecologists (n= 10) and medical students (n= 10) performed a series of exercises during 20 full days training. Nephrectomy was chosen to evaluate and score laparoscopic skills, i. e. duration of surgery and complication rate, since it mimics the surgical challenge and involves dissection of major vessels. Each surgeon performed 20 nephrectomies, alternating left and right sides. RESULTS: Duration of surgery and complications decreased with training. For duration of surgery, a <b>two-phase</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> learning curve, with different decays for gynaecologists and students, was observed. Gynaecologists achieved shorter operating times than students for real and calculated times in the first procedure (P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 0001) and for calculated {{time in the last}} procedure (P= 0. 001). Severe complications were more frequent in students than in gynaecologists (P= 0. 0003). CONCLUSION: The rabbit nephrectomy model is suitable for training in laparoscopic surgery. Since it implies the repetition of short and well-defined exercises, progression is easier to monitor and the necessity for continuous supervision is less, making training less expensive. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Although {{intermittent}} {{episodes of}} low-level viremia are often observed in well-suppressed {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) -treated patients, {{the timing and}} amplitude of viral blips have never been examined in detail. We analyze here the dynamics of viral blips, i. e., plasma VL measurements of > 50 copies/ml, in 123 HAART-treated patients monitored for a mean of 2. 6 years (range, 5 months to 5. 3 years). The mean (± the standard deviation) blip frequency was 0. 09 ± 0. 11 /sample, with about one-third of patients showing no viral blips. The mean viral blip amplitude was 158 ± 132 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA copies/ml. Analysis of the blip frequency and amplitude distributions suggest that two blips less than 22 days apart have a significant chance of being part of the same episode of viremia. The data are consistent with a hypothetical model in which each episode of viremia consists of a phase of VL rise, followed by <b>two-phase</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>decay.</b> Thus, the term “viral blip” may be a misnomer, since viral replication appears to be occurring over an extended period. Neither the frequency nor the amplitude of viral blips increases with longer periods of observation, but the frequency is inversely correlated with the CD 4 +-T-cell count at the start of therapy, suggesting that host-specific factors but not treatment fatigue are determinants of blip frequency...|$|E

Thermal weed control could represent a novel method to control weeds in shrubs from container nurseries, thus avoiding {{the use of}} herbicides and mulches. The aims {{of this study were}} to develop custom-built machinery for thermal weed control in container nurseries and to test the weed control efficiency of flame weeding and steaming in Photinia x fraseri "Red Robin" containers. A liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fed flamer and a steamer with a dedicated diffuser were built. Four treatments were applied for a total period of 24 months: steaming once every four months, steaming once every two months, flame weeding once every two months or once a month. Temperature values measured at different depths in the substrate after thermal applications were recorded and analyzed. Photinia x fraseri features (height, diameter, and dry biomass) and aesthetic parameters as affected by thermal treatments were also evaluated. The trend in temperature values of the substrate over time followed a <b>two-phase</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>decay.</b> All the thermal treatments lead to a continuous near- 100 % weed control level, which is the level required by growers for aesthetic reasons. No damages caused by heat on Photinia x fraseri were observed. Container nursery producers could thus adopt thermal methods as a substitute for chemical solutions for weed control management...|$|E
