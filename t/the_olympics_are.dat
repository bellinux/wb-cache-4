5|$|Many of Canada's {{top players}} were NHL {{professional}}s, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{pushed for the}} ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> held {{in the middle of the}} NHL season. An agreement was later reached and NHL players began competing in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{voted to}} allow {{professional}} athletes {{to compete in}} Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> held {{in the middle of}} the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed to compete starting in 1998. The format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States—followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.|$|E
50|$|For {{the only}} time, {{the results of}} <b>the</b> Winter <b>Olympics</b> <b>were</b> {{included}} in <b>the</b> season standings. Future Olympic results were not included as World Cup races, nor were World Championship results after 1970. However, the inclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant to <b>the</b> final outcome, as both Killy and Greene would have won the season titles had <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>been</b> excluded.|$|R

5|$|In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, both Spanish and Catalan were {{official}} {{languages of}} the games, {{but due to}} the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in French alphabetical order. For unknown reasons, all three games taking place in Japan had the nations enter in English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, teams were ordered {{by the number of}} strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name. In the 2010 Winter Olympics, teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2014 Winter Olympics, the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Cauldron (also {{known as}} the Olympic Torch) was built for the stadium's two Olympic Games.

25|$|The 100m {{requires}} {{a high level}} of athleticism and as a result most of the participants in <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> aged between 18 and 35 – which is roughly contiguous with the period of peak physical fitness in humans. Consequently, the vast majority of participants in the Olympic 100m fall within this age range.|$|E

25|$|At {{the upper}} levels, tests for {{international}} competitions, including <b>the</b> <b>Olympics,</b> <b>are</b> issued {{under the auspices}} of the FEI. At the lower levels, and as part of dressage training each country authorizes its own set of tests. For example, in the US it is the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Dressage Federation. In Great Britain, dressage is overseen by British Dressage. Pony Clubs also produce their own tests, including basic walk/trot tests which cater for child riders.|$|E
500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{originally}} thought that for NHL {{participating in the}} 2014 Winter Olympics a deal {{would have to be}} negotiated between the NHL and NHLPA in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In January 2013, the NHL and NHLPA agreed on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. However, the decision on NHL participation at the Olympics was later announced on 19 July 2013. As part of the deal, the NHL will go on break for 17 days during the Olympics and will send 13 on-ice officials to help with the Games. NHL management was hesitant to commit to the tournament; Bettman argued the Olympic break is a [...] "strain on the players, on the schedule and on fans", adding that [...] "the benefits we get tend to be greater when <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> in North America than when they're in distant time zones." [...] According to Bettman, most of the NHL team owners agree with his position, and feel that the league does not receive enough benefits to justify the schedule break and risk of player injuries. René Fasel wants NHL participation and vowed that he would [...] "work day and night to have NHL players in Sochi".|$|E

[...] "The Chinese people {{are very proud of}} hosting the Olympics. This sense of pride transcends political views within China", says Hill. [...] "Even people who are extremely critical of their own government, and there are many Chinese who are very critical of their own government, even those people are filled with a sense of pride that China is hosting these Olympics. Many of them have taken the view that those who would somehow boycott <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> doing so out of a desire to keep China down and otherwise humiliate and embarrass China. So it is an issue with great public resonance in China, going well beyond the question of the government." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Figure Skating selects {{the athletes}} and {{officials}} {{that represent the}} United States at international figure skating competitions (Team USA). These competitions include the ISU Junior Grand Prix, Four Continents Figure Skating Championships, the ISU Grand Prix, the World Synchronized Skating Championships, the World Figure Skating Championships, and the Olympic Games. [...] Although the participants for Worlds and <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> most often the top placers at US Nationals, {{there have been several}} times when other skaters have been selected due to injuries preventing them from competing at Nationals; Nancy Kerrigan being selected for the 1994 Olympics over 2nd-place finisher Michelle Kwan is one example. [...] Most recently 2014 4th-place finisher Ashley Wagner was selected over 3rd place Mirai Nagasu ostensibly because of Wagner's more consistent international record; however because of Wagner's many endorsement contracts her selection has raised concerns about the fairness of the process (since U.S. Championships are not used as a straightforward Olympic trials).|$|E
2500|$|On 20 March 2008 Daly {{introduced}} a resolution which criticized {{the human rights}} record of China and urged officials representing San Francisco during the upcoming Olympic torch ceremonies (scheduled for 9 April 2008) to [...] "make publicly known that the 2008 Summer Games torch is received with alarm and protest." [...] Daly's resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests {{in relation to the}} Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay {{will be the first time}} in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. [...] Daly stated, [...] "he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can look you in the face and tell you <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> <b>are</b> limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that's a good poker player." [...] Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated [...] "free-speech zones" [...] stating, [...] "I don't see why we should break from our pattern of how we handle mass protests or demonstrations for China." [...] San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has [...] "very serious concerns" [...] about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is [...] "privileged" [...] to be the torch's only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time [...] "to focus on the things that unite us and not divide us." [...] In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend [...] "their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights." ...|$|E
