5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E

An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem.

Both Angle C and Angle D have measures equal to 180 − x and are congruent. Since Angle B is supplementary to both Angles C and D, either <b>of</b> these angle <b>measures</b> {{may be used}} to determine <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> Angle B.
