Grasselt (1925), an authority in the Paper Making trade, explained: The old- fashioned time-book {{has no place in}} modern industry; <b>time-recorder</b> and individual weekly In-and-Out Clock Cards are the only proficient means to obtain accurate data. Each department is to be assigned a certain [...] "block" [...] of employees' clock numbers, with sufficient allowance for additions, according to the flow of operations. Within the respective departments, each employee receives a definite clock card number, which remains with him as long as he is in a certain department or with the company. The time cards are placed in [...] "In and Out" [...] racks beside the time.|$|E

Firstly, the researcher analyzed pendulum modeling software development. Secondly, this researcher considered {{the validity of the}} software and the assessments of the whole system, and he revised the software to make it more suitable for the purposes of junior high students' pendulum modeling withcomputer simulation. Finally, the purpose of this research is to contend the suggestions of application of the software for junior high science teacher, and to develop synthetic softwareof pendulum modeling in this research. The conclusions are as follows: 1. There are six kinds of variables of simulation pendulum: mass, length, angle, force, air-force, and width of string. Based on the modeling processes, the researcher needed to develop relevant software tools to help students' modeling, such as <b>Time-recorder,</b> grid chart and the film of Galileo's history ofscience. 2. The fuzzy synthetic evaluation was implemented for assessing modeling ability. Five aspects, with totally 19 sub items together, are contained in the evaluation system, whichcan be regarded as the evaluation for student's modeling ability. 3. Via the evaluation in discipline content, media interface and the user attitude, etc., this simulation software is suitable for the stage of junior high student pendulum modeling...|$|E
