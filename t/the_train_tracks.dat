5|$|Pope John Paul II celebrated mass over <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> {{leading to}} the camp on 7 June 1979. In the decades {{following}} his visit, controversies erupted over a group of Carmelite nuns founding a convent on the site and erecting a large cross originally used in the pope's mass. Protesters objected to {{what they saw as}} Christianization of the site, while others argued that the cross's presence effectively recognized the camp's Catholic victims.|$|E
5|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the {{junction}} of Interstates 5 and 90 {{to the east and}} State Route 99 to its west. The State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> that run along the east sides of CenturyLink and Safeco Fields. An overpass for S Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the CenturyLink Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010. The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use development project replaced much of the north lot. The developer must replace the 500 lost parking spots and turn over parking revenue to the Public Stadium Authority per an agreement with King County.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E

50|$|A straightaway chute leads {{on to the}} backstretch of the Main Track {{and permits}} races on the dirt up to 1+1/8 mi long to be run with one turn. The chute used to extend further back across <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>track</b> but was {{shortened}} because a crossover is now infeasible given the clay base of the Main Track and stone-dust base of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>track.</b> Before <b>the</b> 1990 Breeders' Cup, the outer rail of the Main Track was moved back to widen {{the middle of the}} clubhouse turn and soften the angle of the start of the 1+1/4 mi Classic. <b>The</b> <b>training</b> <b>track</b> is 1 mi in circumference and abuts the east end of the main track.

5|$|Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates {{the circus}} and {{finds out that}} Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament {{in the belief that}} the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by East German guards, after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base, and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realizes that she has been tricked, and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks,</b> Delaware River and New York State Route 97 {{paralleling}} to the north, {{the highway}} begins a southeastern track.

The old alignment of State Route 237 passes a pond, as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks. The highway intersects with Township Road 413, which serves access to Hirsh Pond, located to the north. The route begins to head through larger clearings as it continues southeast. At an intersection with German Hill Road, the highway makes a shot to the east, passing through some woods. After the woods, the old alignment of State Route 237 ends at an intersection with State Route 434. This was once an intersection with State Route 137.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks,</b> with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E
50|$|The {{footpath}} {{behind the}} building is called 'The Wagon Road' because in the 1800s when the coal industry was at its peak in the North West of England, the coal wagons used {{to go down the}} wagon road to get to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>track</b> to then transport the coal into the town centre where it would be distributed to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>track</b> or <b>the</b> Whitehaven harbour, one of Britain's main ports at the time.|$|R

40|$|On {{a surface}} S, <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> {{approximate}} simple closed curves just as partial quotients of continued fraction expansions approximate rational numbers. The simple closed curve on the 4 -punctured sphere (see photograph on cover and p. 356) that, in about 1972, was {{painted on the}} wall of the UC Berkeley math department by William P. Thurston and Dennis Sullivan is approximated by <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>track</b> shown in Figure 1 (a). To visualize the approximation, blur your eyes so that parallel strands of the curve merge into branches of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>track</b> and so that diverging strands split apart at switches of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>track.</b> <b>Train</b> <b>tracks</b> were introduced by Thurston in the late 1970 s as a means of studying simple closed curves and related structures on surfaces. In general, the surface S should be of finite type—a compact, connected, oriented surface, possibly with a finite number of punctures. The simple closed curves on S that we study are those which are essential, meaning that any disc they bound has at least two punctures. Two essential simple closed curves are considered to be the same if they are isotopic on S, that is, homotopic through simple closed curves...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under {{automatic train operation}} (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a human operator as a key element. The reason that the operator is so important is because <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody would be there to stop the train if a car pulled in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.|$|E

The % Beta term standardizes avalanche runouts so that a signifi-cant data set can compare frequency and magnitude for a large number of avalanche paths in a single area. A regression analysis defines the overall frequency rela-tionship for all avalanche paths at any given location relative to the measured Beta angle. This information can be used in the design of fixed fa-cilities in runout zones to determine the likely frequency of maj or avalanche events at any location. A more refined analysis of risk levels in these locations is thus possible...|$|R
