5000|$|Upon {{the films}} August 2013 UK release, Mike McCahill of The Guardian said [...] "If David Gordon Green had made Son of Rambow, {{it might have}} looked {{something}} like this: a sunny and reasonably funny coming-of-ager"; he concluded [...] "The directors background in online shorts manifests itself in an occasional, montage-heavy scattiness, and the broadly conventional closing act cant quite maintain the laugh rate, but <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> warm-hearted and commendably daft business along the way." ...|$|E

[...] Rossen elaborated, [...] "Previous records were definitely dreamier with lots of layered vocals and weve started pairing those back and taking them away, taking them away.

5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states, [...] "Thomas gives the eight tunes fresh {{treatments}} and as usual avoids all clichés (and {{the logic of}} bop) in his explorative improvisations." [...] The Guardians John Fordham noted [...] "This one features the hard-nosed Miles Davis saxophonist Gary Thomas with a fiercely collaborative band of experts... <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> full-on tenor sax blasting over ferocious percussion barrages... The saxophonists tendency to spit out phrases rather than massage them into life gives his work a rather impassive quality that mellowed later".|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Suicide Silence, bassist Dan Kenny and drummer Alex Lopez hinted that the album would be a {{significant}} departure from the deathcore style exhibited in their previous work, stating that the self-titled record would incorporate clean vocals, these being previously uncharted territory for the band. On the usage of clean vocals, the pair commented: [...] "it’s the first time Eddie Hermida has ever been confident enough to do it, but Eddie’s always been <b>a</b> singer. <b>There’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> singing in it, <b>there’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> screaming in it, <b>there’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> everything in it… there’s melody in it.” ...|$|R

[...] <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> elements about video games to poke fun of, especially in first-person shooters, which all have {{a lot of things in}} common, such as health kits, ammo, and barrels filled with explosive material strewn about levels for no practical, real-world reason.

One {{of them was the}} religious-spiritual versus science-technology-modern-age. There are several songs on the record that, to me, address that. I dont know how other people are going to take them. Its taking off a little bit from Undertow and New Test Leper, with the freedom of E-Bow the Letter and Country Feedback - songs that just come out. What I really wanted was more of that automatic, {{unconscious}} stuff… greatly inspired by Patti Smith and various others… Bert Downs said the records about people falling down and getting back up again.

And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have - sort of give people a little break {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you dont have to absorb this information, you can just sort of - and it was more the personal side of Al Gores life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And thats when theres music." ...|$|E

Boyle strongly rebutted the Daily Mails claims, saying on Twitter: [...] "From 2007 I have paid £2.7m in tax and this equates to just under 40% of my income. <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things people do to avoid paying tax and I dont do any of them.

He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes."

5000|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrisons live shows. Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, a place where <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> wealth. It wasnt far from where I was brought up and it was a very different scene. To me it was a very mystical place. It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it a place where I could think." ...|$|E
5000|$|When I {{first came}} up with the lines, I dont know what it is, but you got to do it/ I dont know where to go but you got to be there, I was at this party for The Strokes in New York. There was this {{prevailing}} sense of, Were not quite sure whats happening or what is cool, but we know that its somewhere around here, in this room. It was this vague confusion, with everybody kind of sniffing for blood. It wasnt that it was a bad party, or that I dont like The Strokes; I just think <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> confusion right now in the music business. Then, later on, I realized the song was really personal. I didnt know where I was, and I didnt know I was actually lost. It wasnt about the party at all; its about searching but not knowing what youre searching for. Theres the train motif, being on this train heading for either oblivion or salvation - and just holding on for dear life. That song came down from some mountain somewhere, because it was right after I wrote it that I sort of packed it in.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking to Melody Makers Harvey Kubernik {{in early}} 1977, Harley commented: [...] "I feel {{on this album}} I achieve {{something}} as a singer, producer and songwriter. If it only sold three copies, I wouldnt worry. The achievement {{is more important than}} the success. This is entirely autobiographical: its the only way I can write. I did a lot of it with the running order in mind. I wrote for two months before we went into the studio and the pattern was obvious when I started writing: [...] "Seeking a Love" [...] had to open the album. <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different music styles that are confusing some people. Its taken the maturity of an older man to come out and say things in the first person. When I first started writing the album, six of the lyrics dealt with love. So I thought Id follow this with the rest of it. Its an album which dwells on the emotion we call love. I became very confident writing this album. Ive come back stronger now cause I believe in myself. I like writing all about human relationships. There is also humour in this LP: [...] "GI Valentine," [...] and [...] "Give Me More".|$|E
5000|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The albums title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the titles meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you cant put a record out without people saying its derivative of something else. So by saying the records already been heard, its kind of like saying, Yeah, youre right. Were doing something thats already been done before." [...] He reinforced, [...] "Were not trying to break new ground in music. Were {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesnt seem like were departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Indie Vision Musics Carter Fraser {{said that}} [...] "I {{apologize}} for when I suggested {{that no one}} was approaching worship from an indie rock standpoint; The Royal Royal are more or less trying. Granted, its not like theyre the next Danielson or something, but The Royalty does sound much more similar to, say, a power-pop Arcade Fire than 90% of worship music. In fact, if you were to listen to The Royalty without the lyrics, you wouldnt be able to tell its a worship album at all. Thats a terrific testament to the originality present. Sometimes the style contrasts with the plainly worshipful lyrics so much that the listener is forced to do a double take; while neither The Royal Royals style nor lyricism are unexplored, they havent been combined quite like this." [...] However, Fraser cautioned that [...] "Now dont get too excited yet, theres still much work to be done for the Ontario natives. <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> inconsistency littered throughout The Royalty but when theyre at their best, the result is striking...Theres quite simply more songwriting talent here than in other acts, yet its still undeveloped. At this point it may just be that The Royal Royal are still sort of naïve. For this reason its fair to call The Royalty a [...] "pop" [...] album when referring to its accessibility, though there are more creative undercurrents present than the term suggests.|$|E
