500|$|Written by Perry, Klas Åhlund, Max Martin, Adam Baptiste, and Caméla Leierth, [...] "Walking on Air" [...] {{discusses}} a love [...] "so {{strong that}} even heaven is jealous". Gil Kaufman from MTV {{commented on the}} song's composition: [...] "Between her wailing diva vocals, a gospel choir that kicks in during the final minute and the driving beat, Perry has captured a unique sound that both recalls the classic 1970s disco era {{as well as the}} EDM <b>thump</b> <b>of</b> today's clubs." [...] HitFix writer Melinda Newman opined that the song was [...] "redolent of '90s dance thumpers and is light as cotton candy and just as enjoyable", adding that it would [...] "make you long for C+C Music Factory". The song was also described as evoking the music of Swedish singer Robyn, an artist of whom Perry is a fan.|$|E
500|$|... "Hands All Over" [...] is a funk {{metal and}} rock song with {{a length of}} three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds (3:13). It has an instrumentation consisting of drums, guitar, piano and percussion. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote for the song, [...] "crunchy guitars and a rock star sway animate the title song". Contactmusic's Nima Baniamer stated that [...] "Hands All Over", follows a trend consisting of heavy percussions and more heavier backing vocals. Melinda Newman of HitFix wrote that the song [...] "is a heavy <b>thump</b> <b>of</b> a song that sounds pure Lange with a big kick drum propelling it forward." [...] In {{a review of the}} album, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that the track contains a [...] "rude guitar sleaze", while according to Ben Czajkowski of 411mania [...] "Hands all Over" [...] borders on anthemic rock with a biting guitar technique".|$|E
500|$|A main {{element of}} Debuts sound is its {{incorporation}} of dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London's club culture, {{with which the}} singer had established close ties. While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal <b>thump</b> <b>of</b> four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took on all these new sounds, that basic pulse was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's More to Life Than This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy". Björk felt house music was [...] "the only pop music that [...] truly modern," [...] stating in 1993 that it was [...] "the only music where anything creative is happening today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Torino Brougham models came {{standard}} {{with extra}} {{exterior and interior}} trim, finer upholsteries, wheel covers, unique emblems, extra sound insulation and [...] "Hideaway" [...] headlights. [...] "Hideaway" [...] headlights were headlight covers that were styled {{to look like the}} grille of the vehicle extended across the front end without any headlights at all. When the lights were turned on, vacuum actuators would flip the covers {{up and out of the}} way to expose the quad headlamps. [...] Motor Trend wrote that [...] "when you get into a Brougham, it's the same feeling as an LTD, or even, dare we say it, a Continental. But in a more manageable scale." [...] Motor Trend gave accolades to the 1970 Torino Brougham 2-door for its quiet interior that only allowed [...] "the muffled <b>thump</b> <b>of</b> freeway expansion-joints [...] intrude." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{reviewed}} the song saying, [...] "'California Gurls' is a fizzy-pop concoction of empty calories, {{but it sure}} does stick with you." [...] He went on {{to note that the}} craftsmanship of the song was of a high standard. Steve Leftridge of PopMatters called [...] "California Gurls" [...] the radio jam of the summer of 2010 and [...] "the gargantuan singalong fantasy that delivered on the promise built by the disco <b>thump</b> <b>of</b> hits like 'I Kissed a Girl' and 'Hot n Cold'." [...] Leftridge also praised the song's musical composition, lyrical content and its chorus which he said [...] "you know by heart halfway through your first listen." [...] The track was deemed as a highlight on Teenage Dream by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. Michael Cragg of musicOMH praised the song, [...] "First single California Gurls is brilliant, brattish fun, Perry sounding sweet and coy on the verses before that huge chorus erupts". Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that the track is [...] "an effervescent toast to summer fun." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune, however, dismissed the song as [...] "relentlessly mechanical". He went on to describe Perry's vocal performance on the song as [...] "a series of syllables digitally stitched together." [...] The single received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. On May 25, 2012, Billboard ranked the song number one on a special The 30 Summer Songs of All Time listing.|$|E
