5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to <b>the</b> <b>tumor,</b> also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach <b>the</b> <b>tumor.</b> After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E

In {{order to}} individualize and {{therefore}} have more effective treatment for pancreatic cancer, {{we have developed}} a multicolor, imageable, orthotopic mouse model for individual patients with pancreatic cancer by passaging their tumors through transgenic nude mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). <b>The</b> <b>tumors</b> acquired brightly fluorescent stroma from the transgenic host mice, which was stably associated with <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> through multiple passages. In the present study, pancreatic cancer patient tumor specimens were initially established in NOD.

5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> was inoperable, but {{he looked}} around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment of <b>the</b> <b>tumor,</b> which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure vary depending on <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> location and whether <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the reconstruction of}} bladder tumor development in individual patients spanning periods of up to 17 years. Genomic alterations detected in <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> were used for hierarchical cluster analysis of <b>tumor</b> subclones. <b>The</b> cluster analysis highlights the clonal relationship between tumors from each patient. Based on the cluster data {{we were able to}} reconstruct <b>the</b> evolution of <b>tumors</b> in a genetic tree, where tumors with few aberrations precede those with many genetic insults. The sequential order of <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> in these pedigrees differs from the chronological order in which <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> appear. Thus, a tumor with few alterations can be occult for years following removal of a more deranged derivative. Extensive genetic damage is seen to accumulate during the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>tumors.</b> To explain <b>the</b> type and extent of genetic damage in combination with the low stage and grade of these tumors, we hypothesize that in bladder cancer pathogenesis an increased rate of mitotic recombination is acquired early in the tumorigenic process...|$|R
3000|$|To {{irradiate}} <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> implanted into <b>the</b> left {{hind legs}} of mice, a device made of acrylic resin {{and capable of}} holding 12 mice was used, and the tumor-bearing mice were irradiated with a reactor neutron beam at a power of 1 MW at KUR or γ-rays after being fixed in position with adhesive tape. A lithium fluoride (LiF) thermoplastic shield was employed to avoid irradiating other body parts except implanted solid tumors. Neutron irradiation was performed using a reactor neutron beam with a cadmium ratio of 9.4. The neutron fluence was measured from the radioactivation of gold foil at both {{the front and back}} of <b>the</b> <b>tumors.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> were small and located just beneath the surface, the neutron fluence was assumed to decrease linearly from the front to back of <b>the</b> <b>tumors.</b> Thus, we used the average neutron fluence determined from the values measured at the front and back.

40|$|Thymic tumors were induced in C 3 '/Bittner mice by {{neonatal}} inoculation with polyoma virus. The {{objective of}} this study was to identify the phenotypes of the cells within <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> and to attempt to determine the origin of the neoplastic cell population(s). At the ultrastructural level, the neoplastic cells resembled normal thymic epithelium with tonofilaments and desmosomes. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated the presence of cytokeratin, Iak, -beta 2 -microglobulin, -asialo-GM 1, the thymic cortical epithelial marker ER-TR 4, and the medullary epithelial marker ER-TR 5. Islands of normal cortical thymocytes supported by residual normal cortical epithelium and acid phosphatase-positive cortical macrophages were interspersed in <b>the</b> <b>tumors.</b> Residual islands of normal medullary architecture with nonspecific esterase-positive IDCs were rarely identified in tumors. Most lymphocytes in <b>the</b> <b>tumors</b> were normal immature cortical thymocytes with the phenotype Tdt+, PNA+, Thy 1. 2 bright, Ly- 1 dull, H- 2 Kkdull, ThB+, J 11 d+, and Lyt- 2 +L 3 T 4 +.

5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E

40|$|The {{protein and}} protein-bound amino-bases in the Ehrlich and Yoshida tumor cells were cytochemically examined. And the {{influences}} of the antitumor agents, i. e.

The protein-bound SH showed the moderate reaction in cytoplasma and nucleus in both <b>tumors.</b> <b>The</b> nucleolus of <b>the</b> Ehrlich <b>tumor</b> cell showed a weak reaction, while that of <b>the</b> Yoshida <b>tumor</b> cell a remarkably positive reaction.

The protein-bound SH-SS reactions revealed almost the same localisation in both <b>tumors</b> as <b>the</b> SH reaction, but {{the intensity of the}} reaction was stronger than that of SH. And the cytochemical pattern of SH-SS caused by the antitumor agents was almost the same as SH. 3. The protein-bound SS reaction was weak in both tumor cells. Generally, SS reaction diminished by the administration of the antitumor agents, especially by MitomycinC administration to <b>the</b> Yoshida <b>tumor,</b> Nitromin and large amount of Colchicine to <b>the</b> Ehrlich <b>tumor</b> cells. Only by MitomycinC administration to <b>the</b> Ehrlich ascites <b>tumor,</b> <b>the</b> reaction of SH was increased. 4.

5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival.

Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> cells.|$|E
