5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him a sense of <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history {{was not the only}} possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>vastness</b> {{and variety}} of Canada's climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations have defined ancient peoples implicitly into {{cultural}} or linguistic divisions. Canada is surrounded north, east, and west with coastline and since the last ice age, Canada has consisted of distinct forest regions. Language contributes to {{the identity of a}} people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices. Aboriginal religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.|$|E

50|$|Their name derives, {{according}} to ancient writers, from hirpus, the Oscan for wolf; and, {{in accordance with}} this derivation, their first ancestors were supposedly guided to their new settlements by a wolf.

5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. <b>The</b> <b>vastness</b> of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, {{in as much}} as one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> of the Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, {{and the maintenance of}} a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>vastness</b> of the North American continent, and {{the variety}} of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to {{coalesce}} into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there was a}} {{systematic}} failure to appreciate the level of pre-war education in the Soviet military. The ability of the Soviets to improvise and compensate for disorganisation in logistics offset their failings. Extensive use of camouflage and all arms defence against air attack made the Soviets tenacious on the defensive. There was, on the German side, a failure to realise that the unfavourable ratio of Soviet air power to <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> of territory applied even more so to the numerically weaker Luftwaffe.|$|E

40|$|Many have {{experienced}} <b>vastness,</b> <b>the</b> feeling when the visual space seems to extend without limits away from you, {{making you feel}} like a small element within the space. For over 200 years, people have been writing about this experience, for example stating that vastness is important to the experience of awe [Mikulak 2015]. Yet vastness has received little attention in empirical research. Specifically, it is unknown which aspects of the visual stimulus contribute to perceived vastness. This {{may be due to the}} inherent difficulties in presenting a variety of vast stimuli while varying only specific visual cues. Using virtual reality addresses these difficulties, as this technology provides precise control over the presented visual stimuli. Here we investigate whether <b>the</b> feeling of <b>vastness</b> can be evoked using virtual reality and explore potential objective measures to assess vastness. We used three different measures during this experiment: 1) An avatar height adjustment task where participants had to adjust an avatar to be equivalent to their own height as viewed from a distance, 2) a distance estimation task and 3) a subjective vastness rating task. These tasks were performed in four environments: a plain (used in all subsequent environments for the ground and sky surfaces), a forest, a mountain and the mountain and forest environments combined. Our results indicate that <b>the</b> feeling of <b>vastness</b> can indeed be experienced to various degrees in virtual environments, demonstrating the potential of VR as a tool for exploring <b>the</b> perception of <b>vastness.</b> Yet <b>the</b> results combined suggest that <b>the</b> percept of <b>vastness</b> is a rather complex construct...|$|R
25|$|Contemplation is a {{very old}} and {{important}} meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichāya, one contemplates on seven facts life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichāya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichāya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. In sansathan vichāya, one thinks about <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> {{of the universe and}} the loneliness of the soul.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} problem is <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> of space. Despite piggybacking on the world's most sensitive radio telescope, Charles Stuart Bowyer said, the instrument could not detect random radio noise emanating from a civilization like ours, {{which has been}} leaking radio and TV signals for less than 100 years. For SERENDIP and most other SETI projects to detect a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization, the civilization {{would have to be}} beaming a powerful signal directly at us. It also means that Earth civilization will only be detectable within a distance of 100 light-years.|$|E

25|$|Interstellar {{travel is}} the term used for {{hypothetical}} crewed or uncrewed travel between stars or planetary systems.

Because of <b>the</b> <b>vastness</b> of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the speed of light; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.|$|E
