5|$|On August 6, 2015, Colbert (both {{in and out}} of character) {{returned}} for Jon Stewart's last night on The Daily Show, along with many other correspondents to serve under his tenure, to pay tribute to <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> host.|$|E
5|$|Some Overlords {{remain on}} Earth {{to study the}} {{children}} from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes too dangerous to remain. <b>The</b> <b>departing</b> Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end, and transmit a report of what he sees.|$|E
5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E
50|$|In Russian tradition, {{bread and}} a glass of water is put in the Icon Corner in the house of <b>the</b> <b>departed.</b> <b>The</b> bread and water are {{intended}} for <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> and other deceased ancestors who will visit to remember him. The glass is refilled with fresh water daily while water from previous day is poured out. It is common to make up the bed for <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> during <b>the</b> 40-day period, donating the bedding to poor on the 40th Day. A towel for <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> is hung next to the window and brought to the church on the 40th Day. The house doors are adorned with spruce branches for <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> to easily find his house and for the passersby to give theirrespects. On the 40th Day the branches are brought to the cemetery or burned. All remaining ritual items in memory of <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> are removed from the house, his cloth is donated to the poor or burned. All ceremonial restrictions are also lifted on the 40th Day, it is no longer prohibited to lay on <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> bed, to leave the house empty and locked, to turn off the light in <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> room, to touch <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> cloth, etc. It is also no longer prohibited to decorate <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> grave.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>departed</b> {{are also}} commemorated {{regularly}} during the Proskomedie of the Divine Liturgy. The name of <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> {{is given to}} the priest, who then removes a particle of bread from the prosphoron (loaf of bread) offered for the Liturgy. In the Russian usage, there is a separate prosphoron for <b>the</b> <b>departed,</b> from which these memorial particles are taken. After the consecration, these particles are placed in the chalice, and the church teaches that <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> benefit spiritually from this action more than any other on their behalf.|$|R
50|$|New signings goalkeeper Shay Given and winger Charles N'Zogbia {{were given}} the #1 (vacated by <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> Brad Friedel) and #10 (vacated by <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> John Carew) shirts, respectively.|$|R
5|$|Even as the {{building}} was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's neighborhood was rapidly changing; native-born Baptists were displaced by Irish and German immigrants. As members moved uptown, the congregation decided to follow and sold their building in 1860 to Alanson T. Biggs, a successful local merchant. <b>The</b> <b>departing</b> Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's interest in his work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval at an earlier date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji waving to <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> camera crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{entering}} class included 2016 Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year and Ohio Mr. Basketball Xavier Simpson. <b>The</b> <b>departing</b> class included graduating seniors Caris LeVert and Spike Albrecht {{who were}} both injured {{midway through the}} prior season. Sophomores Aubrey Dawkins, Kameron Chatman and Ricky Doyle transferred out of the program. The team also lost assistant coaches Bacari Alexander and LaVall Jordan who had both been with the team for six seasons.|$|E
25|$|People go to cemeteries to be {{with the}} souls of <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> and build private altars {{containing}} the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of <b>the</b> <b>departed.</b> <b>The</b> intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about <b>the</b> <b>departed.</b>|$|R
25|$|From the prosphoron of <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> <b>the</b> priest takes {{a larger}} {{particle}} {{as a general}} memorial of <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> hierarchs, rulers and {{the founders of the}} local church or monastery. He then takes out smaller particles in commemoration of departed Orthodox Christians. He commemorates the bishop who ordained him (if he is departed) and any of <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> whom he will, as well as the names in the diptychs and those presented by the faithful.|$|R

5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} nascent republic. The Indonesian republican government, based in Jakarta and including Sukarno as president and Mohammad Hatta as vice president, began to take over infrastructure from <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> Japanese. By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the status quo ante. The British initially focused on Java and Sumatra and attempted to avoid armed confrontations with the Republican forces; the Dutch, meanwhile, spent the first months after the Japanese surrender reclaiming the eastern islands with help from Australia.|$|E
5|$|Also in that year, Barbara Kepler {{contracted}} Hungarian spotted fever, {{then began}} having seizures. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and Padua. At the University of Tübingen in Württemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived Calvinist heresies {{in violation of}} the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return. The University of Padua—on the recommendation of <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> Galileo—sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{began the}} 1984–85 season by scoring an own {{goal in the}} first minute of his debut for Norwich against Liverpool, but went on to score the team's winning goal in the semi-final of the Football League Cup against local rivals Ipswich Town, and was named man of the match in Norwich's victory in the final. Bruce was voted Norwich City Player of the Year, but the team was relegated to the Second Division. Bruce played in every match as Norwich won {{promotion}} {{back to the top}} division at the first time of asking in the 1985–86 season, after which he was chosen to replace <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> Dave Watson as club captain. The following season he helped the club to its highest ever league finish of fifth position.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Scorsese {{released}} <b>The</b> <b>Departed,</b> his {{adaptation of}} Infernal affairs, the Taiwanese film. <b>The</b> <b>Departed</b> was also {{loosely based on}} the Whitey Bulger story, and Boston's Winter Hill Gang, which Bulger led. It earned Scorsese a best director Oscar and also won best picture.|$|R
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century {{there have}} been three large {{fundraising}} campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{took over}} the number 9 shirt from <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> James Beattie who had joined Rangers. He made his second debut for City against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 14 August 2010, he made a bright start hitting the {{crossbar}} with his first shot. However, after falling awkwardly from a challenge from Jody Craddock on 14 minutes Jones was forced to come off. On 13 September, Jones scored his first goal for Stoke on his home debut against Aston Villa in a 2–1 win. Jones followed this by scoring against West Ham United, Fulham in the League Cup and Newcastle United. He scored the second goal on 13 November in a 2–0 win against Liverpool at the Britannia Stadium.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 1930, Chairman of the Athletic Committee J. J. Doster {{announced}} that Crisp {{was to become}} Alabama's athletic director. Effective September 1, 1930, his appointment to the position was made {{as a replacement for}} <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> Wallace Wade. By 1932, his efforts as athletic director to expand athletic programs to all students at the University was recognized by Amateur Sports magazine. He remained in the position of athletic director through March 1940 when he was granted a leave of absence to regain his health due to a severe sinus issue. Frank Thomas was appointed as athletic director and retained the position upon the reinstatement Crisp from his leave in August 1940.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{lasted until}} August 10, 1974 when the players {{returned}} to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the Mackey lawsuit filed three years before. While the courts {{ruled in favor}} of the players in 1976, the union found that making progress in bargaining was more difficult to achieve. The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a refusal to deal and was therefore in violation of the Sherman Act as it deterred franchises from signing free agents. However, the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> free agent and teams still maintained a right of first refusal. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982.|$|E
5|$|To replace <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> {{principals}} the LSO recruited rising {{young players}} including Hugh Maguire, Neville Marriner and Simon Streatfeild in the string sections, Gervase de Peyer and William Waterhouse in the woodwinds, and Barry Tuckwell and Denis Wick in the brass. With the new intake the orchestra rapidly advanced in standards and status. The {{average age of}} the LSO players dropped to about 30. In 1956 the orchestra visited South Africa to play at the Johannesburg Festival. The players were impressed by the dynamic director of the festival, Ernest Fleischmann, and engaged him as general secretary of the orchestra when the post fell vacant in 1959. He was the LSO's first professional manager; all his predecessors as secretary/managing director had been orchestral players combining the duties with their orchestral playing.|$|E

5|$|Zahir's sons Uthman, Ahmad, Sa'id and Ali {{continued}} {{to put up}} resistance, with the latter putting up the longest fight from his fortress in Deir Hanna. The fortress eventually capitulated to the combined forces of Hasan Pasha and Jazzar Pasha on 22 July 1776. Ali fled, but was killed later that year in the area between Tiberias and Safad. By then, the rest of Zahir's sons had been arrested or killed. Abbas was later appointed by Sultan Selim III as the Sheikh of Safad. However, in 1799, when Napoleon invaded Palestine, but withdrew after being defeated in Acre, Abbas and Salih both left Safad with <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> French forces. This {{marked the end of}} Zaydani influence in Galilee.|$|E
5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, {{that it was}} possible to breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered the city by assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed the terms of the peace agreement. The commanders finally agreed that the peace terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, it was three days after the surrender of the city that Khalid set out after the Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Mertens had signed for fellow Eredivisie club PSV as a replacement for <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> Balázs Dzsudzsák in a dual transfer with Utrecht teammate Kevin Strootman for a combined fee of €13million. He scored on his competitive debut for the club on 7 August 2011, netting PSV's only goal in a 3–1 loss to AZ. Later that month, on 28 August, Mertens scored his first hat-trick for PSV in a 6–1 drubbing of Excelsior. Mertens' strong start to season culminated with him netting four goals in a 7–1 rout of Roda JC on 24 September 2011, meaning he had scored 11 goals in his first 7 appearances for PSV. Towards the back end of the campaign, Mertens lost a number of teeth during a collision with Heracles goalkeeper Remko Pasveer, although he managed to score during the incident. It was revealed on social media platform Twitter that Pasveer had found one of Mertens' teeth lodged in his head three weeks after the players had collided. Mertens ultimately ended the season having scored 21 goals in 33 matches, the fourth highest in the Eredivisie. He also scored three goals in four KNVB Cup matches, including a header in the final at De Kuip, Rotterdam, leading PSV to a 3–0 win over Heracles.|$|E
