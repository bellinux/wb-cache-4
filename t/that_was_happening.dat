25|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} planned to self-title their previous album, Documentaly (2011), {{due to the}} album's documentary theme. However, as {{the events of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami affecting the album's recording so much, as this did not reflect their attempt to express everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in 2011, as opposed to just what happened to the band. For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number of people would be listening to Sakanaction for the first time for this album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E
500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come {{to know more about}} them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence was the subject of intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us. We definitely talked about different versions of how <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> and different versions of ending [...] cinematically, but I think the way that it ultimately ended up is just a really well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending." ...|$|E

500|$|In response, George {{ordered the}} 1st Platoon to {{reinforce}} their ambush position. While <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> Alpha Company's right flank, which {{was covered by}} the 2nd Platoon, began to receive sporadic enemy fire. The rest of the 1st Platoon was then pinned down when the Viet Cong, from within concealed bunker positions, fired on them using captured M60 machine-guns. The Viet Cong steadily increased their fire which {{came in the form}} of various small arms, [...]50 caliber and 12.7mm machine guns. Unable to communicate with the 1st and 2nd Platoons, George moved forward with the 3rd Platoon only to find his lead platoons held in their positions by enemy fire. A M18 Claymore mine then exploded in front of Alpha Company's command element, killing the radio operator and severely wounding both George and his Forward Artillery Observer. At around 10:40am gunfire had died down, but Alpha Company was virtually destroyed during 30 minutes of fighting, with the company commander wounded and the leaders of 1st and 2nd Platoons both killed.|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account.

[...] Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, [...] "Who can forget the everlasting flavour of MSV’s expertise that emanated through each and every number, beginning with ‘Unnai Ondru Kaetpaen’!" [...] Film critic Baradwaj Rangan called it a [...] "stylish musical bonanza". According to singer Charulatha Mani, [...] "Unnai Ondru Ketpen" [...] {{was based on the}} Harikambhoji raaga and further wrote, [...] "In the phrase, ‘Ennai Pada Sonnal’, the notes SRGR,S S,N set the mood for the raga." [...] whilst also calling the song a [...] "super-hit piece". Music director and singer Ramesh Vinayakam said [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] was an example of [...] "the unconscious yet natural and healthy fusion <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> to cinema music at the hands of music directors." [...] The Hindu included [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] in its list, [...] "Immortal songs of TMS". P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language to sing a song perfectly, we need not know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Chittukkuruvi...

Be it the seductive club song Partha Nyabagam Illayo (Pudhiya Paravai)... the songs in his films were perfectly in sync with the sequence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Independent studio Media Rights Capital (MRC), {{founded by}} Mordecai Wiczyk and Asif Satchu, {{producer}} of {{films such as}} Babel, purchased the rights to House of Cards with the intention to create a series. While finishing production on his 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, David Fincher's agent showed him House of Cards, a BBC miniseries starring Ian Richardson. Fincher was interested in producing a potential series with Eric Roth. Fincher {{said that he was}} interested in doing television because of its long-form nature, adding that working in film does not allow for complex characterizations the way that television allows. [...] "I felt {{for the past ten years}} that the best writing <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> for actors was happening in television. And so I had been looking to do something that was longer form," [...] Fincher stated.|$|E
2500|$|Garcia later {{described}} his playing style as having [...] "descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> {{in the late}} Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King." [...] Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing {{had a number of}} so-called [...] "signatures". [...] Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs [...] "Good Morning Little School Girl", [...] "New Speedway Boogie", [...] "Brokedown Palace", [...] "Deal", [...] "Loser", [...] "Truckin'", [...] "That's It for the Other One", [...] "U.S. Blues", [...] "Sugaree", and [...] "Don't Ease Me In"). Another signature to his style was a poignant, almost pleading quality of musical gesture that, especially in extended solos could evolve into disparate and unpredictable emotional regions such as anxiety, anger, or triumph. This tremendous breadth of emotional expression – between songs or even within a piece – accounts for a great deal of his reputation as a guitarist.|$|E
2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning.

[...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 664, Empress Wu, {{who felt}} that her power was well established, was {{extending}} her influence further in the political arena, and when the eunuch Wang Fusheng (王伏勝) reported to Emperor Gaozong that she had engaged the sorcerer Guo Xingzhen (郭行真) – an act that was strictly forbidden—Emperor Gaozong, in anger, summoned the chancellor Shangguan Yi to consult Shangguan. [...] Shangguan suggested that he depose Empress Wu. [...] He agreed, and had Shangguan draft an edict to that effect. [...] However, Empress Wu had received information that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> and she emerged to defend herself. [...] Emperor Gaozong could not carry out the removal, and instead blamed Shangguan. [...] As both Shangguan and Wang had previously served the former crown prince Li Zhong, Empress Wu had Xu Jingzong falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of conspiring against Emperor Gaozong's life. [...] Around the new year 665, Shangguan and Wang were executed, and Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. [...] From this point on, whenever Emperor Gaozong presided over imperial meetings, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind him to hear the reports as well, and political power largely fell into her hands. [...] She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter {{referred to as the}} [...] "Two Saints." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of the MFU was defined as much by the concrete struggles and controversies it confronted as by its declared aims and goals. [...] There was, first of all, its unsuccessful quest for a much needed community center. [...] A site was found, {{but at the last}} moment the landlord, a prominent Palo Alto lawyer, reneged. [...] That led to a peaceful demonstration and a series of street concerts featuring local rock bands. [...] Not long after, the MFU was denied the right to hold one of its regular be-ins at a city park. [...] It further antagonized the already hostile city fathers and the conservative Palo Alto Times by going to court, having Palo Alto's park ordinance declared unconstitutional, and holding its Be-In as scheduled. [...] All of this occurred as opposition to Stanford's involvement in war related research was crystallizing. [...] MFU members participated in the protests and sit-ins which ultimately—after injunctions, mass arrests and trials—resulted in Stanford divesting itself of the Stanford Research Institute and eliminating ROTC. [...] While all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> the MFU—along with Kepler's Books, the local Kennedy Action Corps headquarters, the Resistance, and the home of a Palo Alto Councilmember who supported gun control—became the target of a series of firebombings, conducted by a right-wing group calling themselves the Society of Man.|$|E
