25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed <b>transmission</b> <b>case</b> which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised <b>transmission</b> <b>case.</b> These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E

Common automatic transmission modifications include built valve bodies, aftermarket torque converters, automatic transmission fluid (ATF) coolers, additional ATF filters, and aftermarket TCUs. Higher rated transmission swaps from front-wheel drive VQ or QR25DE powered cars such as the 2002–2006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec-V have also been performed.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960 Valiant {{exemplified}} Chrysler's {{leadership in}} aluminum die casting. While the aluminum Slant-6 engine block wouldn't enter production until 1961, the Kokomo, Indiana, foundry produced {{a number of}} other aluminum parts for the 1960 Valiant, all instrumental in reducing the total weight of the car. The 1960 model contained as much as [...] of aluminum in structural and decorative forms, with the majority of the material used in cast form as chassis parts.

These cast-aluminum parts were roughly 60% lighter than corresponding parts of cast iron. A cast aluminum part had the benefit of reduced section thickness where strength was not a vital consideration.

40|$|Over 90 % {{of infants}} {{infected}} with hepatitis B virus (HBV) caused by mother-to-infant transmission will evolve to carrier status, and this cannot be prevented until widespread {{administration of the}} HB vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is implemented. This prospective study of 214 infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers was carried out to determine if either perinatal or intrauterine HBV transmission could be effec-tively prevented with HBIG and the HB vaccine. Peripheral blood was collected from mothers and from newborns before they received HBIG and the HB vaccine, {{as well as at}} 0, 1, 7, 24, and 36 months after birth. Infants bornwith an ratio of signal to noise(S/N) value of> 5 for HBsAg (ABBOTT Diagnostic Kit) were defined as mother-to-infant <b>transmission</b> <b>cases,</b> those with an S/N between 5 and 50 were classified as peri-natal <b>transmission</b> <b>cases,</b> and those with an S/N> 50 were considered intrauterine <b>transmission</b> <b>cases.</b> Mother-to-infant <b>transmission</b> occurred in approximately 4. 7 % (10 / 214) of the infants; the perinatal transmission and intrauterine trans-mission rates were 3. 7 % (8 / 214) and 0. 9 % (2 / 214), respectively. The risk of mother-to-infant transmission increased along with maternal HBeAg or HBVDNA levels. After 36 months of follow-up, all perinatal cases became HBsAg-negative, whereas all intrauterine <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> evolved into carrier status.

40|$|AbstractTransmission of {{excreted}} vaccine-derived infectious {{virus from}} vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals is possible within close contacts. This randomized (1 : 1), double-blind study evaluated {{the potential for}} transmission of human rotavirus vaccine strain, HRV (Rotarix™) from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated close contacts (twins). 100 pairs of healthy twins aged 6 – 14 weeks {{at the time of}} Dose 1 of HRV vaccine/placebo were enrolled and one randomly selected twin from each pair received two vaccine doses and the other received placebo doses (at 2 and 4 months of age). Presence of vaccine strain in the stool samples of placebo recipients was an indicator of transmission. Serial stool samples were tested for rotavirus using ELISA at pre-determined time points; rotavirus positive stool samples were tested with RT-PCR and reverse hybridization assay to identify G 1 P[8] vaccine strain. If G 1 P[8] vaccine strain was detected, the complete genome was sequenced to assess the similarity between viral isolates. Immunogenicity and safety of HRV vaccine in <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> was assessed. 15 <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> were reported in 80 evaluable twins who received placebo and the transmission rate was 18. 8 % (95 % CI: 10. 9 – 29. 0 %). None of the <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> was associated with gastroenteritis symptoms. Anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion was 62. 5 % (95 % CI: 51. 0 – 73. 1 %) (HRV) and 21. 3 % (95 % CI: 12. 9 – 31. 8 %) (placebo) 7 -weeks post-Dose 2; seroconversion in <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> was 26. 7 % (95 % CI: 7. 8 – 55. 1 %). Genetic variations or amino acid substitutions in <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> were similar to that seen in corresponding vaccine recipients. Transmission of HRV vaccine strain to unvaccinated twins living in close contact occurred, however, they were not associated with increased of gastroenteritis. Whether transmission leads to indirect protection among unvaccinated individuals remains unknown at this stage...|$|R

40|$|Macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing, HIV- 1 {{variants}} predominate in the asymptomatic {{phase of}} infection {{and may be}} responsible for establishing infection in an individual exposed to the mixture of HIV- 1 variants. Here, genotypical and phenotypical characteristics of virus populations, present in sexual, parenteral, or vertical donor-recipient pairs, were studied. Sequence analysis of the V 3 domain confirmed the presence of a homogeneous virus population in recently infected individuals. Biological HIV- 1 clones were further characterized for syncytium inducing capacity on the MT 2 cell line and for macrophage tropism as defined by the appearance of proviral DNA upon inoculation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Both sexual and parenteral <b>transmission</b> <b>cases</b> revealed a selective outgrowth in the recipient of the most macrophage-tropic variant(s) present in the donor.
