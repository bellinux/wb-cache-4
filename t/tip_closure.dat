40|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} of mixed-mode delamination fracture {{in the presence}} of large bridging zones of through-thickness reinforcement are explained through an idealization of the mixed-mode bending specimen. With simple but realistic constitutive laws assumed for the bridging mechanisms, beam theory offers insightful analytical solutions and illuminates the length scales that control the crack characteristics. Of particular significance is that the mode I energy release rate can vanish after a period of crack growth, due to the bridging effect of the through-thickness reinforcement. This crack <b>tip</b> <b>closure</b> phenomenon is one manifestation of bridging-induced spatial oscillations that sometimes appears in the crack displacement function, which can be understood qualitatively through the similarity of the fracture problem to the classical problem of a beam on a Winkler foundation. The possibility of crack closure and consequent crack arrest has important consequences for designing certifying tests for laminates with through-thickness reinforcement and predicting strength and lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} (FCG) {{is a major}} cause of failure in many {{engineering}} components and structures that are subjected to dynamic loading conditions. Several models have been proposed for estimating crack growth rate da/dN under various conditions. The majority of work reported has focused on constant amplitude (CA) loading and some for variable amplitude (VA) loading. The estimation of da/dN under VA loading is complex due to effects of several factors such as plasticity, crack tip blunting, residual stresses, crack <b>tip</b> <b>closure</b> and crack tip branching which are associated with different levels of loading. These factors which cause acceleration or deceleration of the crack growth are known as interaction effects. Crack closure has been identified {{to be one of the}} main interaction factors, and finite element (FE) models have been developed to quantify it in terms of crack opening stresses. There are however still a number of issues regarding the modelling parameters such as mesh size, element type, number of loading increments and material hardening models that should be used and on whether crack closure represents the interaction effects sufficiently. Also modelling long crack lengths has been perceived to be too computationally intensive and therefore studies focus on short crack lengths only.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of crack growth under variable amplitude loading is complex due to interaction effects such as plasticity, crack tip blunting, residual stresses, crack <b>tip</b> <b>closure</b> and crack tip branching. Crack closure {{has been identified}} {{to be one of}} the main interaction effects. In order to study the effect of crack closure the authors have previously carried out experimental testing to obtain more accurate measurements of crack opening and closure;. They have also developed two dimensional plane stress Finite Element models utilising high mesh density whilst maintaining the ability to measure crack growth over long crack lengths [3]. This initial work has been extended in this paper to examine the effects of single and block overloads and random spectrum loading on crack growth. The crack length distance that is affected by overloads and underloads measured experimentally and predicted numerically are shown to be very close when using cyclic hardening material properties and kinematic hardening. In addition the comparison of experimental and numerical crack growth versus crack length graphs shows good correlation of the crack growth acceleration and retardation after the applied overload which has not been seen previously. These comparisons seem to be a very useful tool to validate numerical models...|$|E

40|$|Fracture {{modelling}} using numerical methods is well-advanced in 2 D using {{techniques such}} as the extended nite element method (XFEM). The use of meshless methods for these problems lags somewhat behind but the potential benets of no meshing (particularly in 3 D) prompt continued research into their development. In methods where the crack face is not explicitly modelled (as {{the edge of an}} element for instance) two procedures are instead used to associate the displacement jump with the crack surface: the visibility criterion and the diraction method. The visibility criterion is simple to implement and ecient to compute, especially with the help of level set coordinates. However, spurious discontinuities have been reported around crack tips using the visibility criterion, while implementing the diraction method in 3 D is much more complicated than the visibility criterion. In this paper, a tying procedure is proposed to remove the diculty with the visibility criterion so that crack <b>tip</b> <b>closure</b> can be ensured while the advantages of the visibility criterion can be preserved. The formulation is based on the use of level set coordinates and the EFGM, and is generally applicable for single or multiple crack problems in 2 D or 3 D.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sulfur on the {{corrosion}} fatigue crack growth of {{austenitic stainless steel}} was evaluated under Light Water Reactor (LWR) conditions of 288 °C deaerated (less than 5 ppb O₂) water, {{to shed light on}} the accelerating effect of the LWR environment and to explore the effect of high sulfur content on the retardation of fatigue crack growth rates. Fatigue tests were performed using a trapezoidal loading pattern with rise times of 5. 1, 51, 510, and 5100 seconds (fall time of 0. 9, 9, 90, and 900 seconds), with Kmzx of 28. 6 or 31. 9 MPa[mathematical symbol]m and stress ratios (R, Pmin/Pmax) of 0. 4 or 0. 7. Two test materials were used to evaluate the effect of sulfur: (1) a low sulfur (< 0. 0025 wt%) stainless steel and, (2) a high sulfur (0. 032 wt% stainless steel. The low sulfur stainless steel exhibited increasing crack growth rates from 9. 4 x 10 - 5 mm/cycle to 1. 2 x 1 0 -⁴ mm/cycle as rise times were increased from 5. 1 to 5100 seconds with a stress ratio of 0. 7. The high sulfur stainless steel exhibited decreasing crack growth rates from 1. 4 x 10 -⁴ mm/cycle to 7. 9 x 10 -⁵ mm/cycle as rise times were increased for a stress ratio of 0. 4, and crack growth rates from 6. 4 x 10 5 mm/cycle to 3. 6 x 10 -⁵ mm/cycle with increasing rise time at a stress ratio of 0. 7. Evaluation of the crack growth rates showed environmental enhancement of the crack growth rates for the low sulfur stainless steel, while the high sulfur stainless steel showed retardation of environmental crack growth rates, likely due to the increased corrosion at the crack tip associated with the high sulfur content. The crack surfaces were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The low sulfur material showed a light layer of corrosion product that decreased in thickness as the testing progressed, and faceting on the surface was highly crystallographic. Faceting ran both perpendicular and parallel to the crack for the short rise time steps of the test, but fewer perpendicular facets were evident at the longer rise times. The high sulfur material was heavily corroded throughout the fracture surface, and crystallographic faceting was seen for stages of the test with R= 0. 4 For R= 0. 7, the heavy oxidation on the surface made the facets hard to resolve. Striations were apparent during the 5100 second rise time for the low sulfur material (where corrosion was almost nonexistent) and throughout the entirety of the crack surface for the high sulfur material. Materials were also characterized by optical microscopy. The low sulfur material showed pitting along the grain boundaries, due to the boron concentration in this material, which resulted in boron precipitates, while the high sulfur material showed pitting throughout the surface, due to the MnS inclusions. Electrochemical tests were also performed at room temperature on both materials in pH 4 (using H₂SO₄), 7, and 10 (using NH₄OH). Peaks in the passive region of the high sulfur material were seen at potentials of 160, 630, and 1400 mVSHE, due to dissolution of the MnS inclusions. The results suggest that the high sulfur material provides an increase in corrosion when exposed to the environment, which leads to the retardation of crack growth rates at the longer rise times due to prolonged exposure of the crack tip to the environment. At low stress ratios, the proposed mechanism for retardation of crack growth rates is crack <b>tip</b> <b>closure,</b> due to a buildup of corrosion product at the fracture surface, which lowers the effective load that the crack tip experiences. At high stress ratios, the proposed mechanism for retardation is an increased in injected vacancies and enhanced creep, which disrupt the slip bands ahead of the crack tip, reducing the crack tip stresses. Fractography of the fracture surface and crack growth rate comparisons of the low and high sulfur material provide supportive evidence for the proposed mechanisms, and further work is proposed to examine the effect of increased corrosion ahead of the crack tip. by Lindsay Beth O'Brien.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that most fatigue cracks initiate from stress concentration sites found on the surfaces of components subject to cyclic fatigue loading. The introduction of residual compressive stresses into the surface layers of components, through various means including shot peening and laser shock peening, can result in local residual compressive stresses which provide a resistance to both crack initiation and propagation, thus leading {{to an increase in}} the fatigue life of the components. The effects of both laser shock peening (LSP) and conventional shot peening (SP) on the fatigue properties of both 7075 -T 6 and 7075 -T 0 aluminium round bar test specimens were investigated and compared by means of cyclic 3 -point bend fatigue testing. This investigation focused on the role that the peening induced microstructure, surface morphology and hardness had on the fatigue life of the test specimens. It was found that both the laser shock peening and shot peening processes substantially increased the fatigue lives compared to unpeened AA 7075 -T 6. The laser shock peening process more than doubled the fatigue life of the specimens and the shot peening process increased the fatigue life by approximately 1. 6 ×. No discernible hardening effects could be determined in the laser shock peened specimens. However, the shot peening process resulted in a distinct hardened region within the surface layers of the AA 7075 -T 6 specimens which was attributed to the longer pressure duration of the shot peening process which results in greater plastic deformation. It was also shown that polishing the shot peened and laser shock peened specimens after their respective peening procedures resulted in a significant increase in fatigue life. Polishing after peening resulted in a 3. 4 × fatigue life increase in the shot peened test specimens (T 6 condition) and a 5. 4 × fatigue life increase in the laser shock peened test specimens (T 6 condition). This result highlights the role that surface roughness plays in component fatigue life. Furthermore, the increase in the average fatigue life of the polished test specimens shows that the depth of the residual compressive stresses induced by the peening processes were deep enough to allow for surfaces layers to be removed from the test specimens without any detrimental effect to the overall average fatigue life of the components. The result also suggests that the magnitudes of the residual stresses induced by the laser shock peening process being greater than those of the shot peening process. The main difference between the peening treatments was demonstrated as originating from the surface roughening effects of the two peening procedures. The laser shock peening process only slightly increased the surface roughness of a polished AA 7075 -T 6 test specimens. The shot peening process severely affected the surface roughness of the test specimens, creating many potential crack initiation sites. The AA 7075 -O test specimens (annealed) showed no overall improvement in their fatigue life, regardless of the mechanical treatment received. The increased ductility of the specimens during the 3 -point bending fatigue process led to stress relieving of the peening induced compressive stresses. The specimens were however still fatigued to failure. This enabled the analysis of the effect of the peening induced surface roughness to be analysed. It was found that the shot peened and laser shock peened surface roughness values were significantly higher than the roughness values of the T 6 specimens owing to the increased ductility and thus workability of the test specimens. These increased surface roughnesses resulted in the shot peened test specimens failing before the laser shock peened specimens. Both sets of peened specimens failed before the "as machined" and polished test specimens highlighting the role that their induced surface roughnesses had on their fatigue lives. The cross-sectional microstructures of the peened samples in each material condition showed varied changes in the microstructure of the treated aluminium alloy. There was evidence of a large degree of plastic deformation near the surface of shot peened specimens in both material conditions. However, there was limited evidence of changes to the grains structure of the laser shock peened specimens, in both material conditions. In addition, the ability of the laser shock peening process to recover fatigue life in damaged components was also investigated. This brought into question whether the laser shock peening process can be used on a partially fatigued component at the point of crack initiation, in an attempt to further improve the fatigue life of the component. It was found that the laser shock peening of the cracks initiated in fatigue life recovery process did little to effectively recover fatigue life in the damaged components. A degree of life extension was present as cracks re-initiated after a few thousand cycles and was attributed to crack <b>tip</b> <b>closure.</b> This closure led to a general reduction in the fatigue crack growth rate when compared to laser shock peened/polished test specimens fatigued at the same stress...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{waves are}} {{attenuated}} as they propagate past {{the tip of}} a crack due to the reflection of the energy at the crack face and diffraction at the crack <b>tip.</b> Crack <b>closure</b> modifies the situation since partial transmission can occur at points along the crack face where asperities come in contact. This phenomenon is important in defining the ability to nondestructively detect closed cracks and in developing a more detailed understanding of the closure phenomenon itself. Modified compact tension specimens were used to investigate the effects of partial crack closure on focussed, through-transmission ultrasonic signals. Data obtained from fatigue cracks in 7075 -T 651 A 1 provides evidence for a gradual transition from a fully closed crack condition at the crack tip to an essentially fully open condition at a distance of a few mm from the tip, with additional localized contact {{along the length of the}} crack. This interpretation of the data was aided by a two-dimensional, quasi-static model for ultrasonic interaction with a partially contacting interface. The model relates width and separation of asperity contacts to the frequency dependence of the ultrasonic reflection and transmission. These measurements were supplemented by tests in which water infiltrated into the crack opening. The frequency spectra of the ultrasonic transmitted signals for this case were used to estimate the average COD at various points along the crack length...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} developing advanced characterization methods for studying the surface and subsurface damage in Li-ion battery anodes made of polycrystalline graphite and identifying the degradation mechanisms that cause loss of electrochemical capacity. Understanding microstructural aspects of the graphite electrode degradation mechanisms during charging and discharging of Li-ion batteries is of key importance in order to design durable anodes with high capacity. An in-situ system was constructed using an electrochemical cell with an observation window, a large depth-of-field digital microscope and a micro-Raman spectrometer. It was revealed that electrode damage by removal of the surface graphite fragments of 5 - 10 μm size is the most intense during the first cycle {{that led to a}} drastic capacity drop. Once a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer covered the electrode surface, the rate of graphite particle loss decreased. Yet, a gradual loss of capacity continued by the formation of interlayer cracks adjacent to SEI/graphite interfaces. Deposition of co-intercalation compounds, LiC 6, Li 2 CO 3 and Li 2 O, near the crack <b>tips</b> caused partial <b>closure</b> of propagating graphite cracks during cycling and reduced the crack growth rate. Bridging of crack faces by delaminated graphite layers also retarded crack propagation. The microstructure of the SEI layer, formed by electrochemical reduction of the ethylene carbonate based electrolyte, consisted of ∼ 5 - 20 nm sized crystalline domains (containing Li 2 CO 3, Li 2 O 2 and nano-sized graphite fragments) dispersed in an amorphous matrix. During the SEI formation, two regimes of Li-ion diffusion were identified at the electrode/electrolyte interface depending on the applied voltage scan rate (dV/dt).

40|$|Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) {{has emerged}} as an {{indispensable}} tool to probe and characterise materials, correlate local responses spatially, and manipulate and write features directly. Concurrently, nanoscale ferroelectrics have seen a surge in interest {{in the past decade}} for photovoltaic, nanoelectronics and micromechanical systems. Here, SPM techniques are used to probe electrical and material properties in a variety of nanoscale ferroelectrics. Initially, Band-Excitation Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (BE-PFM) is used to confirm the ferroelectric behaviour of synthesised nanoparticles of a multiferroic material, BiFeO 3 (BFO). PFM and other SPM techniques are also employed to measure novel properties arising at topological defects in BFO thin films. It is shown that by applying a large bias to the SPM <b>tip,</b> centre-type and <b>closure</b> domain structures can be formed in BFO. Further experiments show that by writing ring domains, and therefore curved domain walls, control over electrical properties can be obtained. Such results are discussed with respect to existing thermodynamic frameworks to explain carrier accumulation at charged interfaces to account for observed conductivity. Later, voltage-based spectroscopy is used to decipher the origins of a field-induced phase transition in mixed-phase BFO, and subsequent experiments, along with phase-field models, highlight the ability to control the transition electrically by a probe motion. This allows creation of frustrated structures, and importantly paves the way for electric field-induced control of magnetic moments. Finally, AC spectroscopic techniques are used to probe the electromechanical response of domains in Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 and BFO thin films at the single domain wall level. The results highlight the method by which motion of a strained interface contributes to the local electromechanical response, and further allows the fundamental size limits of macroscopic theories to be tested. Overall, these studies suggest that SPM and its extension to various spectroscopies can provide very detailed nanoscale insight into electrical and material properties in ferroelectrics, test long-standing macroscopic theories and their applicability in nanoscale regimes, and help evolve emerging paradigms that consider domains and topological defects as individual elements in functional nanoscale devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of an overload or underload within a {{constant amplitude loading}} fatigue test leads to a retardation or acceleration of the Fatigue Crack Growth Rate (FCGR). The understanding {{of the causes of}} these effects is essential in the context of variable amplitude fatigue loading, since in principle any loading history can be represented as a sequence of overloads and underloads. In the case of overload, along with some other minor causes, the residual stress changes at the crack <b>tip</b> and crack <b>closure</b> behind the <b>tip</b> {{can be thought of as}} the main factors that affect the fatigue crack growth rate. Whilst this has been recognised and accepted for many decades, controversy persists regarding the relative significance and presence of these two effects, and consensus is yet to emerge. The effect of crack closure, when the baseline loading ratio is high enough, can be inhibited so that the main cause of retardation becomes doubtless the residual stress present ahead the crack tip. In the present paper we report our attempt to deconvolve the contributions of crack closure and residual stress on crack retardation following an overload. To accomplish this task we analyse the results of fatigue tests run at two baseline load ratios, namely R= 0. 1 and R= 0. 7. At the load ratio of R= 0. 7 the crack closure effect is not operative, as confirmed by Digital Image Correlation analysis of the crack flanks close to the tip, and post mortem fractographic analysis of crack surfaces. Therefore, for R= 0. 7 the compressive residual stress region created by the overload ahead of the crack tip is the sole mechanism causing crack retardation. Therefore, for R= 0. 7 the focus must be placed entirely on the strain field around the crack tip. To this end, line profiles along the crack bisector of elastic strain in the crack opening direction were collected at several stages of crack propagation past the overload using in situ Synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction (SXRPD) technique. By performing comparison between the two loading conditions (R= 0. 7 and R= 0. 1), information was extracted regarding the role of residual stress alone, and then, by subtracting this effect for the R= 0. 1 sample, for crack closure alone. To enable this analysis, we propose a introducing the concept of equivalent effective stress intensity factor range, ∆Keq,eff proposed by Walker. Afterwards, the SIF range reduction ratio, β, which represents the “knock down” factor with respect to the steady state growth was assessed. It is in terms of these newly introduced parameters that the magnitude and extent of the overload-induced crack growth rate retardation can be plotted, fitted and decomposed into closure and residual stress effects, respectively. It is concluded that although the residual stress effect is present at all values of the load ratio R, its effect is relatively short-lived, whilst the closure effect that is dominant at low values of R causes longer range retardation...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with the mechanics of the initiation and growth of small fatigue cracks from notches under service load histories. Fatigue life estimates for components subjected to variable amplitude service loading are usually based on the same constant amplitude strain-life data used for constant amplitude fatigue life predictions. The resulting fatigue life estimates although they are accurate for constant amplitude fatigue, are always non conservative for variable amplitude load histories. Similarly fatigue life predictions based on small crack growth calculations for cracks growing from flaws in notches are non conservative when constant amplitude crack growth data are used. These non conservative predictions have, in both cases, been shown to be due to severe reductions in fatigue crack closure arising from large (overload or underload) cycles in a typical service load history. Smaller load cycles following a large near yield stress overload or underload cycle experience a much lower crack opening stress than that experienced by the same cycles in the reference constant amplitude fatigue tests used to produce design data. This reduced crack opening stress results in the crack remaining open for a larger fraction of the stress-strain cycle and thus an increase in the effective portion of the stress-strain cycle. The effective strain range is increased and the fatigue damage for the small cycles is greater than that calculated resulting in a non conservative fatigue life prediction. Previous work at Waterloo introduced parameters based on effective strain-life fatigue data and effective stress intensity versus crack growth rate data. Fatigue life calculations using these parameters combined with experimentally derived crack opening stress estimates give accurate fatigue life predictions for notched components subjected to variable amplitude service load histories. Information concerning steady state crack closure stresses, effective strain-life data, and effective stress intensity versus small crack growth rate data, are all obtained from relatively simple and inexpensive fatigue tests of smooth specimens in which periodic underloads are inserted into an otherwise constant amplitude load history. The data required to calibrate a variable amplitude fatigue crack closure model however, come from time consuming measurements of the return of crack closure levels for small cracks to a steady state level following an underload (large cracks for which crack closure measurements are easier to make cannot be used because at the high stress levels in notches under service loads a test specimen used would fracture). For low and moderately high hardness levels in metals crack growth and crack opening stress measurements have been made using a 900 x optical microscope for the small crack length at which a test specimen can resist the high stress levels encountered when small cracks grow from notches. For very hard metals the crack sizes may be so small that the measurements must be made using a confocal scanning laser microscope. In this case the specimen must be removed from the test machine for each measurement and the time to acquire data is only practical for an extended research project. The parameters for the crack closure model relating to steady state crack closure levels vary with material cyclic deformation resistance which in turn increases with hardness. One previous investigation found that the steady state crack opening level was lower and the recovery to a steady state crack opening stress level after an underload was more rapid for a hard than for a soft metal. This observation {{can be explained by the}} dependence of the crack tip plastic zone size that determines crack <b>tip</b> deformation and <b>closure</b> level on metal hardness and yield strength. Further information regarding this hypothesis has been obtained in this thesis by testing three different steels of varying hardness levels (6 HRC, 35 HRC, and 60 HRC) including a very hard carburized steel having a hardness level (60 HRC) for which no crack opening stress data for small cracks had yet been obtained. This thesis introduced a new test procedure for obtaining data on the return of crack opening stress to a steady state level following an underload. Smooth specimens were tested under load histories with intermittent underload cycles. The frequency of occurrence of the underloads was varied and the changes in fatigue life observed. The changes in damage per block (the block consisted of an underload cycle followed by intermittent small cycles) were used to determine the value of the closure model parameter governing the recovery of the crack opening stress to its steady state level. Concurrent tests were carried out in which the crack opening stress recovery was measured directly on crack growth specimens using optical microscope measurements. These tests on metals ranging in hardness from soft to very hard were used to assess whether the new technique would produce good data for crack opening stress changes after underloads for all hardness levels. The results were also used to correlate crack closure model parameters with mechanical properties. This together with the steady state crack opening stress, effective strain-life data and the effective intensity versus crack growth rate data obtained from smooth specimen tests devised by previous researchers provided all the data required to calibrate the two models proposed in this investigation to perform strain-life and small crack growth fatigue analysis...|$|R
