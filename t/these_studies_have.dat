5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part {{of the middle ear}} in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E

5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane {{that will result in}} flooding, in each area of the county.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E
