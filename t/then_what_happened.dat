Then there’s a journalist who kind of represents the liberal thinkers in society. All liberal thinkers have had to reassess that attitude since 9/11 because the results of free association, free movement, and free expression have put us all in danger in many ways, so everybody’s had to rethink their position.

50|$|In {{the short}} film, Vezo the 14-year-old {{daughter}} of a Vezo family, Narcia, {{tells the story of}} their survival in the style of a fable. In simple and poetic terms she describes how things were before she was born, and <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> afterwards. She begins: “Before I was born people used to say: go out with a boat and you will come back with a boat full of fish. Go to the reef and you will come back with all of the octopus you need.” She goes on to explain that when she was born villages were growing in size, families were getting bigger and there were more mouths to feed. As a result, the fish and octopus began to dwindle. Then scientists, who had heard of their plight, came to Madagascar and worked beside them. The Vezo learned how to rotate their fishing grounds, avoid hunting octopus for a season and how to plant seaweed which would not only become a crash crop for them but would supplement their livelihood, further relieving the pressure on fishing and octopus hunting.|$|E

One was he was totally unlike what I'd thought he would be. I'd thought he'd be idealistic, preachy, etc but he was interesting, very ordinary in the sense of how we used to be in college, he made mistakes, was a musician - basically very cinematic. It made me curious that if he was so 'like any of us' <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to him to make him do what he did? Secondly, also that the people fighting his case, did not know him, were not doing it for glory or money, just strangers, taking on something thousands of miles away, just because they were inspired by what he did.I thought these may be ingredients of a story worth telling." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Martlets evolved {{through this}} period, growing {{in size and}} sophistication. As Bull later put it: Martlett 2A was the first high-altitude projectile. It weighed 225 pounds.

The actual all-up weight was around 400 to 450 pounds. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> was the Martlet 2C. It was the big workhorse, still a five inch (127 mm). Then, towards the end, {{we came up with}} the 350 pound vehicle, the same thing, only seven inches in diameter.The idea was to find out what happens in the atmosphere from sunset to sunrise. Remember, nobody gave us grants. We had to produce tropical atmospheric meteorological datafor the army research office, that's how we got our money. We were trying to measure everything {{to the top of the}} atmosphere, which we labeled as a nominal two hundred kilometers.The cost of a launch was about $5,000. We did up to eight a night.

5000|$|LBT also {{accepts the}} phenomenological thesis that every mental state, {{including}} emotions, has a so-called [...] "intentional object" [...] or [...] "object of the mind." [...] That is, {{there is always}} an object to which a mental state refers or is about. Thus, if you are depressed, then you are depressed about something. This intentional object is represented in the descriptive minor premise of the emotional reasoning, for example, the premise [...] "I was divorced" [...] in the aforementioned syllogism. In addition, the syllogisms comprising emotional reasoning always rate the emotional object or some aspect of it. For example, in the aforementioned syllogism, you rate your divorce as being [...] "terrible." [...] This rating element is represented in the consequent (then clause) of the major premise of the syllogism, as in the premise [...] "If I was divorced, <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to me is so terrible that I {{might as well be}} dead." [...] Accordingly, the syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be constructed by first finding the intentional object (O) of one's emotion; and second, by finding the rating (R) of the emotion. As such, the valid, hypothetical structure of a syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be symbolized as follows: ...|$|E
