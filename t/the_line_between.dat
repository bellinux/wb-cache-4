5|$|In 1963 Richard Beeching {{published}} his report The Reshaping of British Railways, which recommended closing the network's least used stations and lines. This included the remaining former S lines except for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Darlington and Saltburn via Stockton and Middlesbrough. Passenger service between Nunthrope and Guisborough was withdrawn in 1964; the service between Middlesbrough and Nunthrope was retained. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Darlington and Barnard Castle and the branch to Middleton-in-Teesdale were closed to passengers on 30 November 1964. Trains were withdrawn north of Bishop Auckland on 8 March 1965, but the passenger service to Bishop Auckland was saved because of regional development concerns.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century German {{classical}} scholar Erwin Rohde viewed Orion as {{an example}} of the Greeks erasing <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1920s and 1930s only Britain and Japan {{retained}} battlecruisers, often modified {{and rebuilt}} from their original designs. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the battlecruiser {{and the modern}} fast battleship became blurred; indeed, the Japanese Kongōs were formally redesignated as battleships.|$|E

5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} branch line from four to eight trains per hour. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow more services to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{crossing}} loop {{was installed}} at Caringbah Station and Gymea Station when {{the line was}} opened, the single track line prevented the expansion of services to the Cronulla peninsula, and so in the 1980s {{it was decided to}} duplicate a 3.5 kilometre section of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Gymea and Caringbah, with Gymea. Miranda and Caringbah all receiving island platforms. The new section was opened on 15 July 1985. In the 2000s, the remaining single track sections were duplicated. These opened on 19 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|By 16 December, the British 5th Division had {{completed}} its move into <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed {{a period of}} hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden of the fighting was therefore assumed by V Corps as the Canadians pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.|$|E

5|$|GPK trains {{used the}} Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line {{as far as}} Paisley; it was joint with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Shields Junction and Paisley was quadrupled in 1880s. It was reduced again to double track during the mid 1960s. A third track was added once more in early 2012.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E
5|$|In Gippsland the Orbost {{line was}} {{constructed}} {{as an extension}} of suburban lines between 1877 and 1888 to Bairnsdale, and extended eastwards to Orbost in 1916. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Dandenong and Traralgon was electrified in 1954, but electrification was cut back progressively to Pakenham between 1987 and 2001. V/Line passenger trains now run as far as Bairnsdale.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it.

5|$|On 23 December 2013, a {{landslip}} at Wadhurst was {{the first}} in a series of landslips up to February 2014 which led <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Wadhurst and St. Leonards Warrior Square being closed and reopened three times, with speed restrictions in place following repairs. The train service was replaced by buses during closures. Southeastern was criticised by Hastings and Rye MP Amber Rudd over poor customer service during this period. By 12 March, the section between Wadhurst and Robertsbridge had reopened, with full service being restored on 31 March.|$|E
5|$|The Illawarra Line was {{the first}} railway {{electrified}} in New South Wales, and was built {{in conjunction with the}} construction of the City Railway between Central and St James, opening on 1 March 1926, a few months before the line was connected to the new underground railway. By November 1926 the electric overhead had passed Sutherland and continued to the branch line constructed to the Royal National Park. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Loftus and Waterfall remained unelectrified until 1980 and was serviced by steam and then diesel railcars.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Euston and Camden was doubled between 1901 and 1906. A new {{booking hall}} opened in 1914, {{constructed}} {{on part of}} the cab yard.

ACR started to clear vegetation from the line in Llangefni before Christmas 2012.

5|$|Acting on MacArthur's instructions, General Walton Walker of the Eighth Army {{started the}} Home-by-Christmas Offensive at 10 a.m. on November 24, 1950. With a reconstituted ROK II Corps {{placed on the}} Eighth Army's right flank, the advance was led by the US I Corps to the west, US IX Corps in the center, and the ROK II Corps to the east. The three UN Corps {{advanced}} cautiously in a continuous front line {{in order to prevent}} more ambushes similar to the Chinese First Phase Campaign, but the lack of manpower stretched the UN forces to the limit. Except for the strong Chinese resistances against the ROK II Corps, the Eighth Army met little opposition, and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Chongju to Yongwon was occupied {{on the night of the}} November 25.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of prestressed concrete box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E
