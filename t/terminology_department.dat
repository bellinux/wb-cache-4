Genetics and biotechnology terminology committee {{is one of the}}se teams that started his activity from 2009 and since then approved more than 500 of these terms for use in academic fields. In this research 101 questionnaires including 20 questioned term were given to more than 101 upper graduate users including MSc and PhD students and academic staff of randomly selected universities in Tehran and Semnan provinces. And then the evaluation of their acceptance was carried out by a model given by Cooper for the Study of Language Spread. All 20 studied terms were randomly selected from genetic approved terms and divided in to two groups: newly coined equivalents (those equivalents that was newly coined by the committee) and selected equivalents (those that have the selected equivalent before). Results gathered and analyzed with statistical tests, and showed that most of accepted terms are among selected equivalents. By another words the newly coined terms has much less acceptability than the others. This research introduces a method for evaluation of approved Persian equivalents of scientific terms and besides show the state of some of these equivalents between user populations. The important point is that term selection for scientific terms including genetic terms; is not an obligatory rule, but is a proposal for meeting the researchers need to strength Persian language as a scientific language. And usage of these equivalents is completely on the part of researchers and students and their point of view to equivalents...|$|E

The goal of the research is to find out the possible English accounting terminologies at Harris Hotel & Conventions, the writer felt that English language is important to be understood not just for the front office department of a hotel but also in accounting department, and the writer felt that researching about English <b>terminologies</b> in accounting <b>department</b> at a hotel is rarely done especially in Unpas. English terminologies are a set of words that related to a study or a subject while accounting department isa department that handles financial recording and reporting of a hotel, hotel is a business that provides its guests rooms for commercial purpose. In this research, the writer gathered the data with documentation research instrument, where he collected documents from Harris Hotel & Conventions Ciumbuleuit like purchase order, purchase requisition, bin card and chart of accounts, he researched and analyzed the data with qualitative method. After analyzing the research, the writer found many English accounting terminologies, there are around 66 English terminologies gotten from this research, where most of them were alphabetized and their use in accounting were explained, the terminologies were mostly related to administration, purchasing and storage operations. After doing the research, the writer suggests that English language must be considered as an essential language to be learned because it can also be appliable not to front office department but to accounting department as well, because there are many of accounting terminologies are in English, it would help the readers understand the terminologies much easier.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} student learning in two different educational delivery methods. The hypothesis tested was there was no statistically significant difference in knowledge of medical terminology between students who completed a course taught with traditional classroom instruction versus those who completed an online course of instruction. The quasi-experimental design used a pre-posttest comparison group. The participants in the study consisted of 60 students enrolled in the medical terminology classes during the summer semester of 2002. Thirty participants were self-selected from each class. Research questions were which method, if either, is the better way of instruction and should the curriculum be changed. The findings from these two questions were then made into recommendations regarding the curriculum for the program. Data analysis used frequency tables and a multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). The level of significance was set at p<. 05. A Guttman split half analysis was used to establish internal reliability of the instrument. Results of the analysis were inconclusive. There was a statistically significant difference in the pretest mean scores of the online class versus the traditional class. This could have been the result of the online class being more proficient at using the technology or could have been due to prior medical <b>terminology</b> knowledge. <b>Department</b> of Physiology and Health ScienceThesis (M.

40|$|For today's {{organizations}} to fully optimize their two major priorities;which are reducing cost and increasing revenue, {{they need to}} be involved in continuous modifications and constant renewals of right mechanism towards alignment between business and IT strategies. This paper investigates issues in strategic alignment, the specifics were: What causes time lag between business-IT strategy implementation, how can organization manage this time lag better, and finally how alignment can be achieved in business-IT strategy. Thorough literature review has been carried out, to come up with causes of time lag between business-IT strategy. Then, two case studies together with three experts' interviews have been conducted in order to validate causes of time lag in business-IT strategy. The results shows that, lack of understanding of IT departments by business department, and lack of understanding of business department by IT department and protocol rigidity are the major causes of time lag that exists between business-IT strategy. While, the lesser factors were: not using the IT departments in defining the business strategy and usage of business <b>terminologies</b> by business <b>department</b> in communicating with the IT departmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} {{of a common}} set of urban land features in a topological structure useful for a range of applications, including routine operations and decision-making, is described in this paper. This collection of non-redundant shareable data is based on an identification of administrative agencies that would use and/or manage these data. Using this information, an object-based conceptual model is developed that employs the face-and-entity concept to account for all basic land units and organizes them into different levels of hierarchy. This structuring is based on physical containment (e. g., building and pavement entities are wholly contained in the block entity, resulting in two levels of faces) and urban management rules (i. e., each face and/or its entities are uniquely managed by a certain authority). The derived conceptual model, including both the meta data and the geometry associated with the face hierarchy, is formalized with EXPRESS, an object-oriented data description language that conforms to universal and regional geographical information system (GIS) <b>terminology</b> and standards. <b>Department</b> of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R

50|$|Since 1998, Getty Information Technology Services and Web Services {{have worked}} closely with the Getty Vocabulary Program to conceive, develop, deploy, and {{continuously}} enhance the technologies necessary to support the growth and usage of the vocabulary databases. Three major projects comprise the work completed to date. First, the Vocabulary Coordination System (VCS) project created a single production system that replaced three separate, outdated and disparate data collection and editorial systems that had been used to produce the three vocabularies. The new, more powerful production engine allows Getty staff to efficiently collect, analyze, edit, merge and distribute <b>terminology</b> from Getty <b>departments,</b> as well as from external collaborating institutions. Second, the Vocabularies on the Web project produced unified Web-based access to the three Getty vocabularies and made them available to hundreds of thousands of researchers, scholars, and members of the general public who are interested in the subject areas covered by the vocabularies. This project also enhanced security to protect the Getty’s intellectual property, and added measurement metrics to allow the Getty to gauge the usage volume, usage patterns, and the success of these efforts. Finally, the Vocabulary Contributions project created processes and procedures for making use of and contributing to the vocabulary databases {{an integral part of the}} work in all relevant Getty and external projects.|$|R

Another trainee, Agnieszka Andrzejewska, wrote an assignment on her traineeship in the UnitTermCoord has an important academic cooperation with Universities all over Europe. Since 2012, TermCoord cooperates with <b>terminology</b> or language <b>departments</b> of universities on terminology projects for feeding IATE. It started as a pilot project with four universities (from Bulgaria, Belgium and Latvia) which teach terminology in the framework of a master’s course. The students work on terminology projects, following the requirements for IATE terminology work and the respective guidelines, researching and documenting terms in a main source language (English or French) and a target language of their choice (among the official languages of the EU). The results having been very positive and TermCoord is willing to cooperate with other interested university <b>departments.</b> The <b>Terminology</b> Coordination Unit also has an academic cooperation with the University of Luxembourg and the University of Mons.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the organizational aspects {{of the use of}} an electronic whiteboard system implemented in a Danish hospital located in Nykøbing Falster. The investigation or study was conducted using ethno-methodological methods and the empirical data was analyzed using qualitative analysis methods. The electronic (EW) whiteboard system had originally been developed in an ED context, but had later been extended to the entire hospital, and the study was conducted about 10 months after that time. The research question asked whether clinicians experienced impacts or consequences in the context of inter-departmental communication and coordination of work, and where there were any challenges in this respect. The results of the study shows that the EW system had been configured and use of it organized in a manner that actually facilitated support of inter-departmental communication and coordination of work. There were impacts such as inter-departmental access to patient data, inter-departmental standardization of the EW interface, the inter-departmental ordering of surgical operations via the EW system, however the study also found that there were challenges relating to the difficulty of accommodating the heterogeneous practices and <b>terminologies</b> of specialty <b>departments</b> in a standardized format. The results demonstrates the complexity of organizing cooperative work using artifacts and technology across organizational units. Finally, the study found a mixed picture with respect to the momentum of EW system use, as it would seem that there is the potential for two diametrically opposite scenarios occurring: one where EW system use intensifies and another where use becomes more subdued...|$|R
40|$|Children´s nursing has its particularities, {{whether in}} {{differences}} between child care during individual development stages {{or in the}} range of illnesses and their clinical manifestations. Nurses taking care of a child patient should observe all particularities of pediatric nursing which surely makes the nursing diagnostics diffucult and demanding. The theoretical part of the bachelors thesis Nursing diagnostics and nursing diagnoses in pediatrics" opens with a description of pediatrics alongside with an outline of history and development in pediatric nursing. The following part of the thesis describes the current state of child care. The main operating method used by nurses who take care of hospitalized children complies with the Section 4 (1) of the decree No. 424 / 2004 concerning the nursing procedure. Nursing diagnostics is one of the stages described in the nursing procedure. The following parts of the thesis include detailed accounts of the theory of nursing diagnostics, taxonomy of nursing diagnoses, and particularities of the nursing diagnoses in pediatrics. The survey was based on quantitative method by way of questinnaires. Also, the data content analysis was utilized in order to complete the data acquired. The aim of the bachelors thesis was to find out whether the nurses addressed knew the nursing diagnoses used in pediatrics, if they use such diagnoses in practice, and what is the biggest obstacle when performing nursing diagnostics in pediatrics. The outcome from the data collected proves all three hypotheses correct. Hypothesis 1 is: Nurses have a good command of nursing diagnostics in pediatrics. Hypothesis 2 is: Nurses utilize individually the nursing diagnoses in pediatrics. Hypothesis 3 is: Lack of time is considered to be the biggest obstacle while using the nursing diagnostics in pediatrics by nurses. The survey has also found out that there are utilized different taxonomies for nursing diagnoses with respect to differences at various age and other particularities, which certainly respects the child as an individual human being but makes the diagnostics more time demanding. Therefore it is suggested to unify the used <b>terminology</b> within individual <b>departments</b> with respect to a number of published books on nursing diagnostics in pediatrics and make otherwise time demanding nursing work a little easier...|$|R
