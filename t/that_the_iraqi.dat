5|$|Armored and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army had amassed around 60,000 troops {{across the}} border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, {{in as many}} as 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets saw {{combat in}} several roles during the Iraq War. Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 20 March, No.75 Squadron was initially used to escort high-value Coalition aircraft, such as tankers and airborne early warning and control aircraft. As it rapidly became clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force posed no threat, from 21 March No.75 Squadron also began to also conduct air interdiction sorties against Iraqi forces. These sorties were initially flown {{in support of the}} United States Army's V Corps, but the squadron was rarely assigned any targets to attack. As a result, the Australian commanders in the Middle East had No.75 Squadron reassigned to support the United States Marine Corps' I Marine Expeditionary Force. At this time the squadron also began flying close air support sorties. During {{the first two weeks of}} the war the squadron typically flew 12 sorties per day. To avoid pilot fatigue, additional aircrew were posted to the Middle East from Australia. The number of sorties dropped to between six and ten per day from 5 April onwards as the American forces closed on Baghdad and few targets remained in southern Iraq. On 12 April, No.75 Squadron supported elements of the Special Air Service Regiment and 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which occupied Al Asad Airbase. During the last weeks of the war the squadron continued to fly sorties across western, central and southern Iraq to support British and American forces. In several of the squadron's operations in the final week of the war, the Hornets made low altitude and high speed passes over Iraqi positions to encourage their defenders to surrender. No.75 Squadron conducted its final combat sorties on 27 April. During the war the squadron flew 350 combat missions (including 670 individual sorties) and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs. No.75 Squadron did not suffer any casualties, and all 14 Hornets returned to Tindal on 14 May 2003.|$|E

50|$|UN Chief Inspector Hans Blix, on 14 February 2003, {{presented}} {{a report to}} the Security Council. Blix gave an update of the situation in Iraq, and he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> were now more proactive in their cooperation. He also rebutted some of the arguments proposed by Powell. Blix questioned the interpretations of the satellite images put forward by Powell, and stated that alternate interpretations of the satellite images were credible. He also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> have in fact never received early warning of the inspectors visiting any sites (an allegation made by Powell during his presentation). International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohammed ElBaradei also said that he did not believe <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> have a nuclear weapons program, unlike what Powell had claimed.|$|R

25|$|In 2002, the United States {{government}} began {{to argue for}} the necessity of invading Iraq. This formally began with a speech by U.S President George W.

25|$|On January 22, Iraqi forces fully {{entered the}} Sajjariyah District, {{and they also}} entered the ISIL-held areas in the Joabah and Husaiyah Districts, {{to the east of}} Ramadi. On January 23, ISIL {{launched}} suicide attacks in the Kilo 70 area west of Ramadi, and in the Tal Msheheidah east of Ramadi, as well as areas to the north of Ramadi; the ensuing clashes and airstrikes led to the deaths of 62 ISIL militants and 48 Iraqi fighters. On January 24, Iraqi Defense Minister said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army was preparing for an offensive on Mosul, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army and Coalition forces had defeated ISIL in Ramadi. Later on the same day, 190 people suspected of collaborating with ISIL were arrested in Ramadi, even as fighting shifted to the Husaiybah District, to the east of Ramadi. On January 26, the Iraqi Army found and destroyed the ISIL headquarters in eastern Ramadi, in the al-Sofiyah District, killing at least 6 ISIL militants.|$|E
25|$|The book's second {{central theme}} {{revolves}} around {{the connection between the}} Arab-Jews and the Palestinians.

50|$|Iraqis {{thought that}} Coalition forces were {{prepping}} the Wadi Al-Batin {{for the main}} attack.
