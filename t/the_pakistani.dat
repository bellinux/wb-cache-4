Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|Al-Balawi was a Jordanian {{doctor and}} {{jihadist}} website writer who was detained and interrogated over three days by the Jordanian intelligence service, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), in January 2009. The GID and the CIA {{thought they had}} turned al-Balawi to penetrate al-Qaeda in <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> tribal areas to provide intelligence for high-level targets. Instead, al-Balawi used this trust {{to gain access to}} the CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack. <b>The</b> <b>Pakistani</b> Taliban and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility, saying they helped al-Balawi with the attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> Navy and almost the entire Pakistan Naval fleet was based at Karachi Harbour. It is also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, meaning that a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes, including cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area.|$|E

50|$|Major Suraj Singh {{calls out}} to the Indians, {{but he has been}} a {{prisoner}} for six years. As he calls for help, his voice stammers and fails many times. The Indians simply do not or cannot hear him. Then suddenly gunshots are heard and Suraj collapses. A column of Pakistani soldiers is running towards the two fugitives. Suraj is shot badly. The Indian soldiers rush to their defensive positions. As Gurtu is still recovering from the shock, Suraj struggles to his feet. He tells Gurtu that he will be back with help even before <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> arrive. He is still the father figure his men loved him for being. <b>The</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> are rushing on, screaming obscenities. Suraj runs towards the Indian outpost. As <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> fire at him, the Indians, thinking that a skirmish is on, fire back at <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis.</b> This pins them down considerably so their firing on Suraj does not have much effect. Then the Indian officer sees Suraj through his binoculars and orders his men to stop firing as he realizes that <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> were chasing a fugitive. Then <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> are able to come out into the open and fire at Suraj. He nevertheless runs as hard as he can. There is an explosion close to his feet, probably a land mine, and he is thrown forward to the ground by the force of the blast.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the NATO attacks, <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> {{government}} refused to attend the Bonn conference scheduled on 5 December 2011. The event in Bonn, Germany is an important international conference on Afghanistan. International pressure over Pakistan amounted as it refused to attend the Bonn conference. Secretary Hillary Clinton contacted <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> Prime Minister but her plea was rejected because Pakistani public opinion prohibited attendance. The conference was generally regarded as a disappointment, partially because of Pakistan's absence.|$|E

The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> president.
