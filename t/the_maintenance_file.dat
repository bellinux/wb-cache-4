It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions (fragments). It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation. Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together, as they are often accessed in sequence.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an integrated set-theoretic data model {{that offers a}} framework for defining a unified schema for any database environment. We utilise the concepts ”entity ” in its classical meaning, ”tag ” {{as a set of}} properties (attributes) which can describe an entity, ”subtag ” as a set of simple atomic attributes which cannot be decomposed further, ”domain ” as a set of well-defined values that can be derived from pre-specified data types, ”language”, ”vocabulary ” and ”message ” as strings or coded values that represent human languages and corresponding messages. The model described can manage efficiently changes that occur at the logical level and supports operations and functions that offer solutions to well-known problems faced by database designers and programmers alike.

To preserve the mental map, {{changes to the}} drawing should be minimized after each update, and Binucci et al. show that exponential area is necessary and sufficient {{for a number of}} streamed graph drawings for trees if edges are not allowed to move at all.

The model demonstrates that the two prices exert negative effects on renewal and patenting, respectively (i. e. adverse own price effects). The model also offers a discriminating testable hypothesis, predicted on the cross-price effects, to identify complementarity or substitutability across sequential innovations. Our regression results show that the probability of patent renewal and maintenance fees are correlated negatively and that the patent propensity and application fees are correlated negatively. We also demonstrate that higher application fees are associated with lower probability of patent renewal, which corroborates the case of complementarity in sequential innovations.

All previous work on this problem (both upper and lower bounds) only applied to deterministic algorithms, {{so this is the}} first paper addressing the (im) possibility of faster randomized algorithms. Our lower bound Ω(n log(n)) matches {{the complexity of}} a known deterministic algorithm for this setting of parameters so it is asymptotically optimal.

40|$|CMS {{currently}} uses {{a number}} of tools to transfer data which, taken together, {{form the basis of}} a heterogeneous datagrid. The range of tools used, and the directed, rather than optimized nature of CMS recent large scale data challenge required the creation of a simple infrastructure that allowed a range of tools to operate in a complementary way. The system created comprises a hierarchy of simple processes (named ‘agents’) that propagate files through {{a number of}} transfer states. File locations and some application metadata were stored in POOL file catalogues, with LCG LRC or MySQL back-ends. Agents were assigned limited responsibilities, and were restricted to communicating state in a well-defined, indirect fashion through a central transfer management database. In this way, the task of distributing data was easily divided between different groups for implementation. The prototype system was developed rapidly, and achieved the required sustained transfer rate of ~ 10 MBps, with O(106) files distributed to 6 sites from CERN. Experience with the system during the data challenge raised issues with underlying technology (MSS write/read, stability of <b>the</b> LRC, <b>maintenance</b> of <b>file</b> catalogues, synchronization of filespaces), all of which have been successfully identified and handled. The development of this prototype infrastructure allows us to plan the evolution of backbone CMS data distribution from a simple hierarchy to a more autonomous, scalable model drawing on emerging agent and grid technology.

40|$|Last lecture we {{discussed}} the cache-oblivious model for algorithm and data structure design, and surveyed current results within this model. During this survey, we developed {{the idea of a}} cacheoblivious dynamic B-tree. In order to construct this data structure, we utilized a black box component data structure that could maintain an array of N elements in order in O(N) space and achieve insert/delete operations in O(lg 2 N) (O (lg 2 N B) memory transfers in the cache-oblivious model). This problem is called Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> in <b>the</b> literature, and is the topic {{of the first half of}} this lecture. In the second half of this lecture, we complete our survey of cache-oblivious algorithms by investigating cache-oblivious priority queues. 2 Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> [1] [2] Formally <b>the</b> Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> problem is to maintain an array of N elements in O(N) space by having only O(1) size empty array-slot “gaps ” between elements. This leads to scanning any k items in O(⌈k/B⌉) memory transfers and performing updates (insert/delete) in lg 2 N B memory transfers by rearranging only O(lg 2 N) amortized consecutive elements. Because both scanning and updates involve only consecutive elements, and therefore the 1 B factor in the number of memory transfers is obvious, we will continue in our investigation considering only the traditional data structure without any caching. The rough idea of the OFM data structure is as follows: on any update of an element e, choose progressively larger intervals of the array that contains e until the element density of the interval is “within threshold”, then evenly redistribute all elements in the interval. We choose intervals from our array using a symbolic complete binary search tree. We divide our array into segments of Θ(lg N) elements each, and use these as the leaves of our symbolic BST. When an update occurs, we walk up our tree until the segment of the array covered by the current subtree is within our density threshold. We define our desity threshold on a node at depth d in a tree of height h as follows: density ≥ 1 2 density ≤...|$|R
