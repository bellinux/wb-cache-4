40|$|Grain yield {{variations}} in bread wheat and <b>two-row</b> <b>barley</b> are better explained {{by changes in}} grain number (GN) than mean grain weight. However, the strategies for building GN are different in both species because in <b>two-row</b> <b>barley</b> the {{variations in}} GN are more frequently related {{to the number of}} spikes m− 2, due to its higher tillering capacity than wheat, whereas in bread wheat both grain number spike− 1 and the number of spikes m− 2 contribute to the establishment of GN. The higher tillering capacity and leaf area index {{at the beginning of the}} crop cycle in <b>two-row</b> <b>barley</b> allows a higher radiation accumulation than in bread wheat. We hypothesize that the higher early vigor of <b>two-row</b> <b>barley,</b> associated with its greater leaf area exposure relative to wheat, represents an initial advantage that is capitalized at the end of the cycle as higher biomass accumulation driven by a larger GN and consequently higher grain yield. The main objective of this work was to compare different physiological traits of bread wheat and <b>two-row</b> <b>barley</b> growing together under different temperature and radiation conditions. We evaluated two genotypes of each species, with similar phenology, growing under four different environments without water or nutritional deficiencies. Numerical yield components, biomass, radiation interception and harvest index were measured. Despite no differences being observed between genotypes of bread wheat and <b>two-row</b> <b>barley</b> in terms of total grain yield and total grain number when exposed to different environments, each species had a different strategy for establishing the final yield. Although <b>two-row</b> <b>barley</b> showed initial advantages in radiation interception, bread wheat genotypes accumulated more intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (iPAR) and used it in a more efficient way than <b>two-row</b> <b>barley,</b> thus allowing a higher biomass accumulation. Both species showed a reduction in grain weight due to increases in mean night and high temperatures. Grain weight reductions were higher in bread wheat than in <b>two-row</b> <b>barley,</b> and were directly associated with shortening of the duration of grain filling without consequences for the grain-filling rate. This suggested a direct effect of temperature on grain development rather than a growth limitation due to a lack of source...|$|R

40|$|Rph 20 is {{the only}} reported, simply {{inherited}} gene conferring moderate {{to high levels of}} adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia hordei Otth) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Key parental genotypes were examined to determine the origin of Rph 20 in <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley.</b> The Dutch cultivar 'Vada' (released in the 1950 s) and parents, 'Hordeum laevigatum' and 'Gull' ('Gold'), along with the related cultivar 'Emir' (a derivative of 'Delta'), were assessed for APR to P. hordei in a disease screening nursery. The marker bPb- 0837 -PCR, co-located with Rph 20 on the short arm of chromosome 5 H (5 HS), was used to screen genotypes for the resistance allele, Rph 20. ai.

40|$|Increased seed {{production}} {{has been a}} common goal during the domestication of cereal crops, and early cultivators of barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) selected a phenotype with a six-rowed spike that stably produced three times the usual grain number. This improved yield established barley as a founder crop for the Near Eastern Neolithic civilization. The barley spike has one central and two lateral spikelets at each rachis node. The wild-type progenitor (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) has a two-rowed phenotype, with additional, strictly rudimentary, lateral rows; this natural adaptation is advantageous for seed dispersal after shattering. Until recently, {{the origin of the}} six-rowed phenotype remained unknown. In the present study, we isolated vrs 1 (six-rowed spike 1), the gene responsible for the six-rowed spike in barley, by means of positional cloning. The wild-type Vrs 1 allele (for <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley)</b> encodes a transcription factor that includes a homeodomain with a closely linked leucine zipper motif. Expression of Vrs 1 was strictly localized in the lateral-spikelet primordia of immature spikes, suggesting that the VRS 1 protein suppresses development of the lateral rows. Loss of function of Vrs 1 resulted in complete conversion of the rudimentary lateral spikelets in <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley</b> into fully developed fertile spikelets in the six-rowed phenotype.
