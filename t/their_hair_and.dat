5|$|In ancient China and Korea, {{hair was}} {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. Most people would never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|The male {{actors were}} asked to grow <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> moustaches. The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters. The costumes had a faded look, a {{reflection}} that people of the period owned few clothes, often only two outfits. None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before {{of what they were}} to do in their daily scenes. The Romani were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie, and were only told that the story was set in hard times comparable to Ceaușescu's tenure in Romania. In the scene where the Romani revolt against the police over the death of Taloche, they were made aware of the character's death only when the scene was being shot, leading to a genuine outpouring of emotions, making their fight with the police appear more real. Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt by the Romani in Auschwitz on May 16, 1944.|$|E
50|$|Young women grew <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long <b>and</b> did {{not cover}} it, but married {{women were not}} allowed to wear <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long, <b>and</b> covered <b>their</b> heads with veils.|$|R
5000|$|While {{married women}} in Hanakia wore plain clothes <b>and</b> hid <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> under bonnets <b>and</b> headdresses even {{from their own}} husbands, their men wore <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long <b>and</b> even <b>their</b> clothes were flauntingly {{colorful}} and decorated.|$|R
50|$|Men on Seggri wear <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> ornamentally long <b>and</b> dress ostentatiously (tailoring {{is one of}} the few male crafts on Seggri). In contrast, women crop <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> short <b>and</b> {{dress in}} a fashion {{considered}} drab by offworlders.|$|R
25|$|Post-pubescent {{women are}} {{required}} to cover <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> body in Iran and can be arrested for failing to do so.|$|E
25|$|Widows and widowers {{observed}} {{three days}} of fasting and silence, wherein they did not bathe or comb <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> may even shave <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyebrows as a special sign of grief. They abstained from eating cooked food until the mourning period ended. In {{the case of the}} death of a datu, his wives, or children: the community was placed under strict mourning requirement called the pumaraw where no one was to wear colored clothes, climb coconut trees, or fish in certain streams; and spears were to be carried point down and side arms blade up. A mournful silence was to be conserved, and families could be enslaved as punishment for breaking the mourning interdict.|$|E
25|$|The middle 19th century saw {{continued}} official {{harassment of}} the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw {{to retain the}} right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.|$|E
50|$|Some people shave <b>their</b> Sheepdog's <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> spin it into yarn.|$|R
50|$|Dalaketnons {{were known}} to be rather {{beautiful}} elitists. They have a bit of a coño, a kind of telekinesis as well as corporeal duplication—meaning they could generate tangible, living copies of themselves indefinitely, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> eyes turn white whenever their power manifests.|$|R
5000|$|That it is {{permissible}} for unmarried women to leave <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> loose <b>and</b> untied.|$|R
25|$|These {{changes in}} media engendered the {{paintings}} that Degas would produce in later life. Degas began to draw and paint women drying themselves with towels, combing <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> bathing (see: After the Bath, Woman drying herself). The strokes that model the form are scribbled more freely than before; backgrounds are simplified.|$|E
25|$|Ranjit Singh banned cow {{slaughter}} in his empire. He {{objected to}} cow slaughter inside the British camp during joint operations in northwestern region of South Asia. In employment contracts {{he gave to}} foreigners such as the Europeans, he insisted {{that they do not}} eat beef, not smoke, not cut <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> asked them to marry and settle down with Indian women.|$|E
25|$|The primary deity {{presiding}} over the delivery was Juno Lucina, who {{may in fact be}} a form of Diana. Those invoking her aid let their hair down and loosened their clothing as a form of reverse binding ritual intended to facilitate labor. Soranus advised women about to give birth to unbind <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> loosen clothing to promote relaxation, not for any magical effect.|$|E
50|$|Yelang people wore <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> up <b>and</b> {{decorated}} {{themselves with}} jewellery such as bracelets and necklaces.|$|R

50|$|During that time, Pailin's {{economy grew}} and the {{livelihood}} of the Kula people grew with it. In the 1960s, Pailin became a tourist destination, jolting the Kula people into modern day, forcing their culture to change. For example, Kula traditionally kept <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long <b>and</b> braided, {{and the men}} wore sarongs but with increased knowledge of the outside world, many Kula cut <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> cut <b>and</b> started wearing trousers.|$|R
25|$|Kunle Afolayan like in his {{previous}} films featured in October 1 as a farmer with the name Agbekoya. For his role, {{he had to leave}} his hair for sometime in order to let it just grow. He also stated in an interview with Toni Kan and Peju Akande on Africa Magic that some other actors were also asked to leave <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> beard for about a year for the film.|$|E
25|$|He {{follows the}} {{experiences}} of doctors who had emerged from the rubble of their hospitals only to find themselves with little of the medical equipment and supplies that were so desperately needed. Some patients who had initially appeared to have survived the bomb without a scratch suffered no ill effects {{for a few days}} and then suddenly started vomiting, losing <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> bleeding to death {{as a result of the}} effects of the then-unknown condition of radiation poisoning.|$|E
25|$|The band sent several demos {{to record}} companies, but {{were told that}} in order to be {{published}} they had to cut <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> sing in Swedish. Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by John Levén. Just a couple of months later, Levén joined Yngwie Malmsteen's band Rising Force, and Malmsteen's former bassist, Marcel Jacob, joined Force. This only lasted for three months, though; Levén apparently had issues with Malmsteen, so he and Jacob traded places again.|$|E

50|$|Cats use postures and {{movement}} to communicate {{a wide range}} of information. There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression. Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.|$|R
50|$|As the 1930s approached, women {{started to}} grow <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> longer, <b>and</b> the sharp {{lines of the}} bob were abandoned.|$|R
25|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia {{requires}} Muslim {{women to}} cover <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> all {{women have to}} wear a full-body garment. Saudi women commonly wear the traditional abaya robe, while foreigners sometimes opt for a long coat. These regulations are enforced by the religious police and vigilantes. In 2002 the Saudi religious police were accused by Saudi and international press of hindering the rescue of schoolgirls from a fire because they were not wearing hijab, which resulted in 15 deaths.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of Friday, December 30, 2005 police raided the camp and clashes ensued in the {{presence}} of TV cameras and the press. They dragged the refugees across the street, pulled women from <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> pushed the elderly carrying newborn babies. Refugees were put in public transit busses to be transferred to central security force camps in different locations in Egypt in addition to taking some of them to State security intelligence offices. Many of those taken to the camps suffered fractures and injuries and lack any medical help.|$|E
25|$|Another sixteen-year-old student, Veronica Capodieci, {{was seriously}} wounded with grave chest and {{abdominal}} injuries. Four other students, including the older sister of Veronica, were injured and badly burned; one girl risked losing both legs. Fellow students immediately rushed {{to help the}} victims before the ambulances and police arrived. The injured students {{lay on the ground}} with <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> clothing burnt, the school wall near the blast's epicentre showed extensive scorching, and the street was littered with books, papers and knapsacks. Glass from shattered windows also covered the pavement.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, {{many men}} wore <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long <b>and</b> in ponytails. This look was popularized by 1970s-era rock musicians.|$|R

5000|$|The {{males were}} called Bodgies and the females were called Widgies. Bodgies were often {{depicted}} in Australian media and folk-lore as louts. On 1 February 1951 the Sydney Morning Herald wrote on its front page:What with [...] "bodgies" [...] growing <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long <b>and</b> getting around in satin shirts, and [...] "wedgies" [...] cutting <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> short <b>and</b> wearing jeans, confusion {{seems to be}} arising about the sex of some Australian adolescents..|$|R
25|$|Flower {{power was}} a slogan {{used during the}} late 1960s and early 1970s {{as a symbol of}} passive {{resistance}} and non-violence ideology. It is rooted in the opposition movement to the Vietnam War. The expression was coined by the American beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1965 as a means to transform war protests into peaceful affirmative spectacles. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children. The term later became generalized as a modern reference to the hippie movement and the so-called counterculture of drugs, psychedelic music, psychedelic art and social permissiveness.|$|E
25|$|Africans {{captured}} {{as slaves}} {{no longer had}} the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. Slaves adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece carding tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and infestations due to their deplorable living conditions. Slaves used varying remedies for disinfecting and cleansing their scalps, such as applying kerosene or cornmeal directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. For field work, male slaves shaved <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. House slaves had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore wigs mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or braided their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as lard, butter and goose grease, were used to moisturize the hair. Female slaves sometimes used hot butterknives to curl their hair.|$|E
25|$|Women {{invariably}} grew {{their hair}} long and, {{as in other}} European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person {{could be forced to}} pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.|$|E
5000|$|... "people of {{the nation}} wore <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> loose <b>and</b> very long and were covered in cloaks made of sable skins..." [...] (Cabeza de Vaca 35).|$|R
50|$|Christian men are to wear <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> short <b>and</b> Christian {{women must}} never cut or remove <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> wearing it long {{in order to}} have a {{definitive}} distinction of male and female sexes.(1 Cor. 11:14-15).|$|R
50|$|Men's hair fashion favoured the wet look, {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} products such as Brylcreem. Young men often grew <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> out <b>and,</b> with pomade or other <b>hair</b> treatments, coiffed <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> into pompadours.|$|R
