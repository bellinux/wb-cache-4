5|$|At one time, stable carbenes {{were thought}} to {{reversibly}} dimerise through the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are <b>thermodynamically</b> stable and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so <b>thermodynamically</b> stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|However, these carbenes are not <b>thermodynamically</b> stable as {{decomposition}} and dimerisation {{have been}} observed for unhindered examples.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different <b>thermodynamically</b> stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying <b>thermodynamically</b> stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|Properties {{noted in}} this section refer to the {{elements}} in their most <b>thermodynamically</b> stable forms under ambient conditions.|$|E
5|$|Imidazole-based carbenes are <b>thermodynamically</b> {{stable and}} {{generally}} have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–230 ppm for the carbenic carbon. Typically, X-ray structures of these molecules show N-C-N bond angles of 101–102°.|$|E
5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly {{reactive metals}} (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) and highly electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by electron transfer, a process <b>thermodynamically</b> understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E
5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} {{relies on}} the law of mass action, which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and <b>thermodynamically</b> driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E
5|$|Under high {{pressures}} helium {{can form}} compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown {{at room temperature}} at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. The insulating electride Na2He {{has been shown to}} be <b>thermodynamically</b> stable at pressures above 113 GPa. It has a fluorite structure.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{aromatic}} imidazol-2-ylidenes or triazol-5-ylidenes, these carbenes appear {{not to be}} <b>thermodynamically</b> stable, {{as shown}} by the dimerisation of some unhindered cyclic and acyclic examples. Studies suggest that these carbenes dimerise via acid catalysed dimerisation (as in the Wanzlick equilibrium).|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are <b>thermodynamically</b> unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are <b>thermodynamically</b> stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E
5|$|The two {{components}} of the proton-motive force are <b>thermodynamically</b> equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy {{is provided by the}} potential; in alkaliphile bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, chloroplasts operate mainly on ΔpH. However, they also require a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the fusobacterium Propionigenium modestum it drives the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one <b>thermodynamically</b> stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is <b>thermodynamically</b> a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most <b>thermodynamically</b> stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most <b>thermodynamically</b> stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} {{composed}} of seven subunits: Arp2, Arp3, p41/ARPC1, p34/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p20/ARPC4, p16/ARPC5. The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a <b>thermodynamically</b> stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts with the mother filament {{and there is a}} major loss of nucleation efficiency in the absence of p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction with the mother filament. p21 forms a bridge between Arp3 and the mother filament, increasing nucleation efficiency. p16 tethers Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are <b>thermodynamically</b> open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E
5|$|The polyatomic {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished from}} the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers, higher melting points (in their <b>thermodynamically</b> most stable forms), and higher boiling points; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility. More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms, and a stronger inclination to catenate; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ability of carbon to catenate, in particular, is fundamental {{to the field of}} organic chemistry and life on Earth. All of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids, and all are known in either malleable, pliable or ductile forms; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities than those of the diatomic nonmetals.|$|E
5|$|Triazole-based carbenes are <b>thermodynamically</b> {{stable and}} have {{diagnostic}} 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–220 ppm for the carbenic carbon. The X-ray {{structure of the}} triphenyl substituted carbene above shows an N-C-N bond angle of ca. 101°. The 5-methoxytriazole precursor to this carbene {{was made by the}} treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium methoxide, which attacks as a nucleophile. This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity.|$|E
5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being <b>thermodynamically</b> unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E
5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more <b>thermodynamically</b> stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more <b>thermodynamically</b> stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to couple a <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable reaction (a transition from a high-energy state to a lower-energy state) to a <b>thermodynamically</b> unfavorable reaction (such as a separation of charges, or {{the creation of an}} osmotic gradient), {{in such a way that}} the overall free energy of the system decreases (making it <b>thermodynamically</b> possible), while useful work is done at the same time. The principle that biological macromolecules catalyze a <b>thermodynamically</b> unfavorable reaction if and only if a <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable reaction occurs simultaneously, underlies all known forms of life.|$|E
25|$|Reaction 1 is {{discarded}} {{as it has}} {{the most}} negative value on standard reduction potential thus making it less <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable in the process.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{functionalization}} of {{a primary}} alkane bond {{is due to the}} formation of a kinetically and <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable primary alkyl-metal complex over formation of a secondary alkyl-metal complex.|$|E
25|$|Under {{standard}} {{conditions it is}} more stable than white phosphorus, but less stable than the <b>thermodynamically</b> stable black phosphorus. The standard enthalpy of formation of red phosphorus is -17.6 kJ/mol.|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin {{exhibits}} atropisomerism — it {{has multiple}} chemically distinct rotamers {{owing to the}} rotational restriction {{of some of the}} bonds. The form present in the drug is the <b>thermodynamically</b> more stable conformer, so has more potent activity.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of an alkyl halide the carbanion can also undergo nucleophilic substitution with carbon-carbon bond formation. In substituted aromatic compounds an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, stabilizes a carbanion and the least-substituted olefin is generated. With an electron-donating substituent the opposite effect is obtained. The reaction produces more of the less <b>thermodynamically</b> stable non-conjugated 1,4-addition product than the more stable conjugated 1,3-diene because the largest orbital coefficient of the HOMO of the conjugated pentadienyl anion intermediate is on the central carbon atom. Once formed, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene is unable to equilibrate to the <b>thermodynamically</b> more stable product; therefore, the observed kinetic product is produced. Experimental alkali metal alternatives that are safer to handle, such as the M-SG reducing agent, also exist.|$|E
25|$|Energy as {{mechanical}} force (e.g. shear shaking) must be supplied {{into the system}} to force the oil to enter the water phase as oil droplets. Energy is needed for the process because the state of unprotected oil droplets in water is <b>thermodynamically</b> unfavorable (ΔG of the process is positive).|$|E
25|$|Because the {{hydration}} of {{sulfuric acid}} is <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable and the affinity {{of it for}} water is sufficiently strong, sulfuric acid is an excellent dehydrating agent. Concentrated sulfuric acid has a very powerful dehydrating property, removing water (H2O) from other compounds including sugar and other carbohydrates and producing carbon, heat, steam.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of hydrogen to {{double or triple}} bonds in hydrocarbons {{is a type of}} redox reaction that can be <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable. For example, the {{addition of}} hydrogen to an alkene has a Gibbs free energy change of -101 kJ·mol−1. However, the reaction rate for most hydrogenation reactions is negligible in the absence of catalysts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the metallointermediate formed is a {{saturated}} compound that can rotate and then break down, again detaching the alkene from the catalyst. Consequently, {{contact with a}} hydrogenation catalyst necessarily causes cis-trans-isomerization, because the isomerization is <b>thermodynamically</b> favorable. This {{is a problem in}} partial hydrogenation, while in complete hydrogenation the produced trans-alkene is eventually hydrogenated.|$|E
25|$|TNT is a {{reactive}} molecule and {{is particularly}} prone to react with reduced components of sediments or photodegradation {{in the presence}} of sunlight. TNT is <b>thermodynamically</b> and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly abiotic reactants, like photons, hydrogen sulfide, Fe2+, or microbial communities, both oxic and anoxic.|$|E
25|$|The term Cellulose I is {{used for}} this {{parallel}} arrangement, whereas crystalline fibrils bearing antiparallel polyglucan chains arise forming the <b>thermodynamically</b> stable Cellulose II. The molecular arrangement in the sheet, confirmed by X-ray diffraction, was such that the molecular chain axis lay randomly perpendicular to the thickness such that the (1 1 0) plane was oriented parallel to the surface.|$|E
