Their design follows three requirements: 1) resistance to multi-snapshot adversaries; and 2) ensuring that <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> {{will not be}} destroyed when a user is writing the public volume; and 3) using normal system operations on public data to disguise writes <b>to</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>data.</b> In ECD, the storage space is separated into two parts: a part containing the public data volume and the other containing the <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> volume. The <b>hidden</b> volume is visible to the system when the user enters the secret key. ECD uses a large volume of pseudorandom <b>data</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> the sensitive <b>data.</b> A portion of data from the volume are periodically migrated using normal firmware operations to obfuscate writes <b>to</b> the <b>hidden</b> <b>data.</b> Since <b>hidden</b> and pseudorandom <b>data</b> blocks are constantly relocated and modified, the <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> may eventually be overwritten without knowing the secret key.

However, network {{information hiding}} was already applied in the late 1980s by Girling and Wolf.Contrary to typical steganographic methods that use digital media (images, audio and video files) <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>data,</b> network steganography uses communication protocols' control elements and their intrinsic functionality.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of data that {{researchers}} must to protect when collecting, handling, storing and sharing data to safeguard the confidentiality of contributors. There are three primary types of information. Personally identifiable information includes any data that allows the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be realistically deduced by either direct or indirect means. Protected health information includes individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity. Other sensitive information that should be protected include data {{that if it were}} disclosed would have a significant likelihood to cause psychological, social, emotional, physical, or reputation harm. A common approach for data sharing that includes confidential material is through de-identification or anonymization. There are numerous techniques for the de-identification of data including simply removing specific variables or by using statistical techniques such as top-coding, collapsing or combining, sampling, swapping, or disturbing the data. For qualitative data, redaction can be used <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>data</b> elements that cannot be made public. However, it is important that future research requirements be taken into consideration when developing a de-identification or anonymization plan.|$|E
