50|$|If {{vehicles}} experience no delay as {{they travel}} from X1 to X2, then <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> vehicles at location X1 {{is represented by}} curve N1 and <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles at location X2 is represented by N2 in figure 8. More commonly, curve N1 is known as <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> curve <b>of</b> vehicles at location X1 and curve N2 is known as <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> curve <b>of</b> vehicles at location X2. Using a one-lane signalized approach to an intersection as an example, where X1 is {{the location of the}} stop bar at the approach and X2 is an arbitrary line on the receiving lane just across of the intersection, when the traffic signal is green, vehicles can travel through both points with no delay and {{the time it takes to}} travel that distance is equal to the free-flow travel time. Graphically, this is shown as the two separate curves in figure 8.|$|R

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, {{probably in}} relation to <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the rains {{and the availability of}} good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
