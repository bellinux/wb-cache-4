5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

25|$|The Rite of Acceptance {{may take}} place {{throughout}} the year.

25|$|The journal Animal Cognition {{stated that}} some birds {{preferred}} to work alone, while others {{like to work}} together as with African grey parrots. With two parrots, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> order of tasks or when they should do something together at once, but they have trouble exchanging roles. With three parrots, one parrot usually prefers to cooperate {{with one of the}} other two, but all of them are cooperating to solve the task.|$|E
25|$|The recent anecdotal {{reports of}} {{positive}} effects of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope. However, {{we must remember that}} these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.|$|E

25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E
25|$|Once in Harlem, a news {{broadcast}} about {{the bombing of}} the convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> <b>The</b> Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.|$|E
25|$|The 1804 {{silver dollar}} was {{actually}} produced in 1834, when the U.S. Department of State decided {{to produce a}} set of U.S. coins {{to be used as}} gifts to rulers in Asia in exchange for trade advantages. Since 1804 was the last recorded year of mintage for both the dollar and $10 Eagle, it was decided that the set would contain examples of those coins dated 1804, {{as well as the other}} denominations currently being produced. Mint officials, not realizing that the 19,000+ dollars recorded as being produced in 1804 were all dated 1803, proceeded to make new dies dated 1804. Little did <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> stunning rarity they were creating. Only 15 silver dollars with the date of 1804 are known to exist; in 1999, one of them sold at auction for more than $4 million. There are 8 Class I dollars, struck in 1834 for the aforementioned sets, 1 Class II dollar, struck over an 1857 Swiss Shooting Thaler (and now residing in the U.S. Coin Collection at the Smithsonian Institution), and 6 Class III dollars, struck surreptitiously sometime between 1858 and 1860 to meet collector demand for the coin.|$|E

25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> <b>The</b> requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k best ones (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time {{closer and closer to}} the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are the ones in the whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E

They feel like <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, just makes you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2015, {{following}} {{the closure of}} the 12 Bar Club and clearance of Enterprise Studios on Denmark Place, a group of musicians and supporters squatted in the club's premises and staged a demonstration in the street, protesting against redevelopment.

And <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> law, so they can't just be thrown out of there." [...] However, a report in The Independent judged the protest to be misguided, as most shops along the street were still trading.|$|E
500|$|Director Bharat Nalluri wanted {{as little}} of the torture {{to be seen as}} possible, because he wanted the {{sequence}} to be more psychological {{to make it easier to}} frighten the audience, since <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> physicality of being burnt, whereas if Helen was shot, not as many would. Producer Stephen Garrett wanted to show a more realistic sense of violence, rather than a fantastical [...] "cartoon violence" [...] "in which blows to the head with iron bars leave small bruises rather than crushed skulls, gunshot wounds leave neat abrasions in conveniently fleshy parts of the anatomy rather than eviscerating their victims; and fights that would hospitalise Mike Tyson are walked away from with barely a mark." ...|$|E

[...] For the song's music video, the word [...] "nigger" [...] was replaced with the phrase [...] "black boys". The music video ends with a black musician implanting an electric guitar into the ground and setting it on fire. The final image is similar to that of a burning cross.|$|E

500|$|Nimrod is more musically varied than {{previous}} Green Day albums.

[...] "Nice Guys Finish Last" [...] has been considered a song that [...] "eases the transition" [...] from Insomniac to Nimrod. Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times likened [...] "Worry Rock" [...] to the music of Elvis Costello. [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] has been referred to as a [...] "pop-punk campfire singalong ballad". After opening with Haden's violin solo, [...] "Hitchin' a Ride" [...] evolves into a bass-driven rock song with a [...] "Stray Cats vibe". Cool referred to [...] "Take Back" [...] (which features a more upfront hardcore-style, both musically and vocally) and [...] "Platypus (I Hate You)" [...] as [...] "some of the most punk songs we've ever done". [...] "Last Ride In" [...] is a surf rock-influenced instrumental, and [...] "King for a Day" [...] is a ska punk song featuring a horn section. [...] Armstrong compared the song to the Oi! genre, and noted [...] "It would be funny for a bunch of macho fraternity guys to be singing along and, little do <b>they</b> <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> song's about being in drag."
