5|$|A {{number of}} athletes may {{have served as}} {{alternates}} for the various teams in the bobsleigh events, although there is disagreement among sources as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> should be considered medal winners. They {{are listed in the}} International Olympic Committee's medalist database as having won medals for teams on which they were alternates. However, while they do appear in the Official Report of the 1932 Olympic Games on pages which list members of the teams, their names are not mentioned in the pages that list winners of the events. This list only includes those athletes who were listed in the Official Report as winners of the events.|$|E

5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky crag martin overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale crag martin, but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} known whether the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> were distinct species. Dusky crag martins from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that between individual martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions {{to quell the}} violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E

Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E

5|$|However, most 16th-century Europeans did not {{recognize}} that fossils were the remains of living organisms. The etymology of the word fossil comes from the Latin for things having been dug up. As this indicates, the term was applied {{to a wide variety}} of stone and stone-like objects without regard <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> might have an organic origin. 16th-century writers such as Gesner and Georg Agricola were more interested in classifying such objects by their physical and mystical properties than they were in determining the objects' origins. In addition, the natural philosophy of the period encouraged alternative explanations for the origin of fossils. Both the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy provided support for the idea that stony objects might grow within the earth to resemble living things. Neoplatonic philosophy maintained that there could be affinities between living and non-living objects that could cause one to resemble the other. The Aristotelian school maintained that the seeds of living organisms could enter the ground and generate objects resembling those organisms.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> cause cleft palate in {{a small number of}} babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} nine months, Quisling {{continued}} to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics. He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought {{to go on the}} offensive against its then-ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans. After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful thing he could do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway, that would let the Germans use Norway as a naval base. Thereafter, Norway would maintain official neutrality as long as possible, and finally the country would fall under German rather than British control. It is not clear how much Quisling himself understood about the strategic implications of such a move, and he instead relied on his future Minister of Domestic Affairs, Albert Hagelin, who was fluent in German, to put the relevant arguments to German officials in Berlin during pre-meeting talks, even though Hagelin was prone to damaging exaggeration at times. Quisling and his German contacts almost certainly went away with different views as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> had agreed upon the necessity of a German invasion.|$|E
