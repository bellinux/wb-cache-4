5|$|Adrenal <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging. They {{are seen in}} around 3.4% of CT scans, {{and in most cases}} they are benign adenomas. Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

30|$|Right: The {{histological}} type was papillotubular carcinoma and the <b>tumor</b> size <b>was</b> 9  ×  4  mm. There <b>was</b> another <b>tumor</b> on the lateral-caudal side. The histological type of this <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> a scirrhous carcinoma and the <b>tumor</b> size <b>was</b> 4  ×  2  mm. The first <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> {{located at}} the 1 o’clock position and the nipple–tumor distance (NT) was 7  cm. A second <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> {{located at the}} 12 o’clock position and NT was 5  cm. The <b>tumors</b> <b>were</b> separated by 2  cm. The immunostaining results for the first <b>tumor</b> <b>were</b> as follows: estrogen receptor (ER), 94  %; progesterone receptor (PgR), 96  %; HER- 2, negative and Ki- 67, 10  %.|$|R
40|$|A case of fibrous {{pseudotumor}} of {{the left}} spermatic cord is reported. The patient was a 4 -year-old boy with the complaint of swelling and pain {{of the left}} scrotal contents. An intrascrotal <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> suspected and surgical exploration was carried out. A small <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> resected and histological examination revealed fibrous pseudotumor. This <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> not a true neoplasm, but was due to an inflammatory disease. The clinical and histological findings of the <b>tumor</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
5|$|There is a three-tiered {{system for}} histologically {{classifying}} endometrial cancers, ranging from cancers with well-differentiated cells (grade I), to very poorly-differentiated cells (grade III). Grade I cancers {{are the least}} aggressive and have the best prognosis, while grade III <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> the most aggressive and likely to recur. Grade II cancers are intermediate between grades I and III in terms of cell differentiation and aggressiveness of disease.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> also common.|$|E
5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid <b>tumors)</b> <b>are</b> more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E
30|$|A 72 -year-old female {{was present}} a large round {{mass in the}} {{anterior}} mediastinum. The radiological examination led to a preoperative diagnosis of non-invasive thymoma. <b>Tumor</b> resection <b>was</b> undertaken via median sternotomy. Complete removal of the mediastinal <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> achieved. Pathological examination revealed that the <b>tumor</b> cells <b>were</b> spindle- and oval-shaped with atypia. Immunohistochemical work-up revealed that the <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> type A thymoma.

30|$|A Krukenberg tumor {{refers to}} {{gastrointestinal}} cancer that metastasizes to the ovaries; this <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> named after Krukenberg, who originally described this pathologic {{condition of the}} ovaries in 1896. The prognosis of this <b>tumor</b> <b>is</b> uniformly poor [1]. In the malignant state, the torsion of ovarian <b>tumor</b> <b>is</b> a rare condition because of the adhesions associated with malignant lesions. Two cases of torsion of Krukenberg <b>tumors</b> have <b>been</b> reported so far [2, 3].|$|R
30|$|Ability of {{ultrasound}} {{to localize}} the <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> defined as either well localized or poorly localized [23]: A well-localized <b>tumor</b> <b>is</b> a <b>tumor</b> that <b>was</b> well visualized by IOUS {{in the initial}} acquisitions by having a clearly different echogenicity than that of surrounding brain or other structures. A poorly localized <b>tumor</b> <b>was</b> a <b>tumor</b> that <b>is</b> not well visualized by IOUS due to any obstacles after exhausting all means to overcome these obstacles like changing the probe position or the operating table position and changing the transducer frequencies.|$|R

40|$|The calcifying {{epithelial}} odontogenic <b>tumor</b> <b>is</b> a rare benign odontogenic <b>tumor</b> that <b>was</b> {{first described}} by Pindborg in 1955.

Noncalcifying Pindborg <b>tumor</b> <b>is</b> very rare and only three cases have been documented in the English language literature so far. We present an additional case of noncalcifying Pindborg tumor and review the previously reported cases.

25|$|Yolk sac tumors, {{formerly}} called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10–20% {{of ovarian}} germ cell malignancies, {{and have the}} worst prognosis of all ovarian germ cell tumors. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of people with yolk sac <b>tumors</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred.

40|$|In this {{prospective}} study, 609 solid {{thyroid gland}} <b>tumors</b> <b>were</b> percutaneously probed using standard 25 -gauge fine needles, their tissue toughness ranked {{on the basis}} of the nature and strength of the haptic force feedback cues, and subjected to standard fine needle biopsy.
