5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate <b>the</b> <b>straw</b> from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E

Mean value of the initial force was maximal for mixed straw pellet samples 52. 49 N.

5|$|Inocybe cookei, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>straw</b> fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola, and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species {{can be found in}} Europe, Asia and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour, with a prominent umbo, fibres on the cap and a distinctive bulb {{at the base of the}} stem. It grows from soil in mixed woodland, and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of ectomycorrhiza. Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and non-toxic, but either way, is not advised for consumption.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} kaolin and calcite {{additives}} on <b>the</b> rye <b>straw</b> ash sintering behaviors were investigated. <b>The</b> rye <b>straw</b> ash {{has a high}} sintering tendency, with observation of severe fusion during combustion. The formation and melting of potassium silicates play key roles in sintering of <b>the</b> rye <b>straw</b> ash at elevated temperatures. Fusion characteristics temperatures of <b>the</b> rye <b>straw</b> ash were significantly increased upon kaolin and calcite addition. Kaolin addition led to formation of high temperature melting potassium aluminum silicates, which were revealed by XRD analyses. Due to formation of high temperature melting species due to kaolin addition, the severe sintering of <b>the</b> rye <b>straw</b> ash was significantly reduced. Addition of calcite provided CaO to react with silica in <b>the</b> rye <b>straw</b> ash, causing generation of high temperature melting calcium rich silicates.
