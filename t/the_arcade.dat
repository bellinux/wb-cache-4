5|$|Critical {{reaction}} was generally favourable, with reviewers being {{impressed by the}} beauty of the graphics and the thrilling depiction of speed. They were however, slightly disappointed with the shallow nature of the gameplay. A newer version of <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> game was released in 2003, incorporating motion simulator technology into <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is {{an action}} game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

50|$|Like <b>the</b> {{original}} Turtles <b>arcade</b> game, Turtles in Time {{was released}} for <b>the</b> <b>arcades</b> as a dedicated 4-player cabinet, {{as well as}} a 2-player conversion kit.

5|$|Just {{alongside}} Burlington House {{is one of}} London's most luxurious shopping areas, the Burlington Arcade. It {{was designed}} by Samuel Ware for George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington in 1819. <b>The</b> <b>arcade</b> was designed with tall walls on either side primarily to stop passers by throwing litter into the Earl's garden. Ownership of <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> subsequently passed down to the Chesham family. In 1911, another storey was added by Beresford Pite, who also added the Chesham arms. The family sold <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> to the Prudential Assurance Company for £333,000 (now £) in 1926. It was bombed during World War II and subsequently restored.|$|E
5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer Instinct was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> version to run on the console. <b>The</b> <b>arcade</b> version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} {{remake of}} the original arcade game on the Game Boy, named Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong '94 contains levels from both the original Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. arcades. It starts with the same damsel-in-distress premise and four basic locations as <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> game and then progresses to 97 additional puzzle-based levels. It is the first game to have built-in enhancement for the Super Game Boy accessory. <b>The</b> <b>arcade</b> version makes an appearance in Donkey Kong 64 in the Frantic Factory level.|$|E
50|$|However, Benjamin's {{vision of}} <b>the</b> <b>Arcades</b> project grew {{increasingly}} ambitious in scope until he perceived it as representing {{his most important}} creative accomplishment. On several occasions Benjamin altered his overall scheme of <b>the</b> <b>Arcades</b> Project, {{due in part to}} the influence of Theodor Adorno, who gave Benjamin a stipend and who expected Benjamin to make <b>the</b> <b>Arcades</b> project more explicitly political and Marxist in its analysis.|$|R

50|$|The bridge has 3 brick arcades {{covered with}} white marble. Between <b>the</b> <b>arcades</b> {{there are two}} single-lancet windows with rounded arches. <b>The</b> <b>arcades</b> divide <b>the</b> Tiber into 3 {{branches}} by 2 pillars that vaguely look like ships.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> game. Some have Donkey Kong {{on the left side of}} the screen in the barrel level (like he is in <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E

5|$|In a {{gameplay}} mode {{exclusive to}} Western releases, <b>the</b> <b>Arcade</b> mode converts {{the game in}} a traditional fighting game, with all RPG elements removed and characters' abilities being stripped down to the basics to balance the playing field. Within <b>the</b> <b>Arcade</b> Mode, there are three tiers: Normal, Hard, and Time Attack; beating any tier of <b>the</b> <b>Arcade</b> mode will reward the player with PP (player points) and special items {{that can be used}} in story mode. All characters, including villains, are playable in Arcade mode; for example, Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht are available for use in this mode from the start, but they still need to be bought via the PP Catalog for use in other modes.|$|E
5000|$|Internally <b>the</b> <b>arcades</b> are in {{different}} styles, <b>the</b> south <b>arcade</b> being Early English while <b>the</b> north <b>arcade</b> is Perpendicular.

50|$|Benjamin first {{mentioned}} <b>the</b> <b>Arcades</b> {{project in}} a 1927 {{letter to his}} friend Gershom Scholem, describing it as his attempt to use collage techniques in literature. Initially, Benjamin saw <b>the</b> <b>Arcades</b> as a small article he would finish within a few weeks.|$|R
50|$|In February 2017 it was {{announced}} via The Heart of Gaming's Facebook page that <b>the</b> <b>arcade's</b> new location had changed to the Whitgift Centre of Croydon. <b>The</b> <b>arcade's</b> new venue was initially planned to open on March 4th 2017, but eventually opened on April 29th 2017.|$|R

5|$|Mario Bros. {{was only}} {{modestly}} successful in Japanese arcades. <b>The</b> <b>arcade</b> cabinets have since become mildly rare. To date in Japan, the NES version of Mario Bros. {{has sold more}} than 1.63 million copies, and the Famicom Mini re-release of the NES version {{has sold more than}} 90,000 copies. Despite being released during the North American video game crash of 1983, <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> game (as well as the industry) was not affected. Video game author Dave Ellis considers it one of the more memorable classic games.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2017 the {{original}} arcade version of Mario Bros. was released for the Nintendo Switch {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Arcade</b> Archives series of emulated arcade machine games.|$|E
50|$|Gauntlet(1985) and Quartet(1986) {{introduced}} co-op 4-player gaming to <b>the</b> <b>arcades.</b> <b>The</b> games had broader consoles {{to allow}} for four sets of controls.|$|R
50|$|Three <b>arcades</b> make up <b>the</b> {{interior}} {{space of the}} sanctuary. They are parallel to the direction of prayer which is towards Mecca in modern-day Saudi Arabia. <b>The</b> <b>arcades</b> are supported by two rows of stone Corinthian columns. Each of <b>the</b> <b>arcades</b> contain two levels. The first level consists of large semi-circular arches, while the second level {{is made up of}} double arches. This pattern is the same repeated by <b>the</b> <b>arcades</b> of <b>the</b> courtyard. <b>The</b> three interior <b>arcades</b> intersect in <b>the</b> center of the sanctuary with a larger, higher arcade that is perpendicular to the qibla ("direction of prayer") wall and faces the mihrab (niche in the wall which indicates the qibla) and the minbar ("pulpit"). The central transept divides <b>the</b> <b>arcades</b> into two halves each with eleven arches. The entire sanctuary measures 136 m by 37 m and takes up the southern half of the mosque complex.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arcade</b> {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land amassed {{moderate}} sales, and the Master System version received overall positive reviews {{in all aspects}} and has been highly {{regarded as one of}} the better titles in the Master System library. Reviews praised the game for its colorful graphics, smooth controls, gameplay, and replay value. Other ports received mixed reception: criticisms included very slow multi-load times on the home computer versions, sub-quality sound, and smaller play areas. <b>The</b> <b>arcade</b> version would later be re-released in emulated form as a digital download for Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|The scoring for {{the home}} version is {{proportionally}} {{identical to the original}} except that each item is worth 1/10th its arcade value, with the bonus Vitamins as the only variation, being worth 100 points, which is the equivalent of the 1000 point scoring melon bonus item that appears in the 7th and 8th levels of <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> game. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> version, if Pac-Man loses a life while the vitamin appears, the vitamin may not necessarily be forfeited.|$|E
5|$|A Joust-themed pinball {{table was}} {{released}} in 1983, designed by Barry Oursler and Constantino Mitchell. The game includes artwork and themes from <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> version.

5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to <b>the</b> <b>arcade</b> after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of <b>the</b> <b>arcade.</b> The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|A soundtrack CD, Ninja Ryukenden: Tecmo GSM-1, was {{released}} by Pony Canyon in February 1989. The {{first half of the}} CD starts with an arranged medley of the game's music.
