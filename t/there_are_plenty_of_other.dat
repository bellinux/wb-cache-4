60|$|Now, it's {{all very}} well that these big people should be frightened out of their wits by an old wife talking with her mouth shut; {{that is one of}} the things we happen to know about. All the old women in the world might talk with their mouths shut, and not frighten you or me, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things that frighten us badly. And if we only knew about them, perhaps we should find them no more worthy to be feared than an old woman talking with her mouth shut. And the names of some of these things are Death, and Pain, and Sorrow.|$|E

"Look here, Philip," [...] {{she said}} firmly, [...] "I won't have {{you look at}} me as though I were {{something}} inhuman. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> women like me in the world, even if they are not quite so frank about it. I want to live, and I will live, and I grudge every moment out of which I am not extracting the fullest amount of happiness. That's because I've paid. It's the woman's bargaining instinct, you know. She wants to get value.... Now I want to hear about Miss Dalstan. Where did you meet her, and how did you get her to accept your play?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Notwithstanding {{all this}} he still hankers after her and swears she shall be his. He {{is not a}} bad-looking fellow, and from what we know of the market, we should say <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> girls who would jump at him; yet {{for the sake of}} {{settling}} down with this dismal young female as his wife, he is prepared to go through a laborious and exhaustive course of crime and to be bullied and insulted by every one he meets. His love sustains him under it all. He robs and forges, and cheats, and lies, and murders, and arsons. If there were any other crimes he could commit to win her affection, he would, for her sweet sake, commit them cheerfully. But he doesn't know any others--at all events, he is not well up in any others--and she still does not care for him, and what is he to do? ...|$|E

60|$|But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> gas. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no {{discernible}} {{reason why the}} car should not go. She started the engine. It ran for half a minute and quit. All the plugs showed sparks. No wires were detached in the distributor. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> water, and the oil was not clogged. And that ended Claire's knowledge of {{the inside of a}} motor.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} to to-morrow's, as you will see," [...] Mr Harvey replied. [...] "Traders {{consider}} this defile {{to be the very}} hardest passage anywhere in South Africa, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bad bits too. In many cases you will see we shall have to unload the waggons, and it will be all that a double team can do to pull them up empty. Sometimes of course the defile is easier than at others; it depends much upon the action of the last floods. In some years rocks and boulders have been jammed so thickly in the narrow parts that the defile has been absolutely impassable; the following year, perhaps, the obstruction has been swept away, or to a certain extent levelled by the spaces between the rocks being filled up with small stones and sand. How it is this season, I do not know; up to the time we left I had heard of no trader having passed along this way. I have spoken of it as a day's journey, but it is only under the most favourable circumstances that it has ever been accomplished in that time, and sometimes traders have been three or four days in getting through." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> club-bores {{besides the}} man who rates these {{generally}} affable and well-behaved persons, the club servants. One of the worst is {{the man who}}m you never see anywhere except at the club, and whom you never fail to see there. It is bad enough when you have no acquaintance with him. Murders have probably been committed by sensitive persons for no better reason (often for worse reasons) than that they are tired of seeing some one else going about. His voice, his manner, his cough, especially his cough, become unendurable. People who cough in clubs are generally amateurs of the art. They are huskier, more wheezing, more pertinacious in working away at a cough till they have made it a masterpiece than any other mortals. We believe that club Asthmats (it is quite as good a word as [...] "AEsthetes") practise in the Reading Room of the British Museum, where they acquire their extraordinary compass and mastery of various notes. Be this as it may, the cough which drives every one but its owner {{out of the room}} (though doubtless an affliction to the proprietor) gives him rank as a club-bore of the finest water. The bore who always enters into conversation, though he has nothing to say, merely because you used to dislike him at school, or college, or elsewhere, is another common annoyance. The man who is engaged, apparently, on a large work, and who rushes about the library hunting for Proclus and Jamblichus when other occupants of the room wish to be quiet, is naturally detested.|$|E
