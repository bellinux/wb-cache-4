40|$|Proposition of {{answer from}} the INRIA-ATLAS {{team to the}} OMG Request For Information named "MDA Tool Capabilities"In the past years, the INRIA ATLAS Group has been {{building}} an MDA <b>tool</b> <b>bench</b> named AMMA (ATLAS Model Management Architecture). The present discusses the main characteristics and overall vision of this platform {{in the context of}} the OMG MDA Tool Capabilities RFI. In the following pages, we will provide an overall description of what MDA tool capabilities means for the ATLAS Group. We will show, within this response, how our overall Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) vision and implemented platform bring answers to the different RFI questions. We will also highlight the various MDA tool-specific needs and requirements we have already identified, even though some are not yet fully addressed by the current version of our platform. In a more organizational point of view, we have tried to follow as much as possible the logical sequence of the RFI proposed questions; however in many cases we have answered several questions at once. Our goal is not to answer exhaustively all the questions but more to cover all the different requirement areas...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the rational order of disk tools placement on the working body {{is necessary to}} know {{the maximum amount of}} rock, destroyed by the disk <b>tool</b> in <b>benching</b> cutting mode depending on the tool geometry parameters, physical and mechanical parameters of rocks. The article contains the definition of rational parameters of cutting disk tools as well as power and energy parameters of the destruction process by cutting disks and by executive body of the coal cutter. The rational geometric parameters of cutting discs are specified. It was found that each step of cutting with a minimum depth of penetration has its own maximum height of bench outcrop. The dependence of the volumes of large items destroyed by the disk tool on the cutting step height was determined. The existence of the cyclic alternation of destruction phases, regardless the fracture parameters, the height of the ledge outcrop, and tools like free cutting geometry were found. In contrast to the free cutting in benching mode of destruction two large fragments of rocks in one cycle were observed. Consequently, the cyclical nature of the destruction process in the benching mode will be characterized by two chips and crushing, and this cycling repeats throughout the destruction process with the same parameters of destruction...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the potential of}} implementing watt-level class-AB Power Amplifier (PA) for WLAN in 65 nm CMOS technology, at 2. 4 GHz frequency. In total, five PAs have been compared, where the examined parameters were output power (Pout), linearity, power added efficiency (PAE), and area consumption. Four PAs were implemented using conventional cascode topology with different combination of transistors sizes in 65 nm CMOS, and one PA using a high-voltage Extended Drain MOS (EDMOS) device, implemented in the same 65 nm CMOS with no process or mask changes. All schematics were created using Cadence Virtuoso CAD <b>tools.</b> The test <b>benches</b> were created using the Agilent's Advance Design System (ADS) and simulated with the ADS-Cadence dynamic link. The simulation {{results show that the}} EDMOS PA (L= 350 nm) has the smallest area, but has harder to reach the required Pout. Cascode no. 3 (L= 500, 260 nm) has the best Pout (29. 1 dBm) and PAE (49. 5 %). Cascode no. 2 (L= 500, 350 nm) has the best linearity (low EVM). Cascode no. 1 (L= 500, 500 nm) has low Pout (27. 7 dBm). Cascode no. 4 (L= 500, 60 nm) has very bad linearity.

Part {{of this work}} {{has been reported in}} 15418 R 03. Most of portions of these tasks have been executed independently. We progressed steadily and completed some of the sub-tasks, while others are still on going. We achieved the goals that we had set up in the task schedule. Reviewing the results of this work period indicates that our plan is solid and we did not encounter any unforeseen problems. The work plan will continue as scheduled. A midyear review will be presented in November or December 2004. Several independent tasks pursuant the statement of project objectives have been executed simultaneously and are still on-going. Use of real seismic test data is augmented by the creation a 3 D ray tracing synthetic test data. We used the previously constructed 3 D layered model and simulated data acquisition from a set of circular source locations at the surface of the model, while a close to vertical VSP well was used to capture the wave field data. The source pattern was optimized with respect to Fresnel zone width at the target depth. Multi-component particle displacements were recorded every 50 ft down with an array length of 4, 000 ft. P-P as well as P-S reflections were specified in the resulting wave field. We ensured a large enough aperture with enough fine sampling to perform advanced processing, imaging and analysis tests in the future during this project. We constantly improved the interfacing of our software libraries with newly designed 3 C display classes and mechanisms. We used the previously implemented 3 C Work <b>Bench</b> <b>tool</b> as the primary prototyping <b>tool.</b> This work <b>bench</b> allows to load as well as manipulate and display data items in a flexible manner. We continued to demonstrate its basic functionality by loading source maps, horizons, seismic and velocity volumes, well logs into the tool, performing basic QC steps as is necessary in normal processing. We improved functionality by adding multiple windowing options to each of the display items. The windows can be docked or un-docked, which is advantageous in a practical sense, since the display real estate can be spread across multiple display monitors. All windows transparently tie into the same item tree and views get updated dynamically and transparently. Each display item can be associated with a particular display widget as is the case for the multi-component hodogram display widget. All tasks were performed successfully, ensuring the continued progress of this project as outlined in the original proposal. Deliverables generated during this time period consist of reporting details and synthetically modeled seismic data for a 3 D layered geological model. The numerically modeled SEGY data, as well as the model representation data, are ready to be sent out to DOE facilities for archiving.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid growth}} of online {{publications}} such as the Medline and other sources raises the questions {{how to get the}} relevant information efficiently. It is important, for a bench scientist, e. g., to monitor related publications constantly. It is also important, for a clinician, e. g., to access the patient records anywhere and anytime. Although time-consuming, this kind of searching procedure is usually similar and simple. Likely, it involves a search engine and a visualization interface. Different words or combination reflects different research topics. The objective {{of this study is to}} automate this tedious procedure by recording those words/terms in a database and online sources, and use the information for an automated search and retrieval. The retrieved information will be available anytime and anywhere through a secure web server. Results We developed such a database that stored searching terms, journals and et al., and implement a piece of software for searching the medical subject heading-indexed sources such as the Medline and other online sources automatically. The returned information were stored locally, as is, on a server and visible through a Web-based interface. The search was performed daily or otherwise scheduled and the users logon to the website anytime without typing any words. The system has potentials to retrieve similarly from non-medical subject heading-indexed literature or a privileged information source such as a clinical information system. The issues such as security, presentation and visualization of the retrieved information were thus addressed. One of the presentation issues such as wireless access was also experimented. A user survey showed that the personalized online searches saved time and increased and relevancy. Handheld devices could also be used to access the stored information but less satisfactory. Conclusion The Web-searching software or similar system has potential to be an efficient <b>tool</b> for both <b>bench</b> scientists and clinicians for their daily information needs. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} autophagy, or bulk {{degradation}} of cellular proteins and organelles through an autophagosomic-lysosomal pathway constantly functions in all eukary- otic cells. Also {{a type of}} physiological cell death exists, which is best characterized with the strenghtening of the autophagic process, but no DNA degradation or caspase activation can be detected, in contrast to apoptosis [2]. Autophagy can be promoted in various ways: addiction of certain drugs (like vin- blastine [6]), hormones (like 20 -hidroxy-ecdysone [3]) or simply nutrition d&epriva- tion [5] leads to the increased amount of proteins degraded by lysosomal enzymes. The isolation and cloning of yeast autophagy mutants gives an excellent opportu- nity to examine their putative homologs in Drosophila melanogaster. Fourteen genes {{have been identified in}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for autophagy [5], based on several mutant phenotypes, &like the sorting problems of vacuolar enzymes such as carboxypeptidase Y or aminopeptidase I, or the less of viability and the inability of degrading cytosolic proteins like fatty acid synthase during starvation. Nine of them (apg 5, apg 6, apg 7, apg 12, aut 1, aut 2, aut 7, aut 9, vps 4) appear to have clear homologs in the fly and human genome, using the BLAST <b>tools</b> at [URL] <b>bench.</b> sdsc. edu, [URL] and [URL] (BLASTN, TBLASTN services) for sequence similarity searches. The sequence alignment of the yeast, fly and human proteins can be seen in Figure 1. The high degree of similarity suggests existing homology among these genes, although new and lost functions were identified in some cases [7]. Remarkably, vps 4 exists in two slightly different copies in human, and aut 7 exists in multiple different copies as well (two in Drosophila and three in Homo), suggesting different roles, or at least different regulation. As expected, fly and human genes are much more simi- lar to each other than to the yeast homolog, promising that Drosophila experiments will better contribute {{to the understanding of the}} roles of these genes in detail in high- er eukaryotes. The precise function of these genes is still unclear, however, molecu...|$|R
40|$|International @ AIR+DVI:FDA:CFE:EPU:JMC:CGUInternational audienceThe Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) {{seems to}} be a {{promising}} technique for commercial air cleaning applications 1. However besides the numerous scientific publications 2, 3 there are still potential drawbacks inherent with this technology, like the risk of dangerous by-products generations by incomplete reactions. The absence of standard methodologies in order to evaluate the real performance of the process are the main issues {{that need to be addressed}} to ensure successful applications. In order to better understand the photocatalytic process in indoor air treatments the Normacat Project was established by two french laboratories (IRCELYON, IPREM) and several industrials. It has as main objectives the development of: i) new experimental approaches, <b>tools</b> and test <b>benches</b> to measure the efficiencies of photocatalytic media under typical indoor air conditions, ii) new photocatalytic materials iii) and to give recommendations to improve materials and systems. The photocatalytic performance of PCO medias were study using two different test benches: a photoreactor designed according to the standard ISO 22197 at realistic low VOCs concentrations (< 20 ppbv) and a new experimental close-loop reactor using high air velocities (m s- 1 range), equivalent to those encountered in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditions) systems. Robust sensitive analytical methods were also developed: for the conversion of the initial VOCs, a chromatograph equiped with a pulsed photoionization detector (GC-PID), for the quantification and identification of the reaction by-products an automated thermal desorption technique coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (ATD-GC-MS), for the analysis of CO, CO 2 at ppbv levels a gas chromatograph equiped with a plasma emission detector (GC-PED) and for the on-line formaldehyde and acetaldehyde detection at low levels a gas chromatograph equiped with a pulsed discharge helium photoionization detector (GC-PDHID). A representative VOC mixture found in buildings (Toluene, n-Heptane, Acetone, Acetaldehyde and Formaldehyde) was used as target pollutants at typical indoor air levels. The influence of the different supports (organic cellulose, glass fibers, quartz fibers, ceramic foam and active carbon) on the photocatalytic activity used by commercial PCO air cleanear systems was studied and evaluated in terms of conversion, mineralization (CO 2) and by-products formation. The effects of different parameters (humidity level, residence time, inlet concentrations UV lamps, radiation intensity) will be also discussed...|$|R
