5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed <b>that</b> <b>Rich</b> had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E

Wikileaks fueled the conspiracy theories by offering a reward of $20,000 for information leading to the capture of Rich's killer and hinting <b>that</b> <b>Rich</b> may have been the source of the leaked emails. No evidence supports the claim <b>that</b> <b>Rich</b> was the source of the leaks.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{research}} has {{confirmed that the}} 1,400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island in 1577 and 1578 were not gold-bearing. Moreover, the original black stone on which Agnello conducted his tests in January 1577 had been found on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage; according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.|$|E
25|$|Other small incomes {{came from}} customs fees and fines. In {{times of war}} a special tax was levied on rich {{citizens}}.

The taxes were used to maintain the triremes which gave Athens great naval power and to pay and maintain a chorus for large religious festivals. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> Athenian men saw it as an honor to sponsor the triremes (probably because they became leaders of it for the period they supported it) or the festivals and they often engaged in competitive donating.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th century <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> oil fields were {{discovered}} in the area. On 16 July 1909, after secret negotiation with the British consul, Percy Cox, assisted by Arnold Wilson, Sheik Khaz'al agreed to a rental agreement for the island including Abadan. The Sheik continued to administer the island until 1924. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company built their first pipeline terminus oil refinery in Abadan, starting in 1909 and completing it in 1912, with oil flowing by August 1912 (see Abadan Refinery). Refinery throughput numbers rose from 33,000 tons in 1912-1913 to 4,338,000 tons in 1931. By 1938, it was the largest in the world.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electronic}} autonomous robots {{with complex}} behaviour {{were created by}} William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> connections between {{a small number of}} brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} dynasty the type of tomb {{constructed}} changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over , however it is possible for this to be several tombs which have met in the making of a tomb; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs. The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The work at Dartford thus {{came to a}} halt. In {{a report}} in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern {{research}} has shown that the real problem was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the assay method was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but little of that ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did not mine at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.|$|E

25|$|There were roughly three {{positions}} {{on the future of}} the Dutch economy. The CDA claimed that the reforms were finished and that the following cabinet would not have to take any serious measures. The VVD wanted to continue reforming to increase the performance of the Dutch economy. They wanted to continue to cut taxes and reduce bureaucracy. The opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL, joined by the ChristianUnion wanted to revert some of the measures and pay more attention to the public sector, especially to the health care-sector and the poor. The PvdA and the GreenLeft however also announced that they wanted to reform part of the economy and welfare system. For instance several months before the elections, Wouter Bos, the leader of Labour Party, announced that he wanted to tax the elderly pension in such a way <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> elderly would pay more taxes on their pensions than poor elderly. The Dutch pension system consists of government supplied (AOW) and mandatory self-saved pensions. It is the latter portion Bos wanted to tax progressively. The proposal led to considerable controversy, both outside and within Bos' own party. Former minister and de Volkskrant columnist Marcel van Dam wrote a critical column on 22 June concerning Bos' proposal. The second man of the Christian Democratic Appeal Maxime Verhagen used soundbites from the proposal continually to emphasise that the PvdA was an unreliable partner for the elderly. Bos later moderated his plans: only new cases would pay taxes over their pension.|$|E

But equally important was {{the fact that he was}} someone I could trust, who had a similar sense of taste and values." [...] He stayed until 2001. For his work on The Simpsons and King of the Hill, Appel won three Primetime Emmy Awards. Appel created the short-lived series A.U.S.A., which aired in 2003, which he based on his own experiences as an assistant U.S. attorney.|$|E

50|$|Clinton's critics alleged <b>that</b> <b>Rich's</b> pardon {{had been}} bought, as Denise Rich had given more than $1 million to Clinton's {{political}} party (the Democratic Party), {{including more than}} $100,000 to the Senate campaign of the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation during Clinton's time in office.|$|R
30|$|The {{rest of the}} {{coefficients}} have the expected sign or have no impact at all—e.g. gender of respondent does not impact WTP, a respondent with a full-time job reports higher WTP than a respondent with no job, older respondents tend to report higher WTP, and richer respondents tend to report higher WTP with exception of the richest respondents. Several possibilities are behind the negative sign associated with the richest respondents. A first explanation is <b>that</b> <b>richer</b> people may already be taking precautions against air pollution and, therefore, be less willing {{to contribute to a}} public good. For instance, if richer respondents have already bought indoor air purifiers and/or own houses with large gardens, they may be less willing to pay for a cleaner air. This explanation, of course, does not exclude the possibility <b>that</b> <b>richer</b> respondents may be intrinsically more selfish.|$|R
500|$|The Economist criticized Cowen for associating the {{economic}} problems resulting from the 2008 financial crisis to his broader thesis, arguing instead that this was mostly caused by a demand shock and mostly preventable. [...] Some scholars, such as Jim Rickards, Howard Qi, Hongbin Song, etc., {{point out that the}} demand shock was only the phenomenon, a result of a more serious underlying structural problem in the American economy. Furthermore, Howard Qi argues that the education in the US is not conducive to producing high quality scientists and engineers from the American citizens. Instead, the US is becoming increasingly and vitally relying on foreign students in the US universities to support the intellectual need in the US's science and engineering. Matthew Yglesias also disagreed with the link: [...] "Rich countries have experienced very divergent fates over the past 36 months when the key evidence for the technological stagnation thesis is <b>that</b> <b>rich</b> countries have experienced a broadly similar fate over the past 36 years", he writes.|$|E
