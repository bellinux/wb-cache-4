There's a simple continuity there. It's the accumulation of these moments that I can slowly but surely play that make it even stronger.|$|E
60|$|Such, at any rate, was the {{explanation}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely. If {{we wanted}} further proof, {{he was an}} American. You {{recollect}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> that the man in Wales was American." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> night <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> Felicity {{talking to}} Cecily in their room.|$|R
5000|$|Lovely tales <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> or read... (Endymion (poem), John Keats) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we were misinformed," [...] {{the officer}} said; [...] "the news was {{received}} {{last night that}} the Earl of Peterborough was himself here; and although it was but in the afternoon <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> your general was at Valencia, his movements are so swift and erratic <b>that,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> of him in Portugal one hour {{we should not be}} surprised to find him here the next." [...] He stopped as shots were heard fired in the streets.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, beyond <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> he {{was very}} dangerously hit indeed. He is either at the church or town-hall. Both have been turned into hospitals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was right}} here <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> it," [...] Sam said, as {{he pointed to the}} shovels they had left behind, in order to mark the spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Angela, {{what was}} the name of the gentleman who {{delivered}} that delightful course of lectures <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> in Geneva, on--{{what was the}} title?--'The Redeeming Features of the Pagan Morality.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Acts 6:11 [...] "Then they suborned men, saying <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> him {{speaking}} blasphemous words (rhemata) against Moses and God." ...|$|R
60|$|In a {{few words}} I told her the tale <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard</b> from the dying soldier, and she listened eagerly.|$|R
60|$|Finally he {{abandoned}} his task, {{shaking his head}} gravely. At <b>that</b> moment, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp's own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} his Sahara of his palm, and the Reverend laid his {{diminutive}} hand in it, and got so cordial a shake <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> his glove burst under it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you; it's {{nearly the}} same story <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard.</b> But {{you have had a}} long ride, Mr. Thompson; let me offer you a glass of whiskey in the dining-room. This way, please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; we {{have heard}} nothing except a few distant shouts and noises out at the lines. Round here there has been nothing moving, except <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> someone {{go out into the}} garden just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What must be done,' said Traddles, 'is this. First, {{the deed}} of relinquishment, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> of, {{must be given}} over to me now--here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Will {{that bore}} of a tenor ever finish that {{provoking}} aria, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> so often? How drawlingly he drags on his dull, deafening-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{been very}} ill, Rob; {{and the doctor}} said to-day <b>that</b> unless <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> from you soon {{he would not be}} able to save her life. The {{uncertainty}} about you is killing her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The refuge is near at hand," [...] Cuthbert said. [...] "It {{is but a}} {{few yards}} round yonder point. It is well <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> your voice. I fear that your horse has fallen a victim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{the news}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> shouted {{in the streets}} as we came thither, true, your highness?" [...] one of the councillors asked as they entered. [...] "That our fleet has gained a victory over the Genoese?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the report}} of their guns <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> and fortune had been unkind to them, else death would have come during the fight. It had been delayed {{that it might be}} {{accompanied}} by the keenest torture.|$|E
60|$|I stopped abruptly, for at <b>that</b> moment <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a sound <b>that</b> sent {{a thrill}} to our hearts. It was {{something}} between a rend and a crash. We {{looked at each}} other in consternation.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> {{no one is}} a bad sign, Roger; for {{it would}} seem to show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must have gone a long way out of our course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been <b>that</b> tree <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> sliding down the {{mountain}} side," [...] exclaimed Dick. [...] "Maybe Tom didn't go down into the chasm at all, but slid down the mountain on the tree!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder, Minnie, that Swankie did {{not dare}} to offer such things for sale. He would {{certainly}} have been found out. Wasn't it lucky <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> him tell Spink the spot under his floor where he had hidden them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{takes my}} breath away," [...] the girl murmured. [...] "Now I think of it, of course, it is Deane's cottage they are in. He was there himself {{only a few}} weeks ago. It was through him <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> of my uncle's murder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have fancied," [...] {{the officer}} said, [...] "for {{the last two}} hours <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> distant firing; but we could not be sure, for any noise echoes so, in these mountains. I will set out at once with you, with as many men as I can spare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can talk}} about that later. It will be some time before the mine is yours, and I'm not certain <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> the last of Stormont." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> night <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{the story}} of how he had {{performed}} the feat of riding all the way from Rome in four-and-twenty hours, fleeing for his life from the peril of assassination, of which Madonna Lucrezia had warned him.|$|R
60|$|La Fosse {{bowed and}} came over with the message <b>that</b> already <b>we</b> had <b>heard.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Flora Schuyler, [...] "we know <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> it {{with the}} Kaiser in Berlin. Only one man could have written it; but his own countrymen could not play it better than you do. A little overwhelming. How did {{you get down to}} the spirit of it, Hetty?" ...|$|E
60|$|Here one of them, at any rate, {{must have}} {{travelled}} fast enough, for it seemed {{only a few}} seconds later <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a terrific yell beneath us, and craning over the rock I saw the Prince Joshua running up the ladder more swiftly than ever did any London lamplighter when I was a boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Murgh," [...] said Hugh, {{stepping}} forward, [...] "you had best let me and {{my companion}} Grey Dick walk first down this place, lest you should come to harm. When we passed it a while ago we thought <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> robbers behind us, and in Venice, as we are told, such men use knives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a moment, Mr. Crabtree," [...] {{interrupted}} {{the owner of}} the Hall. [...] "I am conducting this investigation. Now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> the stories of the principals we'll hear what the witnesses have to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We thought <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> musketry," [...] {{the colonel}} replied, [...] "but {{it might have}} been only fancy. There is such a hullabaloo in the city <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might not have heard the fire of small-arms, but I think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must have <b>heard</b> artillery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> what Colonel Quaritch had to say," [...] {{she said}} in her softest voice, and {{addressing}} her father, [...] "there is no reason why we should not finish our business with Mr. Cossey." ...|$|R
