5|$|Most {{living things}} that are {{visible to the naked}} eye in <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.|$|E

5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies in <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> stage {{can live}} from {{a week to}} nearly a year {{depending}} on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a caterpillar. Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the quantitative and seasonal variation in percentage of juveniles {{in the commercial}} trawl fishery of Mangalore and Malpe in 2006 and discusses the possible impacts of juvenile fish fishery on fish stock in terms of quantity and value. Twenty finfishes and five shellfishes were identified in which considerable quantity of juveniles were caught, and the juvenile fishery is making notable impact on adult fishery. To understand {{the impact of the}} fishery of juveniles in a holistic manner, the species of juveniles caught by trawlers are categorized into three groups: I) both juveniles and adults are caught mainly by trawls II) juveniles of the species are caught in trawl, whereas <b>their</b> <b>adults</b> are targeted by gears other than trawl and III) juveniles of the species are caught by trawls regularly, but <b>their</b> <b>adults</b> are rarely caught or not figured in the fishery of the region.

5|$|Elves {{are born}} about one year from their {{conception}}. The {{day of their}} conception is celebrated, not the actual birthday itself. Their minds develop more quickly than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they really are. Physical puberty comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown.

5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form cr√®ches to keep warm and stay protected. Once <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E

5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> lives.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} (Connochaetes taurinus), {{also called}} the common wildebeest, white-bearded wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope {{and one of the}} two species of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black wildebeest. The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown, and begin to take on <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> colouration at the age of two months. The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch at night, and {{the larvae}} swim {{to the water}} surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage {{involves}} three moults and lasts for 15‚Äì35 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they {{are known to be}} capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> lives.|$|E

5|$|The {{suborder}} Cryptobranchoidea {{contains the}} primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, {{but there are}} only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in <b>their</b> <b>adult</b> state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries close to the surface.|$|E
