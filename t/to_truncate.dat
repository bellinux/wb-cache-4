The southernmost portion of the Lodge Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of BS I-375 from I-75 south.

5|$|The RTA, re-branded as Sound Transit, {{selected}} a preferred route {{for the light}} rail line in 1999. The northern terminus was to be located {{on the east side}} of 15th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 45th Street, and the line would travel south via a tunnel under Portage Bay towards Downtown Seattle and Rainier Valley, ending at the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Cost over-runs and withheld funding from the federal government led Sound Transit <b>to</b> <b>truncate</b> its initial light rail line to Downtown in 2001, with the segment north to the University District to be built at a later date.

5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the north–south highway through Pontiac was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. A number of highway designation and routing changes in the Pontiac were made when US10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown {{by the middle of}} 1961. Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake Roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Nine years later, US10 was moved off Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Detroit to follow the Lodge Freeway and Telegraph Road. Bus. US10 was extended westward along Square Lake Road from the intersection of Woodward Avenue to the junction with Telegraph Road so that it would continue to connect with its parent highway on the southern end. In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials <b>to</b> <b>truncate</b> US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus.

25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs of active faulting on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears <b>to</b> <b>truncate</b> strands of the Seattle Fault. In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E
500|$|With this {{extension}} the Utah {{definition of}} US163 conflicted with the AASHTO definition. UDOT resolved this discrepancy by signing the extended portion as State Route 163.

[...] Although the state changed the definition of US163 back to match the national definition in 2004, the portion north of Bluff remained unsigned.

2500|$|When Genie started forming longer sentences, {{she often}} {{produced}} extreme haplologies. She frequently omitted morphological elements which, though {{necessary to make}} the utterance grammatical, were clear to present observers, causing speculation that Genie had a grammar rule first mandating and then optionally permitting her to remove grammatical elements which were non-essential in context. At other times Genie condensed and deleted sounds, syllables, or entire words in ways which rendered her speech ambiguous, and for no discernible reason sometimes said the same sentence with and without any omissions. This significantly complicated attempts to determine Genie's true linguistic abilities, and researchers speculated this {{may have led to}} her comprehension scores being significantly lower on certain language analysis tests.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{standardize}} t‘ai-chi ch‘üan for wushu tournament judging, and because many tàijíquán teachers have either {{moved out of}} China or {{had been forced to}} stop teaching after the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the government sponsored the Chinese Sports Committee, who brought together four of their wushu teachers <b>to</b> <b>truncate</b> the Yang family hand form to 24 postures in 1956. They wanted to retain the look of tàijíquán, but create a routine that would be less difficult to teach and much less difficult to learn than longer (in general, 88 to 108 posture), classical, solo hand forms. In 1976, they developed a slightly longer form also for the purposes of demonstration that still would not involve the complete memory, balance, and coordination requirements of the traditional forms. This became the [...] "Combined 48 Forms" [...] that were created by three wushu coaches, headed by Men Hui Feng. The combined forms were created based on simplifying and combining some features of the classical forms from four of the original styles: Chen, Yang, Wu, and Sun. As tàijíquán again became popular on the mainland, more competitive forms were developed to be completed within a six-minute time limit. In the late 1980s, the Chinese Sports Committee standardized many different competition forms. They developed sets to represent the four major styles as well as combined forms. These five sets of forms were created by different teams, and later approved by a committee of wushu coaches in China. All sets of forms thus created were named after their style: the [...] "Chen-style national competition form" [...] is the [...] "56 Forms". The combined forms are [...] "The 42-Form" [...] or simply the [...] "Competition Form". Another modern form is the [...] "97 movements combined t‘ai-chi ch‘üan form", created in the 1950s; it contains characteristics of the Yang, Wu, Sun, Chen, and Fu styles blended into a combined form. The wushu coach Bow Sim Mark is a notable exponent of the [...] "67 combined form".|$|E
2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act <b>to</b> <b>truncate</b> the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E
