5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with <b>the</b> <b>fingertips,</b> and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanisms}} underlying vibration white finger (VWF) are not clear, {{it has been}} speculated that VWF is associated with variations of the blood flow patterns due to the physical damage and/or degeneration in neural and vascular tissue caused by vibration loading [1]. Excessive dynamic deformation of the soft tissues in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> under vibration loading is believed to induce multiple occupation-related hand/finger disorders. However, the in vivo distributions of the dynamic stress/strain of the tissues in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> under vibration conditions have not been studied because they cannot be measured experimentally to date. The goal {{of this study is}} to analyze, theoretically, the location and frequency-dependent dynamic deformation of the soft tissue in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> during vibration exposures. [] Methods <b>The</b> <b>fingertip</b> considered in <b>the</b> model is the distal phalanx, the portion from the distal end of <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> to <b>the</b> distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint articulation (Fig. 1). The external shape of <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> was determined using a smooth mathematical surface fitting to <b>the</b> observed <b>fingertip</b> shapes. <b>The</b> <b>fingertip</b> surface was then scaled to the dimensions of a typical male index finger: length 25 mm, width 20 mm, and height 18 mm. <b>The</b> <b>fingertip</b> was approximated to be symmetric, such that only a half of <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> was considered in the FE modeling. <b>The</b> <b>fingertip</b> was assumed to be composed of outer and inner skin layers, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and nail. The soft tissues (inner skin layer and subcutaneous tissues) were assumed to be nonlinearly elastic and viscoelastic, while the bone, nail, and outer skin layer were considered as linearly elastic. The simulations were conducted using a displacement-controlled protocol in two stages. First, <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> was statically pre-compressed. The contact plate was first displaced towards the finger to achieve a predetermined value of tissue deformation (i. e., 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 mm). Second, the steady-state dynamics responses of <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> were analyzed using a linear perturbation procedure. <b>The</b> <b>fingertip</b> was subjected to a continuous harmonic excitation (magnitude 0. 5 mm) from the contact interface. The dynamic analysis was performed in a frequency domain ranging from 16 to 2000 Hz. The frequency-dependent distributions of the vibration magnitude and dynamic strain magnitudes in the soft tissues are investigated. Results Typical simulation results for the frequency-dependent distributions of the vibration magnitude in the soft tissues are shown in Fig. 2 (figures show the results with a pre-compression of 2. 0 mm). The vibration magnitude at the contact surface is 0. 5 mm (specified) for all frequencies, while the vibration magnitudes in the soft tissues are location- and frequency-dependent. It is clear that <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> has a major resonance around 125 Hz, at which the vibration magnitudes in the soft tissues are over four times greater than that of the contact plate (0. 5 mm). It is interesting to observe that, at this resonant frequency (125 Hz), the soft tissues at the tip has the maximal vibration magnitude while the regions near the contac...|$|R
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between <b>the</b> <b>fingertips</b> generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E

40|$|We report two {{experiments}} in which non-informative {{vision of the}} finger enhanced tactile acuity on <b>the</b> <b>fingertip.</b> <b>The</b> right index finger was passively lifted to contact a grating. Twelve participants judged orientations of tactile gratings while viewing either <b>the</b> <b>fingertip,</b> or a neutral object presented via a mirror at <b>the</b> <b>fingertip's</b> location. In Expt. 1, tactile orientation discrimination for near-threshold gratings was improved when viewing <b>the</b> <b>fingertip,</b> compared to viewing the neutral object. Experiment 2 examined the temporal persistence of this effect, and found significant visual-tactile enhancement when a dark interval of up to 10 s intervened between viewing the finger and tactile stimulation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{finite element}} analyses to evaluate numerically and objectively the feelings in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> when opening aluminum beverage cans, {{in order to}} design {{the shape of the}} tab. Experiments of indenting vertically <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> pulp by a probe and by tabs of aluminum beverage can ends have allowed us to observe force responses and feelings in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip.</b> It was found that a typical force-displacement curve may be simplified as a combination of three curves with different gradients. Participants feel a touch at Curve 1 of the force-displacement curve, then feel a pressure and their pulse at Curve 2, finally feel discomfort followed by a pain in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> at Curve 3. Finite element analyses have been performed to simulate indenting the tab with <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> vertically to confirm that the simulation results agree well with the experimental observations. Finally, numerical simulations of the finger pulling up the tab of the can end has also been performed and discomfort in <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> has been related to the maximum value of the contact stress of the finger model. Comparisons of three designs of tab ring shape showed that the tab with a larger contact area with finger is better. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{constantly}} {{interact with}} objects by touching, displacing, or manipulating them, and tactile information from <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> skin is of primary importance in this process. The skin is a viscoelastic tissue that contains thousands of mechanoreceptors, which are stimulated by skin deformation and {{provide information about}} a touched surface or an object held. To optimally control arm movement or fingertip force during object manipulation, {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) integrates this tactile information. In this thesis, a « bottom-up » approach has been used to describe the link between skin mechanical properties and brain motor control of movement. Skin mechanical deformation at the interface between <b>the</b> <b>fingertip</b> and a glass surface and the effect of moisture content has been first addressed. The effect of interaction force components and moisture on the surface skin deformation has been analyzed and the results show that the moisture content can strongly influence skin properties. Then a task-specific instrument to measure skin moisture during object manipulation has been developed and the coefficient of friction at the interface between the fingers and an object held in precision grip has been studied.
