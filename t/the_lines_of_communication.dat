5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese to sever <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided {{to land the}} rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War the {{majority}} of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London {{was surrounded by a}} defensive perimeter wall known as <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication.</b> The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.|$|E

5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were {{driven out of}} Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process of}} being relieved, returned to the front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers back out of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 28 March, the Greek Central Macedonia Army Section—comprising the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions—were {{put under}} the command of General Wilson, who {{established}} his headquarters to the north-west of Larissa. The New Zealand division took position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and anti-aircraft guns and <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the Aegean Sea. These logistical problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{entered the}} war in 1761 as an ally of France. The British high command {{believed}} that capturing Havana would destroy <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> from Spain to its colonial empire. On June 6, the assaulting British forces arrived seven miles off the shore of Havana. The 17th Foot, including Montgomery's company, was to capture Moro Fort, {{the key to the}} Spanish defense of the city. British battleships bombarded the fort, silencing all but two Spanish guns. On July 30, Montgomery and the 17th Foot stormed and captured the fort. In late August 1762, Montgomery and the 17th Foot were sent to New York, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} war. The conflict was ended by the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.|$|E

5|$|As a result, castle {{building}} by the Norman nobility across England and the Marches lacked a grand strategic plan, reflecting local circumstances such as military factors and {{the layout of}} existing estates and church lands. Castles were often situated along the old Roman roads that still formed the backbone for travel across the country, both to control <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and to ensure easy movement between different estates. Many castles were built close to inland river ports and those built on the coast were usually located at the mouths of rivers or in ports, Pevensey and Portchester being rare exceptions. Some groups of castles were located {{so as to be}} mutually reinforcing – for example the castles of Littledean Camp, Glasshouse Woods and Howle Hill Camp were intended to act as an integrated defence for the area around Gloucester and Gloucester Castle for Gloucester city itself, while Windsor was one of a ring of castles built around London, each approximately a day's march apart. Some regional patterns in castle building can also be seen – relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of available serfs, or unfree labour.|$|E
5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, {{and whether or not}} it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve the actions of the badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 November, along with the 20th Battalion, it was tasked with the capture of Belhamed, a hill {{adjacent}} to Sidi Rezegh. With two companies leading the battalion's portion of the advance, the objective was captured with a bayonet charge. Peart was wounded during the attack but remained in command. The battalion held the hill {{for three days and}} then swapped its positions with the 20th Battalion before, on 30 November, the 15th Panzer Division surrounded and attacked Belhamed. While the 20th Battalion was effectively destroyed, the 18th Battalion, with Peart maintaining tight control of some personnel who were close to panicking, managed to evacuate in time and reached the British 70th Division in Tobruk. Here it manned the lines, with Gray back in command, fending off German attacks, until 11 December when it was withdrawn to Baggush.
