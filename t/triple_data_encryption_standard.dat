40|$|International audienceCryptographic {{algorithms}} {{are used}} to protect sensitive information from untrusted parties when the communication medium is not secure. Many secure systems such as smartcards include hardware implementation of symmetric cryptographic algorithms such as (<b>Triple)</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> and Advanced Encryption Standard. The secret keys used to encrypt the data with these algorithms are large enough to prevent any brute force attack that consists in exploring the whole solution space. However, the hardware implementation of these cryptographic algorithms allows the hackers to measure the observable characteristics of the physical implementation and deduce the secret key (side‐channel attacks). The key can even be discovered by applying a side‐channel attack on scan chains. These scan chains, which aim to provide full controllability and observability of internal states, represent nevertheless the most popular design‐for‐testability scheme. Because crypto‐processors and others cores in a secure system must pass through high‐quality test procedures to ensure that data are correctly processed, testing of crypto chips faces a dilemma: how to develop a design‐for‐testability scheme that provides high testability (high controllability and observability) while maintaining high security (minimal controllability and observability) ? This tutorial presents the security weaknesses generated by scan designs on hardware AES and DES implementations. It also discusses {{the pros and cons}} of security‐dedicated DFT, BIST and Fault tolerance solutions taken from the literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Data and {{information}} security are critical {{elements of the}} modern world. Relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as Microsoft 1 SQL Server are the backbone of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. With SQL Server 2008 Enterprise, Microsoft introduces Transparent Data Encryption (TDE); also known as whole database encryption, TDE secures complete database instances using industry standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and <b>Triple</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (TDES) encryption ciphers. Prior to Transparent Data Encryption, whole database encryption has been readily available for Microsoft SQL Server using Encryptionizer from NetLib. This paper details the methodology, results, and conclusions in comparing the performance of 128 -bit AES encrypted TDE and Encryptionizer SQL Server 2008 instances against a baseline, unencrypted instance. Benchmark data results were collected from virtual single processor systems using Virtual PC and VMware, and a non-virtual dual processor host system. The evaluation included ten separate benchmarks in five categories: data retrieval, insertion, update, deletion, and backup. All evaluations were conducted using SQL scripts executed using Microsoft Transact-SQL against a sample Northwind database expanded in data size {{by a factor of}} 100. Virtual single processor results yielded a slight performance advantage for Encryptionizer over Transparent Data Encryption, and a significant performance advantage for Encryptionizer over Transparent Data Encryption in the non-virtual dual processor configuration.

40|$|The current {{method of}} distributing Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys {{involves}} manual {{distribution of the}} same DES key in component form to all A TMs in a banks network. The components are entered into the ATM keyboard and combined to form the ATM Terminal Master Key (TMK) used for all ATM transactions. Public key cryptosystems {{can be used to}} distribute and manage A TM TMKs. However, existing cryptosystem implementations have numerous problems. Moreover, little research has targeted cryptosystem implementations that use tamper-resistant security modules (TRSMs). Almost all security attacks of cryptosystems utilizing security processors and cryptography are the result of weak implementation and deployment. This case study describes how a public key cryptosystem for distribution and management of A TM <b>Triple</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (3 DES) TMKs may be successfully implemented. This case study was developed to offer a repeatable approach, design, and implementation for a public key cryptosystem for A TM 3 DES TMK distribution and management. The study 2 ̆ 7 s design was based on a single case, using multiple sources of evidence and propositions. Using Toronto Dominion (TD) Bank as the unit of analysis, the study focuses on four main propositions relating to (a) system development processes (SDPs), (b) electronic data assurances, (c) key and certificate life cycle management, and (d) ATM key hierarchies. Results of the study show that SDPs provided a general framework for system development and were not tailored to specific needs of an A TM cryptosystem. Evidence shows that the ATM public key cryptosystem met all CAIN digital assurance and ATM key hierarchy requirements but did not meet all key and certificate life cycle requirements. The author recommends a modified SDP framework for A TM public key cryptosystems called cryptosystem SDPs. These consist of SDPs, an integration of A TM cryptosystem requirements, and software security best practices. This framework utilizes existing SDPs but adds four new phases to take into account ATM public key cryptosystem requirements...|$|E

40|$|With so many {{security}} issues involved with wireless networks, {{the technology has}} not been fully utilized {{in the area of}} mission critical applications. These applications would include the areas of telemetry, commanding, voice and video. Wireless networking would allow payload operators the mobility to take computers outside of the control room to their off ices and anywhere else in the facility that the wireless network was extended. But the risk is too great of having someone sit just inside of your wireless network coverage and intercept enough of your network traffic to steal proprietary data from a payload experiment or worse yet hack back into your system and do even greater harm by issuing harmful commands. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is improving but has a ways to go before it can be trusted to protect mission critical data. Today s hackers are becoming more aggressive and innovative, and in order {{to take advantage of the}} benefits that wireless networking offer, appropriate security measures need to be in place that will thwart hackers. The Virtual Private Network (VPN) offers a solution to the security problems that have kept wireless networks from being used for mission critical applications. VPN provides a level of encryption that will ensure that data is protected while it is being transmitted over a wireless local area network (LAN). The VPN allows a user to authenticate to the site that the user needs to access. Once this authentication has taken place the network traffic between that site and the user is encapsulated in VPN packets with the <b>Triple</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (3 DES). 3 DES is an encryption standard that uses a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. The length of the encryption key is 168 bits as opposed to its predecessor DES that has a 56 -bit encryption key. Even though 3 DES is the common encryption standard for today, the Advance Encryption Standard (AES), which provides even better encryption at a lower cycle cost is growing acceptance. The user computer running the VPN client and the target site that is running the VPN firewall exchange this encryption key and therefore are the only ones that are able to decipher the data. The level of encryption offered by the VPN is making it possible for wireless networks to pass the strict security policies that have kept them from being used in the past. Now people will be able to benefit from the many advantages that wireless networking has to offer in the area of mission critical applications...|$|E
40|$|The IEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} specifies the {{air interface}} of the fixed {{broadband wireless access}} (BWA) including the Media Access Control (MAC) layer supporting primarily Point to Multi Point PMP and optional MESH mode. The MAC is structured to support multiple physical specifications, each suits a different operational band. For 10 - 66 a direct line of sight is required between the BS and the Costumer Premises Equipment CPE with a single carrier. For the band lower than the 11 GHz, near line of sight or non line of sight is enough using three physical layer specifications: single carrier,OFDM, OFDMA. The MAC layer consists of three sublayers : the Convergence Sublayer {{which is responsible for}} mapping the different services to the specific MAC service data units (SDUs). The Common Part Sublayer is core of the MAC layer. It is responsible for packet scheduling according to the QoS requirements. The lowest sublayer is the Security Sublayer which is responsible for the key exchange and encryption. The standard revises are the IEEE 802. 16, IEEE 802. 16 a,IEEE 802. 16 c and IEEE 802. 16 d. This project simulates and evaluate IEEE 802. 16 a concentrating on the physical layer and the three MAC sublayers using the point to multipoint access, the OFDM mode which is suitable for the license exempt bands. The Encryption algorithm used is the double keys <b>triple</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (DES) with, EBC mode,FIPS 81. Assuming packet by packet processing, a 128 bytes packet needs 16 rounds of encryption using the same keys. MATLAB version 7 simulation was built {{for the sake of the}} performance analysis. All mandatory blocks in the IEEE 802. 16 a specification are included : Scheduler, Encryption, randomizer, Forward Error Correction (FEC) which includes Reed Solomon encoder, Convolutional Encoder, Interleaver and the Mapper, OFDM was simulated using 256 FFT. The channel was assumed to be Rican channel,the channel estimator. To enhance the BER, diversity technique with maximal ration combining is also simulated. The rate ID was chosen according to the SNR,and the number of packets that can be sent in one time slot are 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 packets as the rate ID increases. The so called the Unsolicited Grant Services are assigned a constant number of time slots. The scheduler chooses the connection having the highest priority function which is determined by the type of the connection and the ii state of the channel. If the satisfaction delay in the case of the real time services and the rate satisfaction in the case of the non real time services is not satisfied, the priority function is set to the maximum value. A desirable property of any encryption algorithm is that a small change in either the plain text or the key produces significant change in the cipher text. In particular, a change in one bit of the plain text or one bit in the key should produce a change in many bits of the cipher text. Avalanche effect test shows a change in a single bit produces difference in about half the ciphered block. The diversity results shows that the BER is enhanced dramatically by using the diversity technique. The BER is also increased as the Rate ID increases. However, when the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) is used,the BER is set to the prescribed value 10 - 1. The results shows that CP also enhances the BER performance...|$|E
