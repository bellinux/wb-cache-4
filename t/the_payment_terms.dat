5000|$|In their {{decision}} in Makdessi the Supreme Court reviewed the historical {{origins of the}} rule against penalty clauses in contracts. [...] The law originated {{in the fifteenth century}} in relation to [...] "defeasible bonds" [...] (sometimes called penal bonds) which were a contractual promise to pay money, which might be discharged if certain obligations were performed (and if the obligations were not performed, then <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>terms</b> under the bond could be enforced). [...] However the courts of equity regarded these as what they really were - security for performance of the underlying obligation - and were prepared to restrain enforcement of such bonds where the defaulting party paid any damages due at common law. [...] In time the courts of common law began to mirror this approach and stay any proceedings on such bonds where the defendant gave an undertaking to pay damages together with interest and costs. The position of the common law courts was adopted and codified in the Administration of Justice Act 1696 and later the Administration of Justice Act 1705. Accordingly, procedurally relief in relation to such bonds was thereafter administered entirely by the common law courts without intervention by the courts of equity. However, the courts of equity began to develop concurrent remedies for relief from forfeiture. With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics became increasingly applied to liquidated damages clauses.|$|E

40|$|There has {{recently}} been renewed focus on the role that collective action clauses (CACs) could play in facilitating the resolution of sovereign debt problems. The most important such clause is the majority restructuring clause, by which a qualified majority of bondholders can vote to alter <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>terms</b> of the bond and make these changes binding even for dissenting bondholders. In this note, we investigate the actual contractual terms of a large sample of bonds issued into the Euromarket by emerging market sovereigns.

In each case the legal adviser was the London office of a US law firm, helping produce this unusual combination of English and American legal practice.

Adding flexibility to the contracts refines these results. First, buy out contracts allow to grant launch control to the marketer while still launching all profitable outcomes. Second, allowing the parties to renegotiate the contract after observing the outcome of the research phase further increases the contract value and can often achieve first-best...|$|E

40|$|The {{external}} debt of emerging market sovereign borrowers is now {{mainly in the}} form of bonds held by numerous institutional and individual bondholders. Many of these bonds are governed by the law of the state of New York. As a matter of drafting convention, bonds for sovereign issuers governed by New York law prohibit amendments to <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>terms</b> of the instruments (the amount and the due dates of payments) without the consent of each affected bondholder. If a sovereign issuer finds it necessary to seek a restructuring of its bond indebtedness, it must therefore implement the restructuring by offering to exchange its old bonds for new debt instruments that reflect the new financial terms; a technique that inevitably risks leaving behind 2 ̆ 2 holdout 2 ̆ 2 creditors who may refuse to accept the proposed restructuring. Holdouts pose a litigation threat to the sovereign and may even jeopardize the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s ability to service the new bonds it has issued to the other creditors participating in the exchange. A number of ideas - ranging from international bankruptcy codes and stays of creditor legal remedies administered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to reforming the explicit terms of sovereign bond contracts - have been suggested as a means of dealing with the holdout creditor threat. This article suggests a less radical, and more immediately applicable, alternative; allowing the majority creditors to use the amendment clauses in their existing bonds to change certain nonpayment terms contained in those bonds (such as financial covenants or waivers of sovereign immunity) as a means of encouraging prospective holdouts to participate in the exchange. Because the sovereign issuer solicits the consent of its creditors to amend the old bonds just as those lenders exchange their bonds for the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s new debt instruments, this techinque is referred to as an 2 ̆ 2 exit 2 ̆ 2 consent...|$|E
40|$|The main {{research}} problem {{addressed in this}} study was to determine the key factors required by purchasing and supply departments in the automotive manufacturing industry to be efficient and effective. To achieve this objective, it was necessary to identify five sub-objectives which were, firstly, to determine the extent to which the purchasing and supply departments in the automotive industry believe that certain key factors in pricing, quality and supplier management are required to achieve excellence. Secondly, to identify if the purchasing and supply departments in the automotive industry actually implement the key factors on pricing, quality and supplier management in practice. Thirdly, to determine if there are any additional factors other than these key factors that business firms regard as key factors to be classified as worldclass purchasing and supply departments. Fourthly, to analyse why purchasing and supply departments in the automotive manufacturing industry do not always implement these key factors. Lastly, to identify any other factors that could have a significant negative impact on the performance of purchasing and supply departments. The study commenced with an analysis and review of relevant literature from various text books, journals, publications and internet sources. The literature study covered issues such as price determination, cost management, basic negotiation strategies, managing supplier quality and the supplier base, as well as a general overview of the latest developments in purchasing and supply management in business. The purpose of the literature analysis was to establish a theoretical basis for the design of the questionnaire which was used as a research instrument in this study. A survey was conducted among selected automotive assemblers and their first and second tier manufacturing suppliers in the automotive industry. The main areas of focus in the questionnaire were pricing, quality, and supplier management. As the questions in the questionnaire related to the purchasing and supply department of a business firm, a qualified and experienced buyer in the purchasing and supply department was identified in each firm to complete the questionnaire. The empirical results from the study conducted indicated that the respondents were in strong agreement with the proposed importance of the factors of pricing, quality, and supplier management required to achieve xcellence. However, the respondents also indicated that there were various obstacles which prevented the firms from implementing these key factors. Some of the obstacles mentioned were long lead times, late deliveries from suppliers, too few competitors in the market place, supplier capacity constraints and the sustainability of suppliers. Additional obstacles that the study identified were the high workload of buyers in general, incompetent staff and insufficient manpower that affected the performance of a purchasing and supply department. The buyers were not only performing buying activities, but were also involved in logistics related activities, which increased their workload and negatively affected their performance. Lack of specialised purchasing and supply chain knowledge was identified as another obstacle to achieving excellence. The empirical study highlighted some recommendations to assist purchasing and supply departments in the automotive industry to achieve excellence and become world-class departments. Examples of these recommendations are that suppliers need to be educated on how to understand their costing models and to check their own sustainability; local purchasing and supply departments require training in the purchasing skills such as incoterms, delivery times, minimum and maximum order quantity; as well as <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>terms.</b> Buyers should be trained to become experts in their products and packaging, as well as the manufacturing process of the product they are purchasing The business firm should only employ qualified buyers who have financial and administrative skills, as well as the ability to adapt to change and work in teams. Buyers also need to master the in-house systems and work procedures involved in purchasing a product. The empirical study also identified that the majority of buyers in the automotive manufacturing industry are senior buyers, male in gender and between the ages of 40 - 49. The implementation of the recommendations based on the study’s empirical findings will assist in improved pricing, quality and supply management in the automotive manufacturing industry...|$|E
