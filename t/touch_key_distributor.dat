40|$|Mobile phones with a {{touch screen}} {{replacing}} traditional keypads have been introduced to the market. Few studies, however, have been conducted on the touch interface design for a mobile phone. This study investigated the effects of <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes and locations on the one-handed thumb input that is popular in mobile phone interactions. Three different <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes (i. e. square shape with 4 mm, 7 mm, and 10 mm wide) and twenty five locations were examined in an experiment. The results provided two groups of <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> locations (an appropriate and an inappropriate region) with respect to three usability measures including success rate, number of errors, and pressing convenience. In addition, a hits distributions based algorithm was applied to target selection tasks, which statistically improved the performance. The {{results of this study}} could be used to design <b>touch</b> <b>keys</b> so as to enhance the usability of mobile phones {{with a touch}} screen...|$|R

40|$|People tend to {{use their}} {{smartphones}} one-handed, which is unergonomic for the human musculoskeletal system. Stretching the thumb to reach certain <b>touch</b> <b>keys</b> is uncomfortable. Especially now that smartphones have large screens, normally ranging from 4. 5 ” and above. Exaggerated use of smartphones can lead to repetitive strain injury (RSI), which is caused by static, repetitive movements over an extended time. This master thesis investigates how different <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> locations and <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes affect the ergonomics of user interfaces on large smartphones. Moreover, it examines if {{the principles of the}} functional area improve the ergonomics of mobile user interfaces. The functional area is the surface of the touchscreen that is reachable by the thumb. Expert interviews were used to collect data to make hypotheses regarding improving the ergonomics of mobile user interfaces for one-handed interaction. An electromyography (EMG) test was conducted to investigate the hypotheses. EMG is a technology used to measure muscle contractions. The results show a significant correlation between a user interface that applies the functional area and a decline in muscle contraction. However, the decline in muscle contraction only occurs if the functional area is designed specifically for the user’s dominant hand. There {{were no significant differences between}} the <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes and the extent of muscle contraction. The findings from this master thesis support the idea that the functional area and changes in the user interface design affect the ergonomics of smartphone interaction...|$|R

40|$|Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) is a {{promising}} cryptographic primitive which enables fine-grained access control over sensitive data. However, key abuse attacks in KP-ABE may impede its wide application especially in copyright-sensitive systems. To defend against {{this kind of}} attacks, this paper proposes a novel KP-ABE scheme which is able to disclose any illegal <b>key</b> <b>distributor’s</b> ID when <b>key</b> abuse is detected. In our scheme, each bit of user ID is defined as an attribute and the user secret key is associated with his unique ID. The tracing algorithm fulfills its task by tricking the pirate device into decrypting the ciphertext associated with the corresponding bits of his ID. Our proposed scheme has the salient property of black box tracing, i. e., it traces back to the illegal <b>key</b> <b>distributor’s</b> ID only by observing the pirate device’s outputs on certain inputs. In addition, {{it does not require}} the pirate device’s secret keys to be well-formed as compared to some previous work. Our proposed scheme is provably secure under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and the Decisional Linear (DL) assumption...|$|R

40|$|YesAddressing key {{management}} in mobile multicast communication {{is currently a}} booming topic due to the convergence of wireless and mobile technologies. With the proliferation of multiple group based services that are possible to co-exist within a single network, mobile subscribers could subscribe to these services concurrently while ubiquitous. However, the existing group {{key management}} (GKM) protocols intend to secure group communication for just a single group service. The GKM approaches involve inefficient use of keys and huge rekeying overheads, hence unsuitable for multiple multicast group environments. In this paper, we propose a novel GKM protocol for multiple multicast groups, called slot based multiple group key management (SMGKM) scheme. SMGKM supports the movement of single and multiple members across a homogeneous or heterogeneous wireless network while participating in multiple group services with minimized rekeying transmission overheads. Unlike conventional GKM protocols, SMGKM protocol can mitigate 1 -affect-n phenomenon, {{single point of failure}} and investment pressure of signaling load caused by rekeying at the core network. Numerical analysis and simulation results of the proposed protocol show significant resource economy in terms of communication bandwidth overhead, storage overheads at the Domain <b>Key</b> <b>Distributor</b> (DKD), mobile receiver and Area <b>Key</b> <b>Distributors</b> while providing intense security...|$|R

30|$|S-ARP [9] is {{a popular}} cryptography-based approach. Although S-ARP {{requests}} operate {{in the same way}} as normal ARP requests, S-ARP replies need to be signed by the sender's private key and the signature needs to be verified using the sender's public key at the receiver side. Since S-ARP is based on asymmetric cryptography, it requires a central server called authoritative <b>key</b> <b>distributor</b> (AKD) to manage the mapping between the IP address and the corresponding public key. If the AKD fails, the whole system may not work, i.e., S-ARP has a single point of failure problem. In addition, S-ARP usually requires the upgrade of the DHCP server and incremental deployment is not easy, since the S-ARP-enabled machine may not accept ARP replies from non-S-ARP nodes.|$|R
