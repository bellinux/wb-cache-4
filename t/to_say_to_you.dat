5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, Avi Arad {{revealed}} a Venom spin-off {{was in the}} works. The studio commissioned Jacob Aaron Estes to write a script, but rejected it the following year. In September 2008, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese signed on to write. Stan Lee signed on to make a cameo in the film. Rhett Reese later revealed that they had written two drafts for the film and that the studio was pushing the film forward. In 2009, Gary Ross, who was then rewriting the latest draft of the unproduced Spider-Man 4, was assigned to rewrite the Venom script and direct the film, in which Venom would be an antihero rather than a supervillain. In March 2012, Chronicle director Josh Trank negotiated with Sony about his interest in directing the film after Ross left development to direct The Hunger Games. In June 2012, The Amazing Spider-Man producer Matt Tolmach, speaking of his and fellow producer Avi Arad's next project, a Venom film, suggested it could follow the shared-universe model of the film The Avengers: [...] "What I'm trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> without giving anything away is hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Jackson's brother Michael {{died at age}} fifty. She spoke {{publicly}} {{concerning his}} death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating [...] "I'd just like <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live {{in all of our}} hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much." [...] In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming Why Did I Get Married Too?. Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, [...] "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second." [...] During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet [...] "Scream". MTV stated [...] "there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] The performance was lauded by critics, with Entertainment Weekly affirming the rendition [...] "as energetic as it was heartfelt".|$|E

2500|$|The {{bodies were}} {{returned}} to Acteal {{a few days later}} for a Christmas Day funeral ceremony, presided over by Bishop Samuel Ruiz. [...] Bishop Ruiz, profoundly affected by the massacre, told those at the funeral: [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> we are keeping you company on this Christmas Day, the saddest Christmas Day of our lives... And we ask our Father Jesus that you remain faithful in your hearts to his word, and that you do not stumble on the stone of temptation of hatred and violence." ...|$|E

[...] After delivering the speech, King and the marchers approached the entrance to the capitol with a petition for Governor Wallace. A line of state troopers blocked the door. One announced that the governor was not in. Undeterred, the marchers remained at the entrance until one of Wallace's secretaries appeared and took the petition.|$|E
2500|$|When Mandisa {{presented}} {{herself to}} the judges prior to the final cut-down to the season's 24 semi-finalists, she told Cowell: [...] "What I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> is that, yes, you hurt me and I cried and it was painful, it really was. But I {{want you to know}} that I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, I can certainly extend that same grace to you." [...] Cowell told Mandisa that he was [...] "humbled" [...] and apologized to her immediately.|$|E

It's true that you've survived a long season in hell, but, when all's said and done, it was a hell you knew. What's heading your way, now, comrades, is a hell that you have not experienced at all: the hell of the show, the alienating hell of TV sets.
