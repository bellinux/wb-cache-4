5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E
5|$|Buscetta {{claimed that}} Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{organized}} De Mauro’s kidnap, because his {{investigations into the}} death of Mattei {{came very close to}} the Mafia, and Bontade’s own role in the affair. Another pentito, Francesco Di Carlo, declared in 2001 that De Mauro was killed because he had learned that one of his former fascist friends, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, was planning a coup d'état (the so-called Golpe Borghese) with like-minded army officers determined <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> they considered as Italy's drift to the left. Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010, said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the prime}} universe, Nina Sharp helps {{to set up}} Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is the only option. Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news. She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> is already happening.|$|E

25|$|The {{children}} {{find out}} that in Constance’s time they kill seals for their oil. They become angered by this because this is why there are none left in their time. The children try to persuade a seal trapper that {{what he is doing}} is wrong, and <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> he is doing. Mandy finds a sick seal pup and decided the only way to save the pup is to take it through the mirror, but trouble ensues.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 825, Niu Sengru {{was still}} serving as chancellor, {{but he was}} feeling {{powerless}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> he saw as Emperor Jingzong's frivolousness and poor governance. He asked to be sent out of the capital. Emperor Jingzong made him the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Ezhou, Hubei). Also, that year after Emperor Jingzong declared a general pardon, Li Fengji submitted a proposed edict announcing the general pardon that would permit those exiled officials who had previously received a movement toward Chang'an be given another one, but not stating anything with regard to those exiled officials who had never received a previous movement toward Chang'an. Wei pointed out that this wording was intended by Li Fengji to prevent Li Shen's movement toward Chang'an. At Wei's suggestion, the edict was revised, allowing Li Shen to be moved to Jiang Prefecture (江州, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to serve as its secretary general.|$|E

500|$|During 2006 and {{the first}} half of 2007, {{students}} and mosque leaders continued to challenge the Pakistani government's authority by calling for Islamic law and to end co-operation with the United States. They launched an anti-vice campaign, kidnapping alleged prostitutes and burning films. Students at the Red Mosque's two affiliated seminaries launched a campaign for Shari'a, occupying a nearby children's library and embarking on vigilante raids through the capital <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> they called [...] "un-Islamic activities," [...] such as DVD vendors, barber shops and a Chinese-run massage parlor that they accused of being a brothel.|$|E

United States State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that the US was [...] "very concerned by recent violence surrounding protests" [...] of the 14th and 15th. In a 15 February appeal, Amnesty International called the Bahraini authorities to stop using what it called [...] "excessive force" [...] against protesters, to put all security forces' members who had used excessive force on trial and [...] "to respect and protect the right of freedom expression, movement and assembly in Bahrain".|$|E

500|$|Wilders has campaigned <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> {{he views}} as the [...] "Islamisation of the Netherlands". He has {{compared}} the Quran to Mein Kampf and has campaigned {{to have the}} book banned in the Netherlands. He advocates ending immigration from Muslim countries, and supports banning {{the construction of new}} mosques. Wilders was a speaker at the Facing Jihad Conference held in Israel in 2008, which discussed the dangers of jihad, and has called for a hard line against what he called [...] "street terror" [...] exerted by minorities in Dutch cities. His controversial 2008 film featuring his views on Islam, Fitna, received international attention and extreme criticism. His party was also sued due to content being used in his film without permission. He has been described in the media as populist and labeled far-right, although this is disputed by other observers. Wilders, who long refused to align himself with European far-right leaders such as Jean-Marie Le Pen and Jörg Haider and expressed concern about being [...] "linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups", views himself as a right-wing liberal. More recently, however, Wilders worked together with the French National Front's Marine Le Pen in an initially ill-fated, but eventually successful attempt to form a parliamentary group in the European Parliament which now includes parties from nine countries, among them Austria's Freedom Party, Italy's Northern League, and Belgium's Flemish Interest.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{guards were}} {{referred}} to by POWs as [...] "Goons" [...] and, unaware of the Allied connotation, willingly accepted the nickname after being told it stood for [...] "German Officer Or Non-Com". German guards were followed everywhere they went by prisoners, who used an elaborate system of signals to warn others of their location. The guards' movements were then carefully recorded in a logbook kept by a rota of officers. Unable <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> the prisoners called the [...] "Duty Pilot" [...] system, the Germans allowed it to continue and on one occasion the book was used by Kommandant von Lindeiner to bring charges against two guards who had slunk away from duty several hours early.|$|E

2500|$|Milliken at III Corps had {{previously}} ordered Leonard to direct Combat Command A of the 9th AID {{south on the}} west bank of the Rhine, across the Ahr River, and connect with Patton's Third Army. Hoge did not have orders to cross or capture the bridge, but he decided to disobey his orders and reroute those forces across the bridge to reinforce the bridgehead instead. With some forces already on the bridge, Hoge got new orders <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> he was doing and move his unit south to Koblenz. Hoge waited for a platoon to reach the far bank, hoping the bridge would stand, and then called 9th Armored Division commander Maj. Gen. John W. Leonard to inform him the bridge had been captured. If his gamble failed, Hoge risked a court-martial. He later described his feelings in that moment: ...|$|E

Mars was once very wet—it had oceans and lakes. Did life start on Mars and get flung into space and we are all descendants of Martian microbes? It's not crazy, and it's worth finding out. It's worth the cost of a cup of coffee per taxpayer every 10 years or 13 years to find out.” [...] Nye also endorsed a Mars sample-return role, saying “The amount of information you can get from a sample returned from Mars is believed to be extraordinarily fantastic and world-changing and worthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, {{a violent}} {{terrorist}} {{group known as}} the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) was formed {{in an effort to}} attain Quebec independence. In October 1970, their activities culminated in events referred to as the October Crisis when the British Trade commissioner James Cross was kidnapped along with Pierre Laporte, a provincial minister and Vice-Premier, who was killed a few days later. Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called for military assistance to guard government officials. Prime Minister Trudeau responded by declaring the War Measures Act <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>what</b> was described as an [...] "Apprehended Insurrection" [...] by the FLQ. Critics charge that Trudeau violated civil liberties by arresting thousands of political activists without a warrant as allowed by the Act. Supporters of these measures point to their popularity at the time, {{and the fact that the}} FLQ was wiped out. Independence-minded Quebecers would now opt for the social democratic nationalism of the Parti Québécois.|$|E
