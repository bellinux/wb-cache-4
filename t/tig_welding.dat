5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>welding,</b> is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E

25|$|Lugged {{steel frame}} can be {{repaired}} {{more easily than}} MIG or <b>TIG</b> <b>welded</b> steel frames; a broken tube can be removed by the application of heat to un-braze (known as sweating) its joints, enabling tube replacement.|$|R
2500|$|A more {{economical}} method of bicycle frame construction uses cylindrical steel tubing connected by <b>TIG</b> <b>welding,</b> {{which does not}} require lugs to hold the tubes together. [...] Instead, frame tubes are precisely aligned into a jig and fixed in place until the welding is complete. [...] Fillet brazing is another method of joining frame tubes without lugs. It is more labor-intensive, and consequently {{is less likely to}} be used for production frames. As with <b>TIG</b> <b>welding,</b> Fillet frame tubes are precisely notched or mitered and then a fillet of brass is brazed onto the joint, similar to the lugged construction process. A fillet braze frame can achieve more aesthetic unity (smooth curved appearance) than a welded frame.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} type of {{construction}} today uses aluminum alloy tubes that are connected together by Tungsten Inert Gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>welding.</b> [...] Welded aluminum bicycle frames started {{to appear in the}} marketplace only after this type of welding became economical in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Lugged {{steel frame}} {{construction}} is a method of building bicycle frames using steel tubing mated with socket-like sleeves, called lugs. [...] For most of the bicycle's history, steel has been the primary material for bicycle frames, with lugged construction the primary assembling method. [...] Steel continues in use by builders of high-quality steel frames, though its dominance as a frame material has waned since the mid-1990s displaced largely by aluminum and carbon fiber; lugging has been displaced by <b>TIG</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Tungsten and its alloys {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where high temperatures are present but still a high strength is necessary and the high density is not troublesome. Tungsten wire filaments provide {{the vast majority of}} household incandescent lighting, but are also common in industrial lighting as electrodes in arc lamps. Lamps get more efficient in the conversion of electric energy to light with higher temperatures and therefore a high melting point is essential for the application as filament in incandescent light. [...] Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW, also known as tungsten inert gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>welding)</b> equipment uses a permanent, non-melting electrode.

2500|$|One {{of these}} {{projects}} was the re-creation of the Tatra T.101 by twins Ivo and Jiří Sklenář. In the early 2000s, they started researching the aircraft and discovered that the blueprints had escaped destruction. They were discovered in the state archive at Opava. A Tatra HM-504 and a Tatra T100 engine were acquired {{with the assistance of}} Tatra and the Vyzkummy a Zkusebni Ustav (...) [...] These two engines were rebuilt and made into an airworthy T100 engine with the assistance of Tatra and the Národní Techniké Muzeum (...)

2500|$|The devices {{lanthanide}} {{elements are}} used in include superconductors, samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron high-flux rare-earth magnets, magnesium alloys, electronic polishers, refining catalysts and hybrid car components (primarily batteries and magnets). Lanthanide ions are used as the active ions in luminescent materials used in optoelectronics applications, most notably the [...] laser. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are significant devices in optical-fiber communication systems. Phosphors with lanthanide dopants are also widely used in cathode ray tube technology such as television sets. The earliest color television CRTs had a poor-quality red; europium as a phosphor dopant made good red phosphors possible. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres can act as tunable microwave resonators. Lanthanide oxides are mixed with tungsten to improve their high temperature properties for <b>TIG</b> <b>welding,</b> replacing thorium, which was mildly hazardous to work with. Many defense-related products also use lanthanide elements such as night vision goggles and rangefinders.

40|$|In this work, the {{mechanical}} properties of Waspaloy superalloy {{have been evaluated}} in case of welded repaired material and compared to base material. Test program considered flat specimens on base and <b>TIG</b> <b>welded</b> material subjected to static, low-cycle fatigue and creep test at different temperatures. Results of uniaxial tensile tests showed {{that the presence of}} welded material in the gage length specimen does not have a relevant influence on yield strength and UTS. However, elongation at failure of TIG material was reduced with respect to the base material. Moreover, low-cycle fatigue properties have been determined carrying out tests at different temperature (room temperature RT and 538 °C) in both base and <b>TIG</b> <b>welded</b> material. Welded material showed an increase of the data scatter and lower fatigue strength, which was anyway not excessive in comparison with base material. During test, all the hysteresis cycles were recorded in order to evaluate the trend of elastic modulus and hysteresis area against the number of cycles. A clear correlation between hysteresis and fatigue life was found. Finally, creep test carried out on a limited number of specimens allowed establishing some changes about the creep rate and time to failure of base and <b>welded</b> material. <b>TIG</b> <b>welded</b> specimen showed a lower time to reach a fixed strain or failure when a low stress level is applied.

40|$|The weld {{quality of}} {{tungsten}} inert gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>welded</b> joint has been investigated to identify the most economical weld parameters that will bring about optimum properties.

40|$|To emulate {{combined}} welding and brazing techniques, {{frequently used}} during the rejuvenation of turbine components, <b>TIG</b> and SWET <b>weld</b> overlays have been applied to the surfaces of a single crystal nickel-based alloy and subsequently overlain with braze and subjected to a typical brazing cycle heat treatment. Both welds comprised of columnar dendritic microstructures with an epitaxial [001] growth orientation near the substrate surface and equiaxed randomly oriented grains at the weld surface. While the <b>TIG</b> <b>weld</b> showed a sharp columnar to equiaxed transition, that for the SWET weld was diffuse and comprised colonies of columnar structures with their [001] misoriented to the epitaxial columnar directions {{as a result of}} shallower temperature gradients. Analysis of the microstructures of the brazed materials showed that the extents of boron penetration were significantly greater for the welds due to enhanced diffusion along grain boundaries between the equiaxed structures compared to y channel limited transport in the single crystal. A striking feature of the diffusion zone microstructures was the development of carbo-boride needles which formed by the reaction of boron, refractory metals and TaC. It is the release of Ta from TaC which stabilises y’ envelope formation around the needles. The post-brazed microstructures of <b>TIG</b> <b>welds</b> used in this study showed considerably fewer detrimental boride precipitates than brazed SWET welds and as a result are expected to show superior mechanical properties...|$|R
