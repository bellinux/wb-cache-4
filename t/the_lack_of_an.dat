The flag made its first official appearance on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.|$|E
5|$|Ng, {{who is a}} stay at home mother, {{writes in}} her spare time at home. Her topics are {{different}} depending on the genre she is writing in; her adult-oriented works often deal with minority groups, while her children's books are meant to teach empathy. Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group. However, some educators have protested <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explicit moral message in her children's books.|$|E

A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed upstairs in the Workshop, while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs.

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, {{construction}} was progressing {{on the western}} quadrant between I-15 in Murray and SR-201 (at the time US-40A/US-50A). Land acquisition was also taking place {{for the rest of}} the southeastern quadrant between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay. However, a citizens' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right-of-way acquirements due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental impact statement (EIS). Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East. By mid-1975, an EIS was released with four main alternatives: a no-build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast quadrant, building the road along the modern-day path (at about 6400 South), moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South, or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South. Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS. Meanwhile, I-215 from SR-201 in the western quadrant to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976.|$|E

5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars {{received}} generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered cinematics, {{attention to}} detail in replicating the Halo universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints against the game included <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode {{as well as the}} lack of strategic options during play. Critics from GameSpot and USA Today wrote that experienced RTS players would find the strategic elements of the title shallow. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009, making it the best-selling console real-time strategy game to date. An enhanced version of the game—Halo Wars: Definitive Edition—was released for Windows and Xbox One. Halo Wars 2, a sequel developed by 343 Industries and Creative Assembly was released in February 2017.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ATC system {{on most of}} Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Barcelona {{were drawn}} against their fellow leading-scorers in the competition, Bayern Munich, who had beaten Barcelona's group stage opposition, Sporting CP, 12–1 on {{aggregate}} {{in the previous}} round. However, despite Bayern's impressive scoring record, goals from Messi and Eto'o gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead within the first 12minutes. Messi and Henry also scored to seal a 4–0 home victory before half-time. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> away goal meant Bayern Munich would have to win by five clear goals {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. After a goalless first half, they took the lead through Franck Ribéry in the 47thminute, but it was not enough for Bayern as Keita equalised in the 73rdminute to clinch a 5–1 aggregate win for the Spanish side.|$|E

He also reasoned that the drag of the pod would both degrade the performance characteristics of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E
