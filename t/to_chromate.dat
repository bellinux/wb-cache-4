40|$|ABSTRACT: Cr(VI) (chromate) is a widespread, toxic and soluble {{environmental}} contaminant. Bacteria {{can reduce}} <b>chromate</b> <b>to</b> insoluble and less toxic Cr(III), and thus chromate bioremediation is of interest. Genetic and protein engineering of suitable enzymes can improve bacterial bioremediation. However, many fundamental parameters that define an organism’s capacity <b>to</b> remediate <b>chromate</b> have not previously been characterized. We have measured the innate {{ability of a}} wide range of bacteria <b>to</b> reduce <b>chromate.</b> All bacteria that we tested were able to reduce Cr(VI) through to stable Cr(III) end-products. One of these, Pseudomonas putida MK 1, is a promising candidate for chromate bioremediation, and we show that chromate transformation per mass unit increases in these cells as the environmental chromate concentration rises. However, bacterial growth is inhibited by chromate concentrations above 0. 8 mM. Furthermore, although cell extracts show increased chromate reductase activity under slow-growth conditions (mimicking nutrient-limited field conditions), the ability of the whole cells <b>to</b> transform <b>chromate</b> is greatly diminished. Chromate reduction by both whole cells and purified ChrR (a P. putida chromate reductase) is also inhibited by co-pollutants of chromate-contaminated sites. Thus, these studies identify several potential areas of improvement for generation of improved chromate-remediating bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Mutants of Neurospora {{resistant}} <b>to</b> <b>chromate</b> {{were selected}} {{and all were}} found to map at a single genetic locus designated as cys- 13. The chromate-resistant mutants grow at a wild-type rate on minimal media but are partially deficient in the transport of inorganic sulfate, especially during the conidial stage. An unlinked mutant, cys- 14, is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>chromate</b> but transports sulfate during the mycelial stage at only 25 % of the wild-type rate; cys- 14 also grows at a fully wild-type rate on minimal media. The double-mutant strain, cys- 13;cys- 14, cannot utilize inorganic sulfate for growth and completely lacks the capacity to transport this anion. The only biochemical lesion that has been detected for the double-mutant strain is its loss in capacity for sulfate transport. Neurospora appears to possess two distinct sulfate permease species encoded by separate genetic loci.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the yeast Pichia guilliermondii ATCC 201911 (L 2) to Cr(VI) and Cr(III) has been investigated. This yeast was demonstrated to have much higher resistance to Cr(III), compared to Cr(VI). At chromate level of 2. 0 mM, an expanded lag phase in growth was observed, followed by the active phase of cell proliferation. During the growth arrest, a residual external chromate concentration decreased gradually to the nontoxic level, and the duration of this period was directly dependent on the initial Cr(VI) concentration in the medium, i. e. the higher the Cr(VI) level, the longer the growth delay. Thus, the tolerance of P. guilliermondii <b>to</b> <b>chromate</b> depends on its capacity for extracellular reduction of Cr(VI). As a product of chromate reduction, Cr(III) forms complexes with the components of culture liquid, which are not effectively adsorbed by the cells and do not repress the growth of P. guilliermondii. When urea {{is used as a}} nitrogen source, not only chromate reduction, but also Cr(III) chelation were shown to decrease, compared to the medium supplemented with ammonium sulphate.

A total of 80 isolates were recovered, by enrichment cultures, from two different isolation sites (a distant pristine site [75 ° S 123 ° E] and a site near the secondary runway of Concordia). All isolates were classified to the genus Paenibacillus by 16 S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis and belonged to two different species (based on threshold of 97  % similarity in 16 S rRNA gene sequence). ERIC-PCR fingerprinting indicated that the isolates from the two different sites were not all clonal. All isolates grew well from 4 to 37  °C and were resistant to ampicillin and streptomycin. In addition, the isolates from the secondary runway were resistant <b>to</b> <b>chromate</b> and sensitive to chloramphenicol, contrary to those from the pristine site.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the stress {{experienced}} by Escherichia coli K- 12 exposed <b>to</b> <b>chromate,</b> and mechanisms that may enable cells to withstand this stress, were examined. Cells that had been preadapted by overnight growth {{in the presence of}} chromate were less stressed than nonadapted controls. Within 3 h of chromate exposure, the latter ceased growth and exhibited extreme filamentous morphology; by 5 h there was partial recovery with restoration of relatively normal cell morphology. In contrast, preadapted cells were less drastically affected in their morphology and growth. Cellular oxidative stress, as monitored by use of an H 2 O 2 -responsive fluorescent dye, was most severe in the nonadapted cells at 3 h postinoculation, lower in the partially recovered cells at 5 h postinoculation, and lower still in the preadapted cells. Chromate exposure depleted cellular levels of reduced glutathione and other free thiols to a greater extent in nonadapted than preadapted cells. In both cell types, the SOS response was activated, and levels of proteins such as SodB and CysK, which can counter oxidative stress, were increased. Some mutants missing antioxidant proteins (SodB, CysK, YieF, or KatE) were more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>chromate.</b> Thus, oxidative stress {{plays a major role in}} chromate toxicity in vivo, and cellular defense against this toxicity involves activation of antioxidant mechanisms.

Also chrome yellow {{is known to}} be prone to darkening or browning due to photochemical reduction of the pigment. This concerns especially the sulphate-rich, orthorhombic variety of the pigment; the monoclinic lead chromate variety appears to be much more lightfast [49 – 51]. However, in Field with Irises near Arles it is striking that especially the presumed pure lead chromate yellow buttercups in the foreground turned brown. Microscopic examination showed spotty remnants of material deposited on top of the bright yellow paint, concentrated in the hollows of impasto. This indicates that in this case the color change is not so much caused by light induced surface darkening of the pigment, but rather that external factors play a role, as brown remnants of restoration materials seem to have become embedded in the softened surface of the paint. 10 Van Gogh probably used at least two different types of chrome yellow in Field with Irises near Arles: almost pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4), which is medium yellow in color, and a more lemon yellow variety with approximately equal amounts of sulphate <b>to</b> <b>chromate</b> (PbCr 0.5 S 0.5 O 4). 11 For the paint reconstructions lead(II) chromate (PbCrO 4) was purchased from Aldrich (≥[*] 98 %).
