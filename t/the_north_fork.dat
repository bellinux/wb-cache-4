5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitored}} {{the flow of}} Little Butte Creek at seven different stream gauges: two on the south fork, three on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>fork,</b> and two on the main stem. The first opened in 1908 at the newly constructed Fish Lake Dam on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>fork,</b> while the last opened in 1927 near the Big Elk Ranger Station on the south fork. By 1989, all seven were closed. The data recorded by the lowermost gauges of both forks and the main stem are listed below.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three main-stem gauges, the USGS operates five other stream gauges in the Bull Run watershed. Each of the following tributaries has one gauge: Fir Creek, Blazed Alder Creek, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork,</b> the South Fork, and the Little Sandy.|$|E

5|$|Mount Baker is drained on {{the north}} by streams that flow into <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Nooksack River, on the west by the Middle Fork Nooksack River, and on the {{southeast}} and east by tributaries of the Baker River. Lake Shannon and Baker Lake are the largest nearby bodies of water, formed by two dams on the Baker River.|$|E
5|$|The Gunnison River is {{designated}} as a Gold Medal Water from 200 yards downstream of Crystal Reservoir Dam to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork.</b> This includes the 12 miles within the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Only artificial flies and lures are permitted, and all rainbow trout are catch and release. Additionally, fishing is prohibited within 200 yards downstream of Crystal Dam.|$|E
5|$|The faster-moving streams took {{advantage}} of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.|$|E

5|$|Nine miles (14km) {{north of}} Mangum, SH-34B {{branches}} {{off to the}} west, connecting {{to the town of}} Brinkman, and four miles (6km) later, SH-34A branches off to the west to the town of Willow. US-283 splits off to the northwest two miles (3km) after that, and SH-34 continues north, crossing into Beckham County. SH-34 then bridges over <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Red River. In Carter, the highway serves as the western terminus of SH-55. Five miles (8km) north of Carter, SH-34 crosses SH-152.|$|E
5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass. Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the headwaters of the Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
5|$|Since its inception, {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project, but no further work has been done since the 1980s. However, the Bureau of Reclamation continues to list the Auburn as a considered alternative for the future of its Auburn-Folsom South Unit project. As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork's</b> {{headwaters}} {{are located}} {{on the slopes of}} the [...] Rustler Peak. It flows southwest, receiving many small tributaries such as Jackass, Eighty Acre, and Friese creeks. Turning west, it flows just north of Butte Falls before merging with the South Fork.|$|R

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E
5|$|Below Lewiston Dam the Trinity River {{passes the}} towns of Lewiston and Douglas City and turns west, passing within {{a few miles of}} Weaverville, the seat of Trinity County and the main {{population}} center of the area. It then turns northwest, past Junction City, and receives <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Trinity River at Helena. Further west it passes the former mining settlement of Big Bar and enters a deep gorge, which provides the route for Highway 299, the principal road connecting Redding to the Humboldt Bay area. At Burnt Ranch it receives the New River from the north. At Salyer the South Fork, its main tributary, enters from the south, nearly doubling the flow.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1921, {{the upper}} Colorado River above the {{confluence}} with the Green River in Utah had assumed various names. Fathers Dominguez and Escalante named it Rio San Rafael in 1776. Through the mid-1800s, the river between Green River and the Gunnison River was most {{commonly known as}} the Grand River. The river above the junction with the Gunnison River, however, was known variously as the Bunkara River, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Grand River, the Blue River, and the Grand River. The latter name did not become consistently applied until the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|A {{post office}} called <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> was {{established}} in 1836, and remained in operation until 1906. The community {{takes its name from}} <b>the</b> nearby <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Salt River.|$|R

This stretches along <b>the</b> crest of <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Mountain from U.S. 33 (in the south) to where the Smoke Hole Road (28/11) nears State Route 28 just west of Petersburg (in <b>the</b> <b>north).</b> Other trailheads for NFMT, which looks down upon Smoke Hole from the west, are also located along Smoke Hole Road.|$|R
5|$|The largest fire in {{the park}} was <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> fire, {{both in terms of}} damage to {{structures}} and of area burned. The fire started on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western border. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15. The fire spread towards the northeast {{and by the end of}} the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau and on August 25 reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana. There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{bordered on}} the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, and the Flathead Provincial Forest and Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park in British Columbia. To the west, <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>fork</b> of the Flathead River forms the western boundary, while its middle fork {{is part of the}} {{southern}} boundary. The Blackfeet Indian Reservation provides most of the eastern boundary. The Lewis and Clark and the Flathead National Forests form the southern and western boundary. The remote Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located in the two forests immediately to the south.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
50|$|It rises at the {{confluence}} of Rice Creek and a smaller unnamed stream {{in the southern part}} of the Lassen Volcanic National Park. The river flows east, receiving Warner Creek from the left, and passes the town of Chester. It then empties into Lake Almanor, which is formed by the Canyon Dam. After leaving the dam the river cuts south into a gorge, and turns southwest to receive Butt Creek from the right. <b>The</b> East Branch <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Feather River, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork's</b> largest tributary, comes in from the left near Belden, where the river is impounded again at the Rock Creek Dam. It then flows southwards, through several hydroelectric dams, into <b>the</b> <b>north</b> arm of Lake Oroville.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> scenic <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Mountain Trail follows much of {{the ridge}} crest, and only one road (U.S. Route 33) crosses the steep, rugged ridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>North</b> <b>Fork's</b> {{construction}} entailed <b>the</b> {{building of}} <b>the</b> 1.9-mile-long <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Fish Ladder, {{one of the}} longest in the world. It also required a complex system to provide for downstream fish passage around the dam.|$|R
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, the Snake {{receives}} from the right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Snake River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape. The Snake River resumes its journey westwards, then enters the Snake River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E
5|$|Tenaya, Yosemite, Bridalveil and Pigeon Creeks {{join the}} Merced before it {{breaches}} the glacial moraine at the valley's end. From there the river picks up Cascade Creek and turns south near El Portal, flowing through Merced River Canyon. State Route 140 follows the river {{out of the}} west entrance to the national park, a few miles before the South Fork Merced River, the largest tributary, joins from the left. The river arcs northwest to receive <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork,</b> and a few miles after it enters Lake McClure, formed by New Exchequer Dam. Below New Exchequer, the river flows west through a heavily irrigated region of the Central Valley, passing through McSwain and Crocker-Huffman Dams and the cities of Hopeton, Delhi and Livingston. It joins the San Joaquin River at Hills Ferry, a few miles south of Turlock.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, a {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, flows generally west from the Strawberry Mountains before reaching the national monument. It turns sharply north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly, where <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> John Day River joins the main stem. Downstream of Kimberly, the river flows generally west to downstream of the unincorporated community of Twickenham, and generally north thereafter. Rock Creek enters the river {{at the north end of}} Picture Gorge. Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell, then north along the eastern edge of the Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day downstream of Twickenham. Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek, which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno.|$|E
