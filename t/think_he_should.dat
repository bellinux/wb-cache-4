2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.'

2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn't mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies." ...|$|E

As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be the boyfriend, part of me <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen.
