25|$|In Practicing Philosophy, Shusterman {{introduces}} {{his concept}} of ‘somaesthetics’, which he elaborates in greater detail in Performing Live. Somaesthetics {{is the focus of}} Shusterman’s two subsequent books, Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (2008) and <b>Thinking</b> <b>through</b> the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics (2012). The first of these books, translated into seven languages, helped establish somaesthetics as an international, interdisciplinary project involving scholars from fields beyond philosophy, while the second book consolidated this movement toward the interdisciplinary approach by applying somaesthetics to various arts, and cultural practices.|$|E

25|$|The 1552 Book of Common Prayer was {{influenced}} by Reformed <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> Scottish reformer John Knox's insistence on including {{what became known as}} the black rubric, a declaration that kneeling at the Eucharist did not imply adoration. Knox also wrote a liturgy for the newly founded Church of Scotland based on John Calvin's liturgy. Knox's liturgy set a structure for worship in Scotland, though ministers could improvise. Following to the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the English made several attempts to impose the Book of Common Prayer on the Scots, which they fiercely resisted.|$|E
25|$|Black female {{artists such}} as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have made great strides since the hip hop {{industry}} first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop. Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates women's struggle.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to a}} {{worrying}} scenario {{coming to}} dominate US strategic <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> the 1970s and 80s. If the Soviets launched a sneak attack on the US using {{only a portion of}} their missile fleet, about , aimed solely at US silos and airbases, they could hope to destroy as much as 90% of the US's fleet. This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US {{would not be able to}} respond with a counterforce attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would be a general attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in kind with their remaining fleet. In this situation, the Soviets would be in an extremely advantageous position for a negotiated peace.|$|E

500|$|Morris Dickstein of The New York Times {{was more}} {{critical}} of the book, calling it [...] "a misconceived and badly executed novel, a sideshow distraction from the serious business of <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era." [...] He described it as [...] "wearisome", and [...] "suffocate" [...] by too much [...] "fine writing" [...] (belles-lettres). He also complained that the characters are lifeless, and while they each have detailed histories, they are only [...] "verbal figments" [...] that do not separate them from one another. Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler's speech are drawn from some of Steiner's earlier works, he [...] "unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant—at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous." ...|$|E
500|$|Rand's first bestseller, The Fountainhead, {{received}} {{far fewer}} reviews than We the Living, and reviewers' opinions were mixed. There {{was a positive}} review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated. The reviewer called Rand [...] "a writer of great power" [...] who wrote [...] "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that [...] "you {{will not be able}} to read this masterful book without <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> some of the basic concepts of our time". There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it [...] "a whale of a book" [...] and another that said [...] "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style [...] "offensively pedestrian".|$|E
500|$|Storytelling is {{an ancient}} form of {{entertainment}} that has influenced almost all other forms. It is [...] "not only entertainment, it is also <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> human conflicts and contradictions". Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used {{as a component of}} any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on illuminated manuscripts and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones. Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, Chaucer used pilgrims in his literary work The Canterbury Tales in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in Journey to the West. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.|$|E

"Although {{the right}} of silence, in {{contrast}} to the right to counsel, can be exercised passively (by not speaking), a suspect’s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview. A suspect may want to listen to a recitation of the evidence against him or learn about the benefits of cooperation before deciding whether to exercise his rights. Or a suspect may be formulating an explanation of events that lessens his culpability, planning an alibi, or <b>thinking</b> <b>through</b> his options. Or he may be willing to talk about some topics but not others ... Simply presuming an invocation after some initial period of silence ... would override the wishes of those suspects who wanted to listen and deliberate further, rather than to end questioning. ...
