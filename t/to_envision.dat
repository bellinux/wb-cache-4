5|$|Scorsese {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} {{that among the}} most difficult aspects of the film to represent were the spiritual themes presented in Endo's original book used for the film. The first version of the script he attempted to write with his co-writer Jay Cocks only managed to get midway through the material, before being set aside as insufficiently sensitive to the spiritual aspects of the book. It took Scorsese many years <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> a way to approach an accurate and informed filming of the scenes, involving spiritual transitions among the actors in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{included a}} scripting team, who inserted pre-programmed scripts into the dialogue, a process {{referred to as}} scripting: these scripts {{could be used to}} change characters' animations, stop the text {{in the middle of a}} sentence, automatically proceed to the next text box, and pan the camera. The staff had <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> how scenes would look, and used these scripts to create a flow of character animations and add dramatic tension, such as adding a pause after a character sighs to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E

5|$|A common {{language}} {{may have been}} seen {{to serve as the}} basis of a nation, but as contemporary historians of 19th-century Germany noted, it took more than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The exigencies of Napoleon's campaigns in Poland (1806–07), the Iberian Peninsula, western Germany, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon's Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> a Central Europe free of Napoleon's influence. The creation of student militias such as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency.|$|E
5|$|The Pitch Document {{described}} Avatars as {{sharing the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> the past, present and future, both literally and symbolically. Accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an Avatar's birthright {{and can be}} improved through study and practice. Avatars can manipulate and transmit the resulting visions through dreams to others. As far as established, only Creatures of Darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers. Avatars can sense the existence of their moral opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity. They can, however, easily detect and locate an Avatar of like kind over great distances with great accuracy. These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E

5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, he would be able <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role.|$|E

25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to imagination is that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop about our selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> the experiences of others in their minds and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy toward others.

25|$|Scope: While new {{reactions}} {{are constantly being}} discovered, most reactions have extremely narrow substrate scope {{and the reason for}} such narrow scope is often not understood. In the field of palladium catalysis, after the foundations of mechanistic understanding were established, the scope of reactions saw rapid growth. Knowing the factors that affected each step of catalysis allowed for the chemists <b>to</b> <b>envision</b> and pursue new reactions of high synthetic utility, such as C-H bond activation reactions. In the field hydrogen bond catalysis, chemists have not yet reached a stage where new types of reactivity can be easily and systematically targeted. At this point, reaction discovery is useful, but more detailed mechanistic study is required to realize the full potential of hydrogen bond catalysis.|$|E
