5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E
5|$|Due to its short {{lifespan}} after harvest, lettuce {{was originally}} sold relatively close <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> grown. The early 20th century saw {{the development of}} new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> discovered.|$|E
50|$|In {{the arrow}} paradox (also {{known as the}} fletcher's paradox), Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the {{position}} which it occupies. He gives {{an example of an}} arrow in flight.

In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring. If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.|$|R

5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> needed.|$|E

25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E

25|$|By concentrating its {{military}} {{resources in the}} navy, Britain could both defend itself and project its power across the oceans as well as threaten rivals' ocean trading routes. Britain therefore needed to maintain only a relatively small, highly mobile, professional army that sailed <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> needed, and {{was supported by the}} navy with bombardment, movement, supplies and reinforcement. The Navy could cut off enemies' sea-borne supplies, as with Napoleon's army in Egypt. Other major European powers had to divide their resources between large navies, large armies, and fortifications to defend their land frontiers. The domination of the sea therefore allowed Britain to rapidly build its empire after the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) and throughout the 19th century, giving it enormous military, political and commercial advantages.|$|E

25|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} accidentally in ancient China, as it {{resulted from the}} drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used to boil salt water to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world's first industrial {{extraction of natural gas}} started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000km³ of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2–3% could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Quake II engine, Epic Games had {{unveiled}} its own Unreal Engine. The Unreal Engine was more realistic than Quake II and was better suited to producing open spaces—3D Realms had been struggling to render the Nevada desert. Soon after E3, a programmer suggested that they make the switch. After discussions, the developers unanimously agreed to the change, which would mean scrapping much of their work so far, including significant changes 3D Realms had made to the Quake Engine. In June 1998, 14 months after the Quake II announcement, 3D Realms made the switch announcement. Broussard said that the game would not be [...] "significantly delayed" [...] by the switch, but that the project would be back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at E3 [...] "within a month to six weeks". Broussard also said that no content seen in the E3 trailer would be lost. Chris Hargrove, one of the game's programmers at the time, confided that the change amounted to a complete reboot of the project.|$|E

500|$|As {{the war in}} Europe drew to a {{close and}} the United Nations Charter was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being {{considered}} to become the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, with American Secretary of State Dean Acheson and British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy. Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions. In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a [...] "world food board" [...] to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages. He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a world food reserve and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> most needed in times of need. Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, international development aid, commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947. The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.|$|E

2500|$|A {{thermal power}} station is a power station in which heat energy is {{converted}} to electric power. [...] In most of the {{places in the world}} the turbine is steam-driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator.

The greatest variation in the design of {{thermal power station}}s is due to the different heat sources; fossil fuel dominates here, although nuclear heat energy and solar heat energy are also used. Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy. Certain thermal power stations also are designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes, or district heating, or desalination of water, in addition to generating electrical power.|$|E

[...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it.
