500|$|In {{addition}} to the default [...] "Quick Flight" [...] mode, the player may play tutorial and [...] "Challenge" [...] missions. The game's <b>tutorial</b> <b>mode</b> features 26 lessons, which demonstrate basic and advanced flying techniques and then allow the player to perform them. Challenge missions test the player's flying ability with objectives such as locating Bigfoot, rescuing a stranded hiker, stopping a theft or flying through hoops. Eleven Challenges are available, but the player may create more or download them from the Internet. Flight Unlimited III includes the level editor ("FLED") used to develop the game, which allows players to use the game's assets to create airports, AI flight paths and edited landscapes. Players may share their creations online.|$|E
500|$|The game {{includes}} a story mode, arcade mode, versus mode, training room, <b>tutorial</b> <b>mode,</b> and online play using the GGPO networking library. Skullgirls includes various unique features to address system and balance problems, such as infinite combo detection. When the game detects a looping combo through monitoring the players' attacks, the other player can {{break free of}} the infinite by hitting any button. In addition, Skullgirls offers protection against [...] "unblockable attacks", which occur when a player, for example, uses a low-hitting move and a high-hitting assist attack at the same time, making it nearly impossible for the opponent to block. The game attempts to remedy the issue by offering {{a brief period of}} unblockable protection after successfully blocking any attack.|$|E
500|$|Samit Sakar (Polygon) {{felt that}} he was in control of all parts of his play, even as he lost to {{computer-controlled}} opponents. Joshua Calixto (Kill Screen) found himself naming his preferred ball-handling techniques as he played. While Nic Rowen (Destructoid) said that he would normally avoid game mechanics discussion in his reviews, [...] "Videoball is all about its mechanics". He praised the momentum and [...] "pleasing grip" [...] behind the avatars and the acceleration physics of changing direction or moving out of a full stop. Polygon Sakar noted the game's balance between competition and enjoyment. Despite the game's simple controls, Destructoid found that sloppy play could easily backfire on the player. Jason D'Aprile (GameSpot) said that the game depends on things knocking into each other for its entertainment, such as bank shots and hitting opponents. He disliked that the only control style was tank-style controls. Polygon initially wanted a <b>tutorial</b> <b>mode</b> but ultimately felt that the single-player Arcade mode, with set scenarios against two computer-controlled opponents, filled this need. Destructoid called the Arcade mode increasingly unfair in its addition of field disadvantages to the player. While Polygon and Destructoid praised the artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled avatars, GameSpot wrote that they were simple, and often ignored balls during single-player matches.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} the Advance Wars begins in the [...] "Field Training" [...] <b>tutorial</b> <b>mode,</b> with the nation of Orange Star in a war against the {{neighbouring}} nation of Blue Moon, with Olaf as the Blue Moon Army commanding officer (CO). Olaf suddenly ordered an invasion of the Orange Star nation, and is in battle with the Orange Star Army. The campaign continues the story that started in the tutorial. Nell, the de facto leader of the Orange Star COs, gives the player the duty of a tactical adviser for the Orange Star Army.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} is to defeat the enemy army. There {{are two ways to}} defeat an opponent: destroy every one of the opponent's units on the map or capture the opponent's headquarters. However, some maps have specific objectives, such as capturing a certain number of cities to claim victory. The available modes of play include [...] "Field Training" [...] which is a <b>tutorial</b> <b>mode,</b> a campaign mode which carries the game's storyline, the [...] "War Room" [...] which is a collection of maps on which the player strives for high scores, as well as multiplayer modes and a map design mode. The [...] "Campaign" [...] and [...] "War Room" [...] modes both help to rank the player up (from Rank #100 to Rank #1) and to earn coins to unlock COs and maps in the [...] "Battle Maps" [...] shop. The modes also gives the player a rank for effort after winning a battle on that map, which assesses by the speed, power and technique in that battle, speed being the number of days spent trying to win the battle, power being how many enemy units you defeated, and technique is the number of your units that survived (in percentage).|$|E
2500|$|Since its release, Mega Man Legends has {{received}} moderately positive critical response from video game publications although the ports for Nintendo 64 and PC received from mixed to negative comments. GameRankings {{had an average}} of 73.73% for the PS version. The PC and Nintendo 64 version had lower averages of 33.67% and 63.94%, respectively. On Metacritic, the Nintendo 64 port holds an aggregate 59 out of 100 based on six reviews The jump from a 2D platform video game series to a 3D action-adventure game was well received, as reviewers compared it with other video game franchises whose changes were overall negative. Despite the change, critics liked how Legends shares various elements from the original Mega Man series. Game Informer liked the variations of Mega Man's special weapons as [...] "There is plenty of shoot-em-up action for fans of traditional Mega Man titles." [...] The storyline of the game was also praised, being labelled as [...] "solid" [...] by Game Informer and [...] "engrossing" [...] by GamePro, the latter praising the bosses characters {{as one of the best}} ones from the whole series. On the other hand, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews with focus on the boss battles, but praise in the addition of a <b>tutorial</b> <b>mode</b> later added to the Nintendo 64 port.|$|E

At BIP's (BASIC Instructional Program) core is an information network which embodies the interrelations of the concepts, skills, problems, remedial lessons, hints, BASIC commands, and manual references. With the data stored in the student history, the network enables BIP to model the student's state of knowledge and to make problem selections with some relevance. After a brief overview of work done at Stanford in tutorial CAI and the teaching of procedural skills, the functional elements of BIP, its BASIC interpreter, curriculum solution analysis, and interactive assistance during programing are described.

Joystiq applauded the game for including everything that makes Tekken good, stating [...] "its surprisingly deep, accessible gameplay mechanics to its bombastic and hilarious attitude – all presented in a package more polished and refined than ever before." [...] GameSpot hailed this [...] "well-executed and punishing fighter" [...] for its combat system, online play, the Fight Lab mode, and customizable soundtrack, but criticized the inadequate <b>tutorial</b> <b>modes.</b> According to Eurogamer, [...] "It plays it a little safe in places and lacks a truly killer single-player mode, but by broadening the versatility of the tag system while dramatically improving the online functionality, Namco has crafted a new teamwork seminar that builds upon the original in almost all the areas that matter." [...] IGN was more critical of the game that while approving the core gameplay and content, felt that the similar gameplay of its predecessors {{made it difficult for}} newcomers of the series. Game Informer noted that the game does not overhaul the franchise, but retains the series' already solid gameplay, adding: [...] "It offers a ton of fighters, the tag system is interesting, it plays well online, and it preserves the goofy sense of humor that defines the series.

40|$|The BASIC Instructional Program (ElP) was {{developed}} to investigate <b>tutorial</b> <b>modes</b> of interaction in computer-assisted instruction (CAT). BIF is a problem-solving laboratory that helps students while they are solving introductory programming problems in the BASIC language.

This paper describes the RIP system, with emphasis on. recen'tly developed features. The goal of the tutorial laboratory is infonnative interaction with the stUdent, which is provided by an instructional BASIC interpreter, information on BASIC syntax cross-referenced with the BIP student manual, and debugging aids. The system also has access through the curriculum representation to features that the student may use to help her solve her current problem. These features include hints, ea. sier Itsubtasks," a stored solution that can itself be executed, and an interactive flow chart representation of the solution. The nature of the student-BIP interaction is captured in an annotated student dialogue of a typical session. I.
