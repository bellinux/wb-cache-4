Due to the geometrical structure and material properties, significant residual stresses appear in interconnects during integrated circuit fabrication, storage and service. The evaluation of these <b>triaxial</b> <b>stresses</b> is essential to understand failure mechanisms of IC’s. In this paper, we extended the method of measuring <b>triaxial</b> <b>stresses</b> in strongly textured thin films [Tanakagira] to compute the full stress tensors for Al and Cu thin films and interconnects through forming a X 2 -fimction. The minimization of the X 2 -mnction is implemented by solving a linear algebraic system with these stresses as unknown variables. The new method was benchmarked against the finite element simulations of residual stresses in interconnects. It was found that an underestimation of about 20 % is induced if the elastic anisotropy due to the (111) fiber textures in the fine Al and Cu lines is neglected while converting the measured strains to stresses.

The volume strain on the particle is relieved and voiding occurs. The energy absorption due to this increase in volume is theoretically negligible. Instead, it is the consequent shear band formation that accounts for increased toughness.

40|$|Concrete is a {{building}} material used for sensitive infrastructures like dams or nuclear reactors; however its behavior remains poorly known under extreme dynamic loading like rock falls, explosions or ballistic impacts.

Predicting its dynamic response needs first an experimental characterization of its behavior under extreme <b>triaxial</b> <b>stresses</b> and various con-trolled loading paths.

This study fundamentally clarifies the effect of strength mismatch, which can elevate plastic constraint due to heterogeneous plastic straining under static loading, on critical conditions for ductile cracking from the pre-notch root.

Earlier studies tested this hypothesis in a combined model of left ventricular (LV) mechanics and remodeling of myofiber orientation in response to fiber cross-fiber shear, assuming synchronous timing of activation and uniaxial active stress development. Differences between computed and measured patterns of circumferential-radial shear strain Ecr were assumed {{to be caused by}} limitations in either the LV mechanics model or the myofiber reorientation model. Therefore, we extended the LV mechanics model with a physiological transmural and longitudinal gradient in activation pattern and with <b>triaxial</b> active <b>stress</b> development. We investigated the effects on myofiber reorientation, LV function, and deformation. The effect on the developed pattern of the transverse fiber angle at, 0 and the effect on global pump function were minor. <b>Triaxial</b> active <b>stress</b> development decreased amplitudes of Ecr towards values within the experimental range and resulted in a similar base-to-apex gradient during ejection in model computed and measured Ecr. The physiological pattern of mechanical activation resulted in better agreement between computed and measured strain in myofiber direction, especially during isovolumic contraction phase and first half of ejection. In addition, remodeling was favorable for LV pump and myofiber function.
