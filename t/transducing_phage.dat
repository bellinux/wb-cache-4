50|$|In {{addition}} to its importance as a pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{has been instrumental in}} the development of genetic tools that led to an understanding of fundamental bacterial physiology. These developments were enabled by the discovery of the first generalized <b>transducing</b> <b>phage,</b> P22, in Typhimurium that allowed quick and easy genetic exchange that allowed fine structure genetic analysis. The large number of mutants led to a revision of genetic nomenclature for bacteria. Many of the uses of transposons as genetic tools, including transposon delivery, mutagenesis, construction of chromosome rearrangements, were also developed in Typhimurium. These genetic tools also led to a simple test for carcinogens, the Ames Test.|$|E
50|$|The Pseudomonas phage F116 holin is a non-characterized holin {{homologous}} {{to one in}} Neisseria gonorrheae {{that has}} been characterized. This protein is the prototype of the Pseudomonas phage F116 holin (F116 Holin) family (TC# 1.E.25), which {{is a member of}} the Holin Superfamily II. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence of N. gonorrhoeae revealed the presence of nine probable prophage islands. The genomic sequence of FA1090 identified five genomic regions (NgoPhi1 - 5) that are related to dsDNA lysogenic phage. The DNA sequences from NgoPhi1, NgoPhi2 and NgoPhi3 contained regions of identity. A region of NgoPhi2 showed high similarity with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa generalized <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> F116. NgoPhi1 and NgoPhi2 encode functionally active phages. The holin gene of NgoPhi1 (identical to that encoded by NgoPhi2), when expressed in E. coli, could substitute for the phage lambda S gene.|$|E

40|$|Two {{independently}} isolated specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>phages,</b> P 22 pro- 1 and P 22 pro- 3, {{have been}} studied. Lysates of P 22 pro- 1 contain {{a majority of}} <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> which can go through the lytic cycle only in mixed infection; these defective <b>phages</b> <b>transduce</b> by lysogenization in mixed infection and by substitution in single infection. A few of the <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> in P 22 pro- 1 lysates appear to be non-defective, being able to form plaques and to transduce by lysogenization in single infection.

The approximate location of the bacterial substitution on the phage and the ara gene content of the substitution were determined genetically. The precise location of the substitution was determined by electron microscopy of DNA heteroduplexes. <b>Transducing</b> <b>phage,</b> derived from the strain possessing h inserted into the a~&? gene, carried part of the araC gene, the ara regulatory region, {{and all of the}} araB gene. <b>Transducing</b> <b>phage,</b> derived from eight independent strains possessing h inserted in the same orientation and in the same position in the araB gene, oarried a portion of the araB gene, the ara regulatory region and all of the araC gene. In these nine cases the ara DNA on the phage was immediately adjacent to the normal phage attachment site, indicating that the t. ransducing phage were formed by the same type of abnormal excision which produces gal or bio transducing X phage.

Three classes of transducing particles were differentiated, depending upon whether they carried ilvA only, thyB and ilvA, or ilvD, thyB, and ilvA. Lysates prepared by the induction of strains that carried both a <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> and a plaque-forming phage contained the two particles in a ratio of about 1 : 3, 000. When the transducing particles were used to transduce a phage-sensitive auxotrophic strain to prototrophy, some of the transductants carried only the <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> genomes which, by themselves, were defective.

Genetically disabled (N- N- P-) lambda plac <b>transducing</b> the <b>phages</b> {{were used to}} study the dependence of specialized transduction on host RecA function and on {{the location of the}} lacZ gene in the recipient strain. In the absence of site-specific recombination at att lambda, transduction was completely dependent on host RecA function. Regardless of the configuration of att lambda, lambda plac <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> recombined at a 20 - to 50 -fold higher frequency with F 42 lac than with a lac gene located in the cellular chromosome. Deletion mutants of lacZ in the recipient strain were used to show that the probability of lac recombination resulting from lambda plac infection is apparently proportional to the amount of homology between the parental lacZ genes...|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} isolated thermosensitive mutant [Springer, M., Graffe, M. & Grunberg-Manago, M. (6977) Mol. Gen.

Specialized lambda <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> that <b>transduced</b> this mutant to thermoresistance were selected. In vitro studies showed that the transductants had a normal IF 3 activity. One of these <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> was shown to code for a protein synthesized under the control of Escherichia coli promoters, which has the same molecular weight as IF 3. This protein crossreacts specifically with IF 3 antisera and comigrates with pure IF 3 in a two-dimensional gel system...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of DNA gyrase-mediated illegitimate recombination in Escherichia coli, we examined the formation of λ Spi(-) phage during prophage induction. The frequency of Spi(-) phage was two to three orders of magnitude higher {{in the presence of}} oxolinic acid, an inhibitor of DNA gyrase A subunit, than {{in the absence of the}} drug, while it was very low in nalA(r) bacteria with the drug. RecA function is not required for the formation of these phages, indicating that this enhancement is not caused by the expression of SOS-controlled genes. Analyses of att region and recombination junctions of Spi(-) phages revealed that they have essentially the same structures as λbio <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> but are classified into two groups with respect to recombination sites. In the majority class of the <b>transducing</b> <b>phages,</b> there were not more than 3 -bp homologies bewteen the parental E. coli bio and λ recombination sites. In the minority class of the <b>transducing</b> <b>phages,</b> on the other hand, 9 - 10 -bp homologies were found between the parental recombination sites. These results suggested that oxolinic acid-induced illegitimate recombination takes place by two variants of a DNA gyrase-dependent mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of cystathionine gamma-synthetase {{directed}} by DNA from a lambdadmet <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> {{has been achieved}} in cell extracts from Escherichia coli K- 12.

Kinetic studies showed a 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -min lag between initiation of transcription and completion of a translatable message. This lag is shorter than that observed for beta-galactosidase synthesis with DNA from a lac <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> known to initiate transcription at the lac promoter. This result, together with information on the structure of the <b>transducing</b> <b>phage,</b> shows that pL is not used for initiation of in vitro metB transcription.

The coding capacities of a λaroA <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> containing a portion of this chromosomal region (R.

40|$|In Escherichia coli HfrH 58, {{isolated}} by Shimada et al., a heat-inducible phage {{has been}} integrated in a secondary attachment site. We have characterized tha {{nature of the}} lambda integration. The exuR regulatory gene is inactivated by prophage integration. Genetic and biochemical analysis indicated a gene order: uxaA-uxaC-exuT-(exuR') -lambdaNRAJ (exuR''). By induction of HfrH 58, one class of deletions extending into the exu region was obtained. Analysis of these deletions confirms the exu region topography and the regulatory mechanism of the hexuronate system previously described. It has been possible to regenerate a functional exuR gene by prophage exision. Various lambda transducing particles plaque-forming and defective <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> carrying the left part or the right part of the exu region, have been derived from the secondary site lysogen HfrH 58.

Of 20 such lysogens examined, 2 produce lysates with <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> containing the metBJF gene cluster (87 min). Reintroduction of the ppc-argECBH chromosome segment (which lies between the bfe and met genes) into these strains virtually abolishes the production of met <b>transducing</b> <b>phage.</b> All of the phage examined have lost essential genes from the left arm of the λ chromosome. Approximately 85 % of the phage appear {{to have the same}} genetic composition, containing the metBJF gene cluster, but not the closely linked gene cytR, and having lost phage genes G and J. Analytical CsCl density gradient centrifugation of five representatives of this major class of phage shows four of them to have identical densities (lighter than λ), while the fifth cannot be resolved from λ. The four apparently identical phage were isolated from three separate lysates, which suggests the existence of preferred sites for illegitimate recombination on the bacterial and phage chromosomes. Three specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> that carry cytR in addition to metB, metJ, and metF have also been studied.

Concurrent {{changes in}} transducing {{efficiency}} {{and content of}} transforming deoxyribonucleic acid in Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SP- 10. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 81 – 88. 1966. —Spores of Bacillus subtilis W- 23 -Sr infected with <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> SP- 10 served as convenient inocula for broth cultures from which <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> was harvested. Methods are described for producing highly infected spores. The inoculum level of infected spores in nutrient broth-yeast extract-glucose medium affected the transducing efficiency of SP- 10 in lysates of these cultures. Phage in lysates of cultures inoculated with about 105 or fewer spores per milliliter transduced 20 - to 350 -fold more efficiently than did phage in lysates from cultures inoculated with 106 to 107 spores per milliliter. Transduction frequencies {{in the order of}} 10 − 5 per plaque-forming unit were obtained routinely, and some infected-spore preparations yielded phage that gave frequencies as high as 10 − 4. The combination of inoculum level and incubation time required to produce the best <b>transducing</b> <b>phage</b> had to be determined empirically for each batch of infected spores. Several possible explanations for the difference between lysates having high (HTE) and those having low (LTE) transducing efficiency were ruled out by special experiments. The hypothesis is presented that some cultural condition resulting from a relatively low inoculum of phage-infected spores favors the incorporation by phage particles of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the manner required for the production of <b>transducing</b> <b>phage.</b> Support for this hypothesis is a demonstration, through transformation experiments with DNA extracted from HTE and LTE phage particles, that populations of HTE phage particles yielded significantly more (7 to 27 times) transforming activity per microgram of DNA than did populations of LTE phage...|$|E

A new hybrid plasmid (pMCR 533) carrying part of the unc operon was constructed by inserting the HindIII fragment of lambda asn- 5 DNA (a phage carrying the entire unc operon) into the unique HindIII site of pBR 322. This plasmid transformed eight unc- strains to Unc+, including uncB 402 and uncA 401, but did not complement uncD 11 or four other strains. Two minichromosomes which carry the E. coli replication origin were also tested: plasmid pNH 05 transformed the uncB 402 but not the uncA 401 strain to Unc+, whereas plasmid pMCF 1 transformed none of the mutants tested. Analysis of the DNAs from these <b>transducing</b> <b>phages</b> and plasmids with restriction endonucleases suggested that all of the structural genes for the F 1 -F 0 complex are localized within a DNA segment of approximately 4. 5 megadaltons containing two EcoRI sites.
