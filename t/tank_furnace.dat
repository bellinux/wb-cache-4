40|$|Glass {{was used}} since the Roman {{age in the}} {{building}} envelope, but it became widely applied together with iron since the 19 th century. Belgium was a major producer of window glass {{during the nineteenth century}} and the majority of the produced window glass was exported all over the world. Investigating the literature on the development of 19 th century Belgian window glass production is therefore internationally relevant. In the 17 th century, wood was replaced as a fuel by coal. In the 19 th century, the regenerative <b>tank</b> <b>furnace</b> applied gas as a fuel in a continuous glass production process. The advantages were a clean production, a more constant and higher temperature in the furnace and a fuel saving. The French chemist Nicolas Leblanc (1787 - 1793) and later the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay (1863) invented processes to produce alkali out of common salt. The artificial soda ash improved the quality and aesthetics of the glass plates. During the 19 th century, the glass production was industrialized, influencing the operation of furnaces, the improvement of raw materials as well as the applied energy sources. Although the production process was industrialized, glassblowing was still the work of an individual. By improving his work tools, he was able to create larger glass plates. The developments in the annealing process followed this evolution.

New forms were introduced using these older Islamic glass-working techniques, and of these, nargileh (water pipe) bases became the most dominant.

40|$|The present {{paper was}} {{compiled}} {{from the body}} of data obtained in authors ' laboratory. Since no single paper can hope to cover the whole important fields for the problems on the combustion and heat transfer in a glass <b>tank</b> <b>furnace,</b> the authors restricted the con-tents to some selected items, viz. (1) the length of gas flames, (2) the distribution of flame temperature and the evaluation of the so-called furnace temperature, and (3) the influence of convection current on the heat transfer in molten glass. The temperature distribution in a turbulent diffusion flame formed by gas and air issu-ing from separate ports was investigated. A simple formula for calculating the average temperature in vertical sections at every point along the axis of flame travel was presented. In connection with the actual furnace operation the above formula was applied for the prediction of the influences of the calorific value of fuel, and of the preheating temperatures of gas and air on the flame temperature which closely relates with the output of a tank. By means of model experiments using gas and water as medium the flow of gases in a tank was investigated, in order to visualize the influences of the velocity ratio of gas and air as well as the circulation of combustion products under crown ceiling on flame stability. Owing to the complexity of flow {{it was not possible to}} estimateexactly the contribution of the convection currents to the temperature distribution in molten glass. However, at least for some specified points, namely at the hot spot or others where the currents may be regarded as flowing in vertical direction, the heat transfer along these lines was studied with the results indicating that the effect of convection current should not be overlooked...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn 2001, in the ICG {{conference in}} Edinburgh, M. Cable [1] {{examined}} glass making progresses during the industrialization of the 19 th century. He observed that engineering and transport rapidly growing {{had a major}} influence on the scale of glass manufacture, increasing the ability to obtain fuel and raw materials and distributing products to the customers. Those factors largely contributed to the expansion of the glass industry but could not take place without improvements in technology. Among those new technologies, the Siemens regenerative furnace was a crucial development in glass making because it raised maximum achievable temperatures and greatly improved thermal efficiency. In 1954, F. W. Hodkin made a controversial communication to the Yorkshire Section of the Society of Glass Technology about the Siemens-Tank Story [2] which shows that there was some misinterpretation of information from W. E. S. Turner. Following this, the latter clarified his views to Hodkin who was stimulated to "enquire further into the points he has raised. " The Siemens "principle", the use of gas producers coupled with a "regenerative furnace" dates back {{to the end of the}} 1850 's (British patent No. 1320 in 1861). It was applied first to metallurgical and very soon to glass furnaces [2]. The "tank furnace" was patented only in 1872 (British patent No. 3478). In his letter reported by Hodkin, Turner said that "there is no doubt that the ideas of the Siemens brothers were worked out to a practical stage in England before being applied elsewhere [ [...] . ] From about 1865 onwards Siemens's gas furnaces, which until then had only acquired a solid footing in England, began to appear on the continent". M. Cable [1] says that "in 1861 William having obtained a British patent was negotiating with Chance Brothers, who at first wanted an exclusive licence, which William would not grant, and dithered, even after accepting that decision. " Looking at a well documented internal report written by H. de Coqueréaumont around the end of the first World War about the development of the plate glass technology in the Compagnie de Saint Gobain, it appears that, while William Siemens was discussing with Chance Brothers, or very shortly afterwards, in 1862, he was also in contact with the Glacerie de Montluçon, not yet part of the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, with the same aim, selling his invention,recently patented (May 1861 No 49068). During the same year in November 1862, contacts between W. Siemens and Saint-Gobain resulted in an agreement and in May 1863, the first Siemens regenerative furnace was alighted in the Saint Gobain glass factory. Besides dealing with the Siemens furnaces (regenerator and later, continuous <b>tank</b> <b>furnace)</b> developments in the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, by analysis of the technical data contained in this unpublished report, the present paper relates a few aspects of the story of the relationship of Saint-Gobain and W.

40|$|The {{need for}} a Combustion and Melting Research Facility focused on the {{solution}} of glass manufacturing problems common to all segments of the glass industry was given high priority in the earliest version of the Glass Industry Technology Roadmap (Eisenhauer et al., 1997). Visteon Glass Systems and, later, PPG Industries proposed to meet this requirement, {{in partnership with the}} DOE/OIT Glass Program and Sandia National Laboratories, by designing and building a research furnace equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostics in the DOE Combustion Research Facility located at the Sandia site in Livermore, CA. Input on the configuration and objectives of the facility was sought from the entire industry by a variety of routes: (1) through a survey distributed to industry leaders by GMIC, (2) by conducting an open workshop following the OIT Glass Industry Project Review in September 1999, (3) from discussions with numerous glass engineers, scientists, and executives, and (4) during visits to glass manufacturing plants and research centers. The recommendations from industry were that the melting tank be made large enough to reproduce the essential processes and features of industrial furnaces yet flexible enough to be operated in as many as possible of the configurations found in industry as well as in ways never before attempted in practice. Realization of these objectives, while still providing access to the glass bath and combustion space for optical diagnostics and measurements using conventional probes, was the principal challenge {{in the development of the}} <b>tank</b> <b>furnace</b> design. The present report describes a facility having the requirements identified as important by members of the glass industry and equipped to do the work that the industry recommended should be the focus of research. The intent is that the laboratory would be available to U. S. glass manufacturers for collaboration with Sandia scientists and engineers on both precompetitive basic research and the solution of proprietary glass production problems. As a consequence of the substantial increase in scale and scope of the initial furnace concept in response to industry recommendations, constraints on funding of industrial programs by DOE, and reorientation of the Department's priorities, the OIT Glass Program is unable to provide the support for construction of such a facility. However, it is the present investigators' hope that a group of industry partners will emerge to carry the project forward, taking advantage of the detailed furnace design presented in this report. The engineering, including complete construction drawings, bill of materials, and equipment specifications, is complete. The project is ready to begin construction as soon as the quotations are updated. The design of the research melter closely follows the most advanced industrial practice, firing by natural gas with oxygen. The melting area is 13 ft x 6 ft, with a glass depth of 3 ft and an average height in the combustion space of 3 ft. The maximum pull rate is 25 tons/day, ranging from 100 % batch to 100 % cullet, continuously fed, with variable batch composition, particle size distribution, and raft configuration. The tank is equipped with bubblers to control glass circulation. The furnace can be fired in three modes: (1) using a single large burner mounted on the front wall, (2) by six burners in a staggered/opposed arrangement, three in each breast wall, and (3) by down-fired burners mounted in the crown in any combination with the front wall or breast-wall-mounted burners. Horizontal slots are provided between the tank blocks and tuck stones and between the breast wall and skewback blocks, running the entire length of the furnace on both sides, to permit access to the combustion space and the surface of the glass for optical measurements and sampling probes. Vertical slots in the breast walls provide additional access for measurements and sampling. The furnace and tank are to be fully instrumented with standard measuring equipment, such as flow meters, thermocouples, continuous gas composition analyzers, optical pyrometers, and a video camera. The output from the instruments is to be continuously recorded and simultaneously made available to other researchers via the Internet. A unique aspect of the research facility would be its access to the expertise in optical measurements in flames and high temperature reacting flows residing in the Sandia Combustion Research Facility. Development of new techniques for monitoring and control of glass melting would be a major focus of the work. The lab would be equipped with conventional and laser light sources and detectors for optical measurements of gas temperature, velocity, and gaseous species and, using new techniques to be developed in the Research Facility itself, glass temperature and glass composition...|$|E

40|$|The {{chain of}} {{production}} of {{glass in the}} Roman to Byzantine period appears to have consisted of two phases.

For the silica component quartz sand was used, while natron {{was used for the}} alkali component.

This paper presents an interdisciplinary study based on a combination of archaeological and archaeometrical research. Excavated primary glass furnaces are used to build a 3 D CFD model of the ancient furnaces. Based on CFD calculations we provided further technical insights into the ancient production process such as the duration of the melting process, the amount of energy needed, the evolution of the temperature in the furnaces, etc. We also illustrate that the huge size of the ancient primary glass furnaces could be explained by the existence of economies of scale. status: publishe...|$|R

From an archaeological point of view, it is interesting to know when and where these tesserae were made, if they were new made or if they were reused tesserae recovered from earlier dismantled mosaics. The determination of the glass composition of the tesserae is not of great help in this connection, for the same kind of glass was used over long periods.

50|$|It {{should not}} be thought that Brill spent the entire decade ensconced in the Corning laboratory; he made various forays to the Middle East, {{including}} accompanying Wertime’s 1968 survey of the ancient technologies of Iran, alongside other great minds such as the noted ceramicist, Frederick Matson (UCL Institute for Archaeo-Metallurgical Studies 2007). In the years 1963-1964, the Corning Museum of Glass and the University of Missouri, following {{a long history of}} excavation at the necropolis of Beth She'Arim, conducted an examination of a huge slab of glass, some 2000 years old, that had been languishing in an ancient cistern (Brill and Wosinski 1965). Brill cannot recall who first suggested this slab, measuring 3.4m by 1.94m, could be made of glass, but the only way to test it was to drill a core through its 45 cm thickness and analyse it (Brill 1967, Brill and Wosinski 1965). On analysis of the core, Brill found that the glass was devitrified and stained, and not very homogenous, with a presence of wollastonite crystals throughout (1965, 219.2). Investigation of the manufacture technology required to produce the slab, suggested that in order to produce such a slab of glass, it would have been necessary to heat over eleven tons of batch material, and sustain it at around 1050˚C for between five and ten days (Brill 1967)! His initial interpretation was that the glass must have been heated either from above or from the sides using a kind of tank furnace; a hypothesis that was proven accurate when excavation underneath the slab suggested it had been melted in situ, in a tank whose floor was a bed of limestone blocks with a thin parting layer of clay (Brill and Wosinski 1965, Brill 1967). Brill’s interpretation, that the slab and its surroundings suggest ‘some early form of reverberatory furnace’ was the first suggestion of the use of <b>tank</b> <b>furnaces</b> in early glassmaking (1967, 92). The evidence at Beth She’arim encouraged further innovative thought because whilst the slab represented glass production on a grand scale, no associated evidence for glass working was found. Brill had already suspected that historical glassmaking occurred in two phases, the heavy ‘engineering’ stage when the glass is formed from the batch ingredients and the ‘crafting’ stage when the glass is formed into artefacts (Brill, pers. comm., 2009). These stages could occur in combination at one location, or at two differing locales, and the time span of production after the initial glass melt is highly flexible. For Brill, the idea of this ‘dual nature of all glassmaking’ was ‘crystallized’ at Beth She’Arim, where only the raw glass production was represented, and would be reinforced later by the contrasting evidence, where working was favoured over production, found at Jalame, as discussed below (Brill, pers. comm., 2009).|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} the port is 355 m. The quay has two berths, with a draft {{capacity}} of 9.25 m. Karwar port also berths coastal vessels {{and there is a}} jetty for fishing vessels. The Government of Karnataka has planned to develop Karwar port on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis to provide six additional berths, a container terminal, and a rail link to Shirwad railway station. The port is able to handle all types of commodities, including [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] class petroleum products. There port has liquid storage <b>tanks</b> for bitumen, <b>furnace</b> oil, molasses, and HSD. A ban of iron ore mining and export in Karnataka state reduced congestion at the port. The port has arrangements for berthing coastal vessels, and a jetty for fishing boats.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for the Czochralski {{growth of}} silicon crystals is presented which {{is capable of}} producing multiple ingots from a single crucible. The growth chamber features a refillable crucible with a water-cooled, vacuum-tight isolation valve located between the pull chamber and the growth <b>furnace</b> <b>tank</b> which allows the melt crucible to always be at vacuum or low argon pressure when retrieving crystal or introducing recharge polysilicon feed stock. The grower can thus be recharged to obtain 100 kg of silicon crystal ingots from one crucible, and may accommodate crucibles up to 35 cm in diameter. Evaluation of the impurity contents and I-V characteristics of solar cells fabricated from seven ingots grown from two crucibles reveals a small but consistent decrease in cell efficiency from 10. 4 % to 9. 6 % from the first to the fourth ingot made in a single run, which is explained by impurity build-up in the residual melt. The crystal grower thus may offer economic benefits through the extension of crucible lifetime and the reduction of furnace downtime...|$|R
40|$|In {{petroleum}} industries, {{especially in}} refineries installations, {{hundreds of miles}} of pipes are installed to transfer row and refined material (fluid and gas) from a point to another of the plant, connecting all the components involved in the transformation process (<b>tanks,</b> distillations columns, <b>furnaces,</b> etc [...] ). Recent seismic events showed a quite high vulnerability of these structures, where damage ranges from the simple failure of joints to the failure of supporting structures. For these reasons, initially the seismic analysis and component design of refinery piping systems is here analysed. A review of the current approaches imposed by European (EN 13480 : 3) and American (ASME B 31. 3) standards is illustrated by using a proper case study of a piping system on a pipe-rack. The analysis permitted to identify the limits of the design standards and to identify the critical aspects of the problem, i. e., dynamic interaction between pipes and rack, correct definition of the response factor, strain versus stress approach. Finally, the preliminary phases of an experimental investigation on flanged joints are also illustrated...|$|R
