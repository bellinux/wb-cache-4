60|$|Percy {{proceeded}} down-town, pondering. His first impulse, I {{regret to}} say, was to send Ruth's father an anonymous letter. This plan he abandoned from motives of fear {{rather than of}} self-respect. Anonymous letters are <b>too</b> frequently <b>traced</b> to <b>their</b> writers, {{and the prospect of}} facing Kirk in such an event did not appeal to him.|$|R
60|$|When the quarrel was over, Michele D'Cruze used to shamble {{across the}} low mud {{wall of the}} {{compound}} and make love to Miss Vezzis after the fashion of the Borderline, which is hedged about with much ceremony. Michele was a poor, sickly weed and very black; but he had his pride. He would not be seen smoking a huqa for anything; and he looked down on natives as only a man with seven- eighths native blood in his veins can. The Vezzis Family had <b>their</b> pride <b>too.</b> They <b>traced</b> <b>their</b> descent from a mythical plate-layer who had worked on the Sone Bridge when railways were new in India, and they valued their English origin. Michele was a Telegraph Signaller on Rs. 35 a month. The {{fact that he was}} in Government employ made Mrs. Vezzis lenient to the shortcomings of his ancestors.|$|R
50|$|Bearing {{witness to}} early {{settlers}} {{in the area are}} prehistoric barrows within Ohmbach’s own limits and also on land held by all the neighbouring municipalities. A great barrow from an unknown time lies on the heights of the Knechtenberg, but it is damaged, reportedly after having been half dug away in 1945 by the Wehrmacht. Gallo-Roman times, <b>too,</b> left <b>their</b> <b>traces.</b> The remnants of a villa rustica were unearthed as long ago as the 19th century. Reliefs from Roman times were built into the mediaeval churchtower. The originals of these spolia are now kept at the Historisches Museum Speyer.|$|R

Miss Vezzis drew twenty rupees a month for acting as nurse, and she squabbled weekly with her Mamma as to the percentage to be given towards housekeeping.

50|$|In 1391, Hallgarten had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention as Hargarten. Also {{belonging to the}} municipality is Dreiweiherhof, once a farmers’ and day labourers’ settlement that was once an Electoral Palatinate customs post with a brickworks. All that is now left of the brickworks is one stack, a landmark {{that can be seen}} quite far away. The Romans, <b>too,</b> left <b>their</b> <b>traces,</b> and from them also comes the name of the Römerstraße (“Roman road”). After an eventful history, Hallgarten passed in 1768 to Electoral Palatinate. In 1798, the municipality was incorporated into the French state, within which it found itself in the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German) until it passed {{under the terms of the}} Congress of Vienna to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. After the dissolution of the Rockenhausen district in 1969, Hallgarten was grouped into the Bad Kreuznach district. Today, Hallgarten is a recreational and residential community. The population hovers at about 800 and is growing steadily.|$|R
