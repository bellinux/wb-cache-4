5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>drain</b> {{has been}} renamed as the Black Sluice Navigation by the Environment Agency. In order {{to use the}} navigation, an Environment Agency licence is required, and as there are no {{permanent}} moorings available on <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> these are available for one day or seven days.|$|E
5|$|The South Forty-Foot Drain and the Black Sluice pumping station, {{together}} {{with most of}} the side channels which run into <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> are the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Management of the drainage ditches which drain the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region. Of these, 21 are situated on the banks of <b>the</b> <b>Drain,</b> and pump directly into it, while one, the Black Hole Drove pumping station, is constructed over the channel, and acts as a boundary between the part of <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> managed by the Environment Agency, and that managed by the Drainage Board.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>draining</b> of <b>the</b> Central Marshes was {{intended}} to reclaim land for agriculture and exterminate {{a breeding ground for}} the malaria-spreading mosquitoes. However, some Western and Islamist sources have described <b>the</b> <b>draining</b> as a political attempt to force the Ma'dan people out of the area through water diversion tactics.|$|R

5|$|The South Forty-Foot Drain {{serves as}} a {{district}} boundary over the length where it runs roughly south to north. South of Donington High Bridge, <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> separates South Kesteven to the west from South Holland to the east. The boundary then continues southwards along the River Glen. North of Donington, {{the boundary between the}} borough of Boston to the east and North Kesteven to the west follows the line of <b>the</b> <b>Drain.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> crosses the line of the Midfen Dyke, just before the Nottingham to Boston railway joins it at Great Hale pumping station, the boundary turns northwards, following its medieval course.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E

5000|$|... 5 September 2007: Spacecraft {{computer}} froze as {{a result}} of unknown influences, most likely radiation-induced upsets. This happened while the spacecraft was in full sun and with <b>the</b> power <b>drains</b> (30 W) on to prevent battery overcharging. Without the computer to cycle <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> off, <b>the</b> spacecraft remained in a continuous negative net power configuration which eventually <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> batteries. When the battery voltage dropped below 8 V, the electronic switches for <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> defaulted to off, returning the spacecraft to positive net power and allowing the batteries to recharge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>draining</b> of Mesopotamian Marshes {{began in}} the 1950s with the Central Marshes and {{gradually}} accelerated as it affected the two other main marshes until early {{in the 21st century}} with the 2003 invasion of Iraq. <b>The</b> <b>draining</b> of <b>the</b> marshes was intended at first to reclaim land for agriculture along with oil exploration but later served as a punishment for Shia Arabs in response to the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. <b>The</b> <b>draining</b> of <b>the</b> marshes was largely due to dams, dykes and other diversion structures constructed into Iraq but were exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Syria and Turkey.|$|R
5|$|Prior to 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper limit}} of {{navigation}} was initially Donington High Bridge, where the Swaton Eau joins the South Forty-Foot Drain {{and provides a}} wider section where boats can be turned. Beyond the bridge, <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> was officially only suitable for canoes and kayaks.|$|E
5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and {{a review of the}} flood defences was then carried out. The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was done at the time.|$|E

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> became {{wider and}} more extensive, there were {{proposals}} {{to use them}} for navigation, and a lock at Anton's Gowt was first suggested in 1779. Funds were not available at the time, and so land doors were built so that boats could access <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> until <b>the</b> lock was completed in 1813.|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice. <b>The</b> <b>drain</b> was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E
5|$|Water {{levels are}} {{maintained}} {{at a lower}} level during the winter months, when flows are high, and <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> {{needs to be able}} to cope with higher volumes of rainfall, than during the summer months, when navigable levels are maintained. As on the neighbouring River Witham, the switch between winter and summer levels is normally made at the beginning of April.|$|E
5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
50|$|In {{conditions}} {{when the}} pressure in a lymphatic is sufficiently great, the valves may fail, and there can indeed be backward flow of lymph resulting in edema of <b>the</b> <b>drained</b> region.

5|$|Browning {{supervised}} {{the newly formed}} division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry, and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the airborne forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> on Bomber Command's resources.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than to the rest of <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South Drain, a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to {{the south side of the}} canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South Drain. The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main job of <b>the</b> <b>Drain</b> is {{to gather}} the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens, the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke, a soak dike in Bourne North Fen, {{alongside}} the Bourne Eau and River Glen, northwards and eastwards to the Black Sluice at Boston, where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven. The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Two drains were built, {{of which}} the most {{successful}} was the Swinefleet Warping Drain, pioneered by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and authorised by an Act of Parliament. Opened in 1821, poor-quality land was reclaimed for around forty years. The other scheme was Durham's Warping Drain, {{to the north of}} Thorne, which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don. <b>The</b> <b>drain</b> was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham, but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors. He died in 1882, just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture. The change was brought about by an agricultural depression and the high price of straw for animal bedding.|$|E
