2500|$|The film's fiery final {{sequence}} {{was shot}} without a stunt performer {{filling in for}} Leigh McCloskey. After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey {{would be willing to}} perform the stuntwork himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg. The producer assured the actor: [...] "It'll be absolutely safe". The actor agreed, and when he walked onto the set the following day he observed [...] "three rows of flexiglass in front of everything and everyone is wearing hard hats. I'm the only guy standing {{on the other side of}} this! ...Needless to say, I did it all on instinct... I still feel that blast of the door blowing by me. When they <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> words, its one thing, but when you feel that glass go flying past you with a sound like a Harrier jet, you never forget it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Vana's {{criticism}} of the living conditions that candidates live {{in which they have}} zero contact with outsiders was also brought up a year later by contestant Aleksandra King who left the process in the fourth task, following her departure she said: [...] "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> exact detail how much contact I was allowed with my family but, for me, the restricted contact was not good enough. I {{would have liked to have}} picked up the phone and just said, [...] "How are you guys? OK, Great." [...] I was not able to do that. I've got a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old and a five-year-old but it's the work-life balance thing because there are other mums in there who have younger kids and it was OK for them. But for me, I started to get slightly irritated because I felt like why is this even a business tip, what has lack of contact with my family got to do with it? It was winding me up and going on in my head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a [...] "blame culture" [...] and the atmosphere [...] "wasn't necessarily great for business".|$|E

6000|$|... "But that's {{just the}} way it's to come," [...] I said uncomfortably. [...] "It <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the Bible. It's to come just like a thief in the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{might have}} had one of them; I don't mind <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> strictest confidence. But, {{goodness}} gracious, after I had once seen Kattie Forrester, {{there was no longer}} a doubt. I wish you'd <b>tell</b> me what <b>you</b> think about her." ...|$|R
60|$|JILL. Well, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first}} place, he's not amorous.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the last}} woe: but of it I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my next Lecture.|$|E
60|$|Thus much I thought {{proper to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{relation}} to yourself, {{and to the}} trust I reposed in you.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what if it}} were, sir? What if {{all that}} the {{charitable}} folks of Bideford--(Heaven reward them for their tender mercies!)--have been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the last hour be true, sir,--true! and yet not half the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I had--two things--one <b>in</b> particular. But <b>you</b> wouldn't {{promise to}} keep it a secret. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> now if you promise? As an honest woman I wish you to know it... It was what I began <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the night--about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel." [...] Arabella spoke {{somewhat}} hurriedly for her. [...] "You'll keep it close?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{could not}} be in safer hands, sir; and I know no better mode of giving you every {{possible}} assurance that the confidence will not be abused, than by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> return, that I would cheerfully lay down my life could the sacrifice restore the deposed family to the throne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And in the {{vacation}} I have been collecting evidence about ghosts--you remember our arguments. Though I did not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Send for the Wicked Witch. She will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{a moment}} whether that wooden-legged {{person is a}} common man or a magician." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We leave England for the Continent early {{tomorrow}} morning. Shall I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{what part}} of Europe my new residence is to be? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{you breathe}} a {{syllable}} to a soul--I'm going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something. <b>In</b> my opinion Tom Driscoll's chances were considerable better yesterday {{than they are}} to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did Mrs. Brownlow <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> her note?" [...] {{she asked}} {{of her brother}} while giving him his tea before the last service.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most likely Colonel Gansevoort can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> short order; but, if he can't, he won't be long in findin' {{out from}} General Arnold." ...|$|E
6000|$|She still {{declined}} to understand him seriously. [...] "Must I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> plain words that flattery is thrown away on me?" [...] she said.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come," [...] said she, [...] "I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something, <b>in</b> {{return for}} what you have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was refused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you {{for your}} admissions," [...] said Harold, still more quietly. [...] "So it seems that it is all true; it seems that you are using your wealth to harass this unfortunate gentleman and his {{daughter}} until you drive them into consenting to this marriage. That being so, I wish to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> privately what I shall probably take some opportunity of <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> public, namely, {{that a man who}} does these things is a cur, and worse than a cur, he is a /blackguard/, and /you/ are such a man, Mr. Cossey." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's a thing I {{shall never}} tell plainly; and perhaps if I try to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> riddles {{you will not}} care to guess them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, o’ course I have. I’m goin’ to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a minute," [...] {{said the}} old man querulously. [...] "Let me see—what’s his name again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly, Mademoiselle," [...] I said, [...] "but I {{have known}} him longer than <b>you,</b> and I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>in</b> a month he will not wish to come back." ...|$|R

60|$|What did I want? I didn't tell HIM; but I'll <b>tell</b> <b>YOU,</b> <b>in</b> confidence. I {{wanted a}} whiff of my pipe, and a turn at ROBINSON CRUSOE.|$|E

My man and Jemmy's maid had disappeared by this time: they always do when there's a robbery or a row going on.|$|R
