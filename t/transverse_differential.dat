40|$|Anisotropy of {{the silicon}} valence band {{does not lead}} to any {{significant}} anisotropy in the longitudinal hole transport properties, but we find that the transverse mobility is quite anisotropic. The transverse mobility represents the response of charge carriers to a small transverse electric field {{in the presence of a}} strong longitudinal field. A detailed, anisotropic Monte Carlo method has been applied to the calculation of the hole <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> mobility in silicon. The <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> mobility is studied both with regard to variations in the orientation, with respect to the crystalline axes, of the high longitudinal electric field, and with regard to variations in the transverse direction of the mobility, taken in the plane perpendicular to the high electric field. The anisotropy of the valence band causes the <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> mobility to strongly vary with respect to the electric field orientation. Symmetry considerations show that the <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> mobility is isotropic in the { 100 } and { 111 } planes and has twofold rotational symmetry in the { 101 } planes. Our calculations bear this out. Furthermore, we show that the transverse mobility can be much different from the chordal mobility, in distinction to the case for isotropic band structures. © 1995 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} valence band {{anisotropy}} on longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> high‐field <b>differential</b> mobilities, diffusivities, and thermal noise temperatures were theoretically investigated.

This suggests that thermal noise measurements may provide an alternative to magnetotransport methods as a valence bandstructure measurement technique.

Contributions to the magnetization processes from domain wall motion and rotation of the magnetization can be extracted from the <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> permeability data which are in turn obtained from impedance Z(Iac, f,Hdc) spectra. In particular, an iteration method is used to extract μ(Iac, f,Hdc) from Z(Iac, f,Hdc) data. The approach is tested in samples with a very well known domain structure, namely (110) [[001]FeSi 3 %. Permeability spectra μ(Iac, f,Hdc) were obtained in the frequency range (100 Hz<f<= 100 <=kHz), probe current range (0. 1 <Iac< 50 mA) and dc magnetizing field range (0 <=Hdc<= 500 Oe).

40|$|We {{investigate}} tunneling {{across a}} single ferromagnetic barrier {{on the surface}} of a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the presence of a magnetization component along the bias direction, a tunneling planar Hall conductance (TPHC), transverse to the applied bias, develops. Electrostatic control of the barrier enables a giant Hall angle, with the TPHC exceeding the longitudinal tunneling conductance. By changing the in-plane magnetization direction it is possible to change the sign of both the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> conductance without opening a gap in the topological surface state. The transport in a topological insulator/ferromagnet junction can thus be drastically altered from a simple spin-valve to an amplifier.

40|$|We {{develop a}} mixed finite-element {{approximation}} scheme for Kirchhoff plate theory {{based on the}} reformulation of Kirchhoff plate theory of Ortiz and Morris [1]. In this reformulation the moment-equilibrium problem for the rotations is in direct analogy {{to the problem of}} incompressible two-dimensional elasticity. This analogy in turn opens the way for the application of diamond approximation schemes (Hauret et al. [2]) to Kirchhoff plate theory. We show that a special class of meshes derived from an arbitrary triangulation of the domain, the diamond meshes, results in the automatic satisfaction of the corresponding inf[*]−[*]sup condition for Kirchhoff plate theory. The attendant optimal convergence properties of the diamond approximation scheme are demonstrated by means of the several standard benchmark tests. We also provide a reinterpretation of the diamond approximation scheme for Kirchhoff plate theory within the framework of discrete mechanics. In this interpretation, the discrete moment-equilibrium problem is formally identical to the classical continuous problem, and the two differ only in the choice of differential structures. It also follows that the satisfaction of the inf[*]−[*]sup condition is a property of the cohomology of a certain discrete <b>transverse</b> <b>differential</b> complex. This close connection between the classical inf[*]−[*]sup condition and cohomology evinces the important role that the topology of the discretization plays in determining convergence in mixed problems...|$|E
