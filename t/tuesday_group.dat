5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican Caucus on October 20, where he {{explained}} that he would run for Speaker if he could be guaranteed an overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The <b>Tuesday</b> <b>Group</b> by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.|$|E

As revised by the MacArthur Amendment, the ACHA weakens protections for patients with preexisting conditions; under {{this version of the}} bill, insurers would be able to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition.|$|E

50|$|Disinclined {{to use the}} Council {{meetings}} for advice, Johnson, like Kennedy, relied heavily on his National Security Advisers: McGeorge Bundy, who remained in office through February 1966, and Bundy's successor, Walt Rostow, who served {{to the end of}} the administration. Indeed, scholars looking at the evolution of the NSC from its inception to the 1970s contend that the National Security Adviser and his White House centered staff increasingly assumed a more prominent role than the official National Security Council and that Johnson, like Kennedy before him, played a key role in this development. Focusing on Johnson's Presidency alone, however, some of his advisers, including Secretary of State Rusk and Walt Rostow, insisted that the Council's advisory role was actually performed principally by another institution, the <b>Tuesday</b> Lunch <b>Group,</b> and that those lunch meetings were in effect regular NSC meetings.|$|R
5000|$|The small, informal, Tuesday luncheon {{meetings}} {{were much more}} to Johnson's liking than formal NSC meetings and quickly gained a prominent place in the decision-making process. Embracing the Secretaries of State and Defense and the National Security Adviser, the <b>Tuesday</b> Lunch <b>Group</b> met 27 times between February and September 1964. In all Johnson convened some 160 Tuesday luncheons during his Presidency, and the group was gradually expanded to include his press secretary, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The participants uniformly praised the [...] "strong collegial sense" [...] at the meetings and the opportunity for [...] "extraordinary candor," [...] but subordinates often complained that the secrecy and informality that encouraged candor also made it {{hard for them to}} prepare their superiors properly for the meetings and implement the decisions that were reached.|$|R
