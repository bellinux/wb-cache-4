5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had {{emotional}} trouble {{during his}} childhood and entered special education {{at an early}} age. He enrolled in the Army {{in search of a}} disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, he struggled with drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader {{toward the end of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his release}} from active duty, Madgwick {{spent the rest of}} 1946 as Executive Officer for the Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee on Education in Canberra. In this role, he helped plan and {{establish}} the Australian National University, acting as secretary on the new university's interim council. At the same time he served as Secretary to the first Commonwealth Committee which allocated federal funds to universities for research. Madgwick later explained that these experiences at the federal government level influenced his belief that adult education programs should be decentralised to the state level. He added that <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> Australian National University helped him in later establishing the University of New England as an independent school.|$|E

5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive for}} women's {{suffrage}} was reinvigorated in the 1870s, and {{was sponsored by}} the leaders of the prohibition movement, especially the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The Indiana branch of the American Woman Suffrage Association was re-established in 1869. In 1878 May Wright Sewall founded the Indianapolis Equal Suffrage Society, which fought for world peace before the nation plunged into World War I. Several Indiana women also became temperance leaders and took {{an active role in the}} movement. The Indiana chapter of the WCTU was formed in 1874 with Zerelda G. Wallace as its first president. Like many other suffrage leaders, Wallace was radicalized for woman's suffrage through her temperance reform work. During her 1875 speech before the Indiana General Assembly in support of prohibition, legislators demonstrated an open contempt for women involved in politics and speaking in public. Afterward, Wallace credited <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> her embrace of suffrage.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> patent and export problems led them to eschew patents entirely. PGP 3 introduced use of the CAST-128 (a.k.a.

The ambulance reached the scene usually within 14minutes, plus of course the 4½-minute pre-response time. One call took 25minutes owing to heavy traffic.

25|$|With {{insufflation}} {{the effects}} are more abrupt and intense but have a significantly shorter duration, while oral usage results in a milder, longer experience. When insufflated, the onset happens very rapidly, usually reaching the peak at about 20–40 minutes and plateauing for 2–3 hours. 2C-B is also {{considered one of the}} most painful drugs to insufflate, with users reporting intense nasal burning lasting as long as 30 minutes.

25|$|As {{a result}} of his strong student record, Rae was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he studied at Balliol College, Oxford under Isaiah Berlin. His Bachelor of Philosophy thesis criticized the {{cultural}} imperialism of early Fabian socialists in the United Kingdom, such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb. During his period in Britain he became involved with social work, helping squatters find rental accommodation in London. He attributes <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> helping him develop a deepened commitment to social justice and, on his return to Canada in 1974 Rae joined the social democratic NDP.

25|$|The Morane-Saulnier MS.230 {{featured}} as {{the fictional}} 'new monoplane' in the 1966 World War I epic The Blue Max {{and was the}} aircraft in which the central character Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) meets his demise. Peppard purchased the aircraft and took {{it back to the}} U.S. where it joined the collection of the San Diego Aerospace Museum. The plot, which has Stachel wringing-out a new design until it sheds its wings, is based on <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the late-war Fokker E.V, a parasol design, three of six of which crashed within a week of being delivered to Jasta 6 in August 1918. Grounded for investigation, the problem was traced to shoddy workmanship at the Mecklenburg factory where defective wood spars, water damage to glued parts, and pins carelessly splintering the members instead of securing them were discovered. Upon return to service two months later, the design was renamed the Fokker D.VIII in an effort to avoid the type's reputation as a killer.|$|E
25|$|External {{financing}} {{institutions were}} concerned with the insufficient capacity to operate and maintain the infrastructure they were financing in Lebanon. Until 2000 there were 21 water authorities in Lebanon who were financially and technically weak. The limited sewer networks, if they existed at all, were managed by the respective municipalities, which had often even less technical and financial capacity than the water authorities. In {{the absence of a}} sanitation tariff, municipalities lacked the financial resources to operate and maintain sanitation infrastructure. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> wastewater treatment plants is illustrative of the difficulties encountered. For example, the operating costs for the first wastewater treatment plant in Lebanon, the Al-Ghadir plant in Beirut completed in 1997, still have to be subsidized by the government because the municipal governments in the service area (the Beirut and Baabda districts) lack the resources to do so. Furthermore, incomplete infrastructure considerably reduces the development impact of the plant. Because the construction of sewers was delayed, most of the sewage of Southern Beirut still flowed into the Mediterranean without any treatment via both the Al Ghadir River and sea outlets. The Al Ghadir plant provides only preliminary treatment, followed by discharge through a 2.6km marine outfall. The second wastewater treatment plant built in Lebanon, intended for the city of Baalbek and completed in 2001, could not be put into operation, because both the sewer system and the outfall main were not completed. Wastewater treatment plants in Tripoli and Sidon were inaugurated in 2009 and 2010 respectively, both long after they were due to be completed.|$|E
