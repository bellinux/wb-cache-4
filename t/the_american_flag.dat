5|$|During {{her stay}} in New York, President Woodrow Wilson ordered {{a number of}} ships of the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in {{response}} to tension created when a detail of Mexican federal troops detained an American gunboat crew at Tampico. The problem was quickly resolved locally, but Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the act by the Huerta regime and a 21-gun salute to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon Buckles' {{death on}} February 27, 2011, President Barack Obama ordered that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> be flown at half-staff on all {{government}} buildings, including the White House and U.S. embassies, {{on the day}} in March when Buckles would be buried at Arlington.

5|$|Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's {{ultimate}} goal is to raise <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> upside down, a classic signal of distress.

5|$|Buckner {{was again}} cited for gallant conduct at the Battle of Molino del Rey, and was {{appointed}} a brevet captain. He {{participated in the}} Battle of Chapultepec, the Battle of Belen Gate, and the storming of Mexico City. At {{the conclusion of the}} war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation, which left them time for leisure activities. Buckner joined the Aztec Club, and in April 1848 {{was a part of the}} successful expedition of Popocatépetl, a volcano southeast of Mexico City. Buckner was accorded the honor of lowering <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a review}} of facilities, the US Navy elected to vacate the West Ruislip site, {{beginning}} on 30 June 2006. The final chapel service had been held on 5 June. Many operations returned to the United States, {{as part of a}} plan to save $1 million each year. Staff redundancies involved 7 US service personnel, 55 civilian staff from the US Department of Defence and 95 British civilian staff. The base closed during a ceremony on 28 September, in which <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> and Royal Air Force Ensign were lowered.|$|E

His first jobs were delivering newspapers for the Indianapolis Star in the morning, and the Bedford Times in the evening. He also worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store. He occasionally spent time at a local airport in Bedford, Indiana, where he first became interested in flying. A local attorney who owned a small plane would take him on flights for a $1 fee and taught him the basics of flying.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Eastwood {{directed}} {{two films}} about World War II's Battle of Iwo Jima. The first, Flags of Our Fathers, {{focused on the}} men who raised <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by Letters from Iwo Jima, which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers {{on the island and}} the letters they wrote home to family members. Letters from Iwo Jima was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for Letters from Iwo Jima. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. Letters from Iwo Jima won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
5|$|The Gloucester was {{the first}} ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica. Twenty-eight sailors and Marines, {{under the command of}} Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, {{departed}} from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag.</b> They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. Méndez López and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez López and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{going to}} war against France, the British Royal Navy began intercepting ships of neutral {{countries}} bound for French ports. The French imported large amounts of American foodstuffs, and the British hoped to starve the French into defeat by intercepting these shipments. In November 1793 the British government widened the scope of these seizures to include any neutral ships trading with the French West Indies, including those flying <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag.</b> By the following March, over 250 U.S. merchant ships had been seized and their crews impressed. Americans were outraged, and angry protests erupted in several cities. Many Jeffersonians in Congress demanded a declaration of war, but Congressman James Madison instead called for strong economic retaliation, including an embargo on all trade with Britain. Further inflaming anti-British sentiment in Congress, news arrived while the matter was under debate that the Governor General of British North America, Lord Dorchester, had made an inflammatory speech inciting the Indians in the Northwest Territory against the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Hamm {{helped lead}} the U.S. {{national}} team to its second {{gold medal at the}} 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and was selected by her fellow Olympians to carry <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> at the closing ceremony. During the team's first group stage match against Greece, Hamm served the cross to Shannon Boxx's game-opening goal, and scored the last goal of the match to lift the U.S. to a 3–0 win. During a 2–0 win over Brazil in the second group stage match, Hamm converted a penalty kick for the opening goal. The U.S. finished at the top of Group C with seven points after a 1–1 draw against Australia to advance to the quarter-finals, where they defeated Japan 2–1. During the semi-final match against Germany, Hamm served an assist to Heather O'Reilly who scored in overtime to secure a 2–1 win. The U.S. faced Brazil for a second time at the Games in the gold medal match and won 2–1 in overtime. Her teammates swarmed Hamm after the final whistle to celebrate their second Olympic gold medal and her final win at the Olympics. The game marked the last Olympic appearance for the five remaining players who had helped win the inaugural 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup: Hamm, Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett, Brandi Chastain, and Kristine Lilly (often referred to as the Fab Five).|$|E
5|$|In 1575, a Spanish {{exploration}} party led by Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeno {{landed in}} Drakes Bay near Point Reyes {{and was the}} first European settler to claim land in the Bay Area. He was soon followed in 1579 by Sir Francis Drake, who also landed in Drakes Bay and claimed the land for England. The San Francisco Bay itself remained undiscovered by Europeans until a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà sailed through the Golden Gate Strait in 1769. Further expeditions by Spanish explorers in the following years include those led by Juan Bautista de Anza who colonized the Presidio, and Gabriel Moraga who started at the Presidio and led expedition parties to San Jose and over the Pacheco Pass, as well as reaching the San Joaquin Valley. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the Bay Area became part of the Mexican province of Alta California, a period characterized by ranch life and visiting American trappers. Mexico's control of the territory would be short-lived, however, and in 1846, a party of settlers occupied Sonoma Plaza and proclaimed the independence of the new Republic of California. That same year, the Mexican-American War began, and American captain John Berrien Montgomery sailed the USS Portsmouth into the bay and seized San Francisco, which was then known as Yerba Buena, and raised <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> for the first time over Portsmouth Square.|$|E

5|$|While under construction, {{the tower}} was {{specially}} illuminated on several occasions. On {{the weekend of}} July 4, 2011, it was lit up with the colors of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> to commemorate Independence Day, and it was lit {{up with the same}} colors on September 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. On October 27 of that same year, it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On December 11, the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season.
