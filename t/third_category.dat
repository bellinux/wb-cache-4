5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or <b>third</b> <b>category,</b> with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The <b>third</b> <b>category</b> of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The <b>third</b> <b>category</b> of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kenna is tied as the third-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} {{to strike}} {{the west coast of}} Mexico in recorded history. Kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression, thirteenth tropical storm, seventh hurricane, sixth major hurricane, and <b>third</b> <b>Category</b> 5 hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. After forming on October 22 to the south of Mexico from a tropical wave, forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it actually did. Moving into an area of favorable upper-level conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, Kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on October 25 while located about 255mi (410km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Weakening as it turned to the northeast, the hurricane struck near San Blas, Nayarit, with winds of 140mph (225km/h) before dissipating on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{becoming}} a hurricane, Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17mi (27km) wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast. Early on October 24 Kenna {{became a major}} hurricane, and in a 24‑hour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70mph (115km/h) winds to 145mph (235km/h). After turning {{to the north and}} northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough, Kenna attained peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) early on October 25 while located about 255mi (410km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, the <b>third</b> <b>Category</b> 5 hurricane of the season. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913mbar (hPa), the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane.|$|E

5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or <b>third</b> <b>category</b> (first being the highest), with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Spanish rider Pedro Muñoz. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E
