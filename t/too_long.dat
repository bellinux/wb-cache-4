5|$|I King Æthelstan, {{declare that}} I {{have learned that}} the public peace has not been kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors say that I have suffered this <b>too</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5|$|I've {{had a great}} time, but I'm frightened that, if I {{stick around}} <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> I'll end up unable to do {{anything}} else. It's not about money, it's about doing other things and not wanting Mike to pale into insignificance.|$|E

60|$|He did so, and, {{by way of}} {{composing}} his own nerves, took a tumbler of champagne. He had {{no longer}} any thought of anxiety or danger, and he, <b>too,</b> <b>longed</b> for air. They passed out into the garden, and, by a common consent, {{made their way to}} the museum verandah, which was, as it proved, quite deserted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Purely a civil, or uncivil, contract, as {{the case}} may be. The holy state of {{judicial}} separation, <b>too,</b> has <b>long</b> been unknown." ...|$|R
5|$|Two days later, the Red Sox fired Grady Little. People blamed him for {{the game}} seven loss, {{claiming}} he left Martínez in for <b>too</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Tories {{contended that}} the Liberals had been in power <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> {{and that it was}} time for a change. The PC party stated that the Liberals were arrogant, inflexible, and not capable of looking at {{problems}} from a new point of view. Liberals responded that with the country prosperous, there was no point to a change.|$|E
5|$|For the Shakkanakkus, {{the lists}} are {{incomplete}} and after Hanun-Dagan who ruled {{at the end}} of the Ur era c. 2008 BC (c. 1920 BC Short chronology), they become full of lacunae. Roughly 13 more Shakkanakkus succeeded Hanun-Dagan but only few are known, with the last known one reigning not <b>too</b> <b>long</b> before the reign of Yaggid-Lim who founded the Lim dynasty in c. 1830 BC.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the world, in Australia, Keith Townsend, son of a millionaire {{newspaper}} owner, is being groomed to follow in his father's footsteps. Private schools, an Oxford degree, and a position at a London newspaper lead him up to the time of his father's death, when he takes over the family business. His energy and brilliant strategic thinking quickly make him the leading newspaper publisher in Australia. Yet he <b>too</b> <b>longs</b> to move on to the world stage.|$|R
50|$|On 27 June 2017, the {{originally}} planned trip to Hartlepool United was cancelled due to <b>too</b> many <b>long</b> distance away matches {{as the season}} approaches.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hutchins embraced me. And {{through her}} tears she, <b>too,</b> looked <b>long</b> into my face. When she had {{released}} me Ezra had his watch in his hand.|$|R
5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that he could get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on <b>too</b> <b>long</b> he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} line filter {{may be a}} collimator, which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of <b>too</b> <b>long</b> a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used here to block light.|$|E

50|$|King et al. 2004 {{showed that}} when short lived T cells were {{replaced}} during {{a state of}} <b>too</b> few <b>long</b> lived T-cells (memory T cell), {{because of lack of}} infections, the risk of developing autoimmune diseases increases. They showed that in a state of <b>too</b> few <b>long</b> lived T-cells, because of lack of infections, not enough short lived T cells could be produced by long lived T cells during homeostatic expansion. Therefore, more auto reactive T cells divide in such a state, causing multiplying auto reactive T cells with a greater risk of causing autoimmune diseases like Type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis.|$|R
5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas seem to {{have been}} mostly {{neglected}} during the entire nineteenth century, often dismissed for being <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> lacking in formal coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references to the last sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E
5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view that nothing could possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E
5|$|The Adagio is in sonata {{form and}} {{presents}} a single theme. While the exposition modulates to a re-statement {{of the theme}} in F major, the recapitulation modulates to D major. The movement ends in that key, pianissimo, with a segue (an explicit direction given by Haydn to avoid <b>too</b> <b>long</b> a pause between the movements) to the D-major minuet.|$|E
6000|$|... "The horses, <b>too?</b> How <b>long</b> have I been ill, and has any rain fallen?" [...] I asked, {{with the}} strange {{steadiness}} that sometimes follows a crushing blow, and Thorn moodily shook his head.|$|R

50|$|The {{skull of}} Pterofiltrus is very elongated, with an {{estimated}} length of 208 millimetres. It has a smooth, slightly concave, upper profile lacking any bony crests. The lower jaws <b>too</b> are <b>long,</b> and without a keel.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{scenario for}} the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of A Star Is Born. The idea was reworked due to being <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Knight {{introduces}} enemy medics who can shield {{enemies in}} electrified fields and revive unconscious ones, sword-wielding enemies, and brutes who {{are resistant to}} damage and must be stunned {{before they can be}} attacked; brutes wielding Gatling guns, tasers, and blades require additional steps to defeat. Enemies are capable of employing tactics to counter Batman's various skills, including deploying landmines, controlling hovering drones, disabling vents if Batman is found using them, and detecting his location if Batman uses Detective Vision for <b>too</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E
60|$|I, <b>too,</b> <b>longed</b> for a Cause {{into which}} I might fling myself, in which I might lose myself... I halted on the {{sidewalk}} to find myself staring from {{the opposite side of}} the street at a familiar house, my old landlady's, Mrs. Bolton's, and summoned up before me was the tired, smiling face of Hermann Krebs. Was it because when he had once spoken so crudely of the University I had seen the reflection of her spirit in his eyes? A light still burned in the extension roof--Krebs's light; another shone dimly through the ground glass of the front door. Obeying a sudden impulse, I crossed the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure thing, Aleck. And you'll want to go, <b>too,</b> before <b>long.</b> Think {{of flying}} along like a bird!" [...] And Tom Rover spread {{out his arms}} and moved them slowly up and down. [...] "Oh, it's grand!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a C-, stating [...] "That was <b>too</b> damn <b>long</b> {{to tell a}} story with so little substance and so few real laughs. Kinda like Cloverfield. Maybe that was the point".|$|R
5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, {{hoping to}} slip past the inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night). However, the combination of working for <b>too</b> <b>long</b> without a break, combined {{with a lack of}} support from Stratton-Smith and Charisma and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
5|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the second Wolverine film in August 2009. Darren Aronofsky was chosen to direct the film, though bowed out, stating the project would keep him out of the country for <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> James Mangold was later chosen to direct the film. Mark Bomback was then hired to rewrite McQuarrie's script. Principal photography began in August 2012 in Sydney, Australia, and ended in November. The film was released on July 26, 2013.|$|E
60|$|The {{man came}} hesitatingly forward. He was {{obviously}} distressed and uneasy, and found speech difficult. His face glistened with the rain which had found its way, <b>too,</b> in <b>long</b> streaks down his velveteen coat. His white hair was wind-tossed and disarranged.|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} years, Loppé became fascinated with {{photography}} and {{was quite an}} innovator in this field <b>too.</b> His <b>long</b> exposure photograph of the Eiffel Tower struck by lightning, now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris remains one of his iconic images.|$|R
50|$|The island {{formerly}} had a Māori {{population of}} 200. Notable Māori inhabitants included Kai Tahu chief Tūhawaiki and John Topi Patuki, MLC. A mission station was established {{on the island}} in 1843 by the Rev Johan Wohlers, but it <b>too</b> is <b>long</b> gone.|$|R
