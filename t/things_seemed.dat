5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{be going}} well for the band when it was {{announced}} that the Ignition Records label would be going out of business. Suddenly, the band no longer had a recording contract and, as a result, no label support. As this was happening, the band {{was in the midst of}} what would be their final tour of California. Kyle Herrman, a friend of the band, accompanied them for several days and filmed the documentary, Mass Appeal Madness. While initially only available at the band's final show, the film would continue to be sold on the internet for several more years.|$|E
25|$|The weather {{continued}} to threaten Australia's chances of victory, but when Alderman cheaply removed first Stephenson (LBW for 11), then Gooch (caught and bowled for 10), and Lawson removed Atherton (bowled for 14), the Australians smelt victory. England were reduced further when Gower was caught at cover for 17 by Waugh off Lawson, and at 67 for 4, <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> dire. Robin Smith {{came to the}} rescue, steadying the innings, and a very defensive 17 from Capel bought the hosts enough time to avoid defeat. Capel was eventually caught at slip by Taylor off Lawson, and Russell joined Smith who had brought up his half century. He finished not out on 77.|$|E

5000|$|Reasoning {{sometimes}} changes how <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to us. But {{there is}} also a way <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to us prior to reasoning; otherwise, reasoning could not get started. The way <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> prior to reasoning we may call an 'initial appearance'. An initial, intellectual appearance is an 'intuition'. That is, an intuition that p is a state of its seeming to one that p that is not dependent on inference from other beliefs and that results from thinking about p, as opposed to perceiving, remembering, or introspecting. An ethical intuition is an intuition whose content is an evaluative proposition. (§5.2) ...|$|R

25|$|However, {{seeing as}} the second innings did not start for England until the fourth day a result seemed unlikely. Strauss made up for his first effort by making a 128 but little else from the team was worth mention as they {{declared}} a few overs into the last day, leaving the tourists with a deficit of 379 to chase in 73 overs. After Salman Butt fell from the first delivery to Hoggard, <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> hopeful, even more so after Imran Farhat fell at 33 but Faisal Iqbal's slow, but firm scoring rate took them to before tea, leaving Inzy and Abdul Razzaq to bat out the last session for 73 before a draw was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The Greed Killing EP was {{the next}} release from the band, through Earache. After the preview with the EP, Diatribes, a {{full-length}} album was released. Although <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going smoothly from outside, they were going through problems. Misunderstanding arose between the members and singer Greenway was expelled from the band in late/mid 1996. Greenway went to record with Extreme Noise Terror (the ENT release Damage 381 features Barney on lead vocals) and ENT's main singer Phil Vane went to fill vocals slot in Napalm Death. Things did not go {{as well as they}} were supposed to, and Vane was kicked out of the band just before they got into the studio to record the new album. And so Greenway returned to Napalm Death.|$|E
25|$|Barlow {{returned}} {{the second half}} kickoff 58 yards to the Broncos 27, setting up Jags kicker Mike Hollis' 38-yard field goal that cut the score to 21-10. Four minutes later, safety Travis Davis blocked a punt from Denver's Tom Rouen and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, bringing Jacksonville to within 21-17. Despite a 51-yard kickoff return by Vaughn Hebron, <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to look even better for Jacksonville on the ensuing possession when safety Chris Hudson forced a fumble from Elway that was recovered by defensive end Renaldo Wynn. Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell's subsequent 37-yard completion to tight end Damon Jones gave them a first down on the Broncos 16-yard line. But on the next play, Brunell lost a fumble of his own that was recovered by linebacker Allen Aldridge. Denver then drove to the Jacksonville 15, featuring a 59-yard run by Davis, but Elway lost another fumble that was recovered by cornerback Dave Thomas and the score remained 21-17 going into the fourth quarter.|$|E

25|$|In early 2009, French forces {{embarked}} on a significant campaign which aimed to retake an eastern Alasay District that the Taliban has controlled for the previous year. Alasay district is a strategic goldmine: it lies along a primary infiltration route {{into and out of}} Pakistan, it provides easy access to Kabul in an easily defensible primary valley (there are two other valleys in Alasay District), and it is mostly populated by the ethnic minority the Pashai and some Nuristani. In a French-led NATO force initiated, the operation was a success initially, due to reaching out to locals beforehand, they retook the entire valley with a single casualty over a single day of fighting. Almost immediately, the Afghans of the valley welcomed the French, and <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to be looking up. However, they didn’t stay. Much as in previous efforts to “sweep” the province, the French were dragged into other tasks, like protecting the main highway that travels the province from north to south through the volatile Tagab Valley. As a result, Alasay fell back to Taliban later that year and the security situation in the province deteriorated. It was that same tug-of-war all over again, with the residents of Alasay left frustrated and less safe than ever before. As 2009 progressed, bigger and bigger chunks of the province came under the sway of the insurgency, leading the provincial capital being more or less under curfew from the militants. By 2010, the French had stopped liaising with their Afghan Army counterparts, and the Provincial Reconstruction Team had ceased most of its operations.|$|E
25|$|Off {{the field}} issues {{continued}} to overshadow the team, although initially <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to have pacified when former manager Walter Smith was appointed {{as chairman of}} the Plc board in May, however, he lasted less than two months before resigning. Smith's departure coincided with the return of former Chief executive Charles Green in a consultant capacity. Green became embroiled in a row with Rangers manager Ally McCoist after her suggested that McCoist had to win a cup as well as League One that season to save his job. Ultimately, Greens influence was seen to be more damaging than positive and he agreed to resign his position and sell his remaining shares in the club to Sandy Easdale. A second former board member, Imran Ahmad, also sold his remaining shares in the club as it was reported he was preparing to sue the club for £3.4m in unpaid bonus money. Meanwhile, a group of Rangers shareholders, led by former director Paul Murray, requisitioned an EGM to vote on the removal of Plc board directors including chief executive Craig Mather. This was partly the result of shareholders being concerned over Mather's £500,000 annual salary. The Rangers board opening negotiations with the requisitioners in late August to delay the EGM and combine it with AGM business and after prolonged and fictitious meetings the requisitioners withdrew the request for an EGM. Nevertheless, the requisitioners were not to be deterred and wrote to Rangers with a proposal to have four new directors appointed at the AGM, however the board failed to put this motion on the agenda forcing the requisitioners to seek an interim interdict in order for a new agenda to be sent out thus delaying the AGM.|$|E
500|$|The {{focus of}} most reviews {{was in the}} climactic final scene, whose {{directing}} and acting is universally acclaimed by critics. Writing for Cultural Learnings, Myles McNutt stated: [...] "the final shot, with Arya looking to the sky as everything goes to silence and all she sees is the birds flying was just wonderfully haunting. Alan Taylor's direction sold both the chaos and the resignation of that moment." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall felt that [...] "that final scene was so gorgeously shot, and the weariness of Bean's performance and the horror of Maisie Williams' so perfectly conveyed the emotions of it, even as <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> so chaotic." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 19, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Liev Schreiber would play the role of Ted Winter, Evelyn Salt's friend and colleague in the CIA. [...] Three days later Chiwetel Ejiofor named as CIA Officer Peabody, who is in pursuit of Salt. Noyce said Ejiofor, whom he first saw in Dirty Pretty <b>Things,</b> <b>seemed</b> to have the [...] "intelligence and disarming sort of obsessiveness" [...] that a counter-intelligence officer would need. August Diehl, who played Salt's husband Mike Krause, came after a recommendation from Jolie's partner Brad Pitt, who had worked with Diehl in Inglourious Basterds, and Daniel Olbrychski was chosen for Orlov because Andrei Konchalovsky told Noyce that such an evil Russian character could only be played by a Polish actor.|$|E
500|$|The {{lifetime}} of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (17591797) encompassed {{most of the}} second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: [...] "few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race." ...|$|E
500|$|Although <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to start}} off smoothly, when {{construction}} began on the bridge in 1834, things went downhill. The bridge was constructed fast, and when completed {{in the spring of}} 1836, it was a wooden covered bridge at a length of [...] Within days of opening the bridge, on April 9, 1836, a storm blew through the valley, destroying two of the bridges three piers and rendered the new bridge unusable. After restarting construction later, the bridge was redone using the same piers and in 1839, was completed and opened once again. However, in January 1841, another storm, dubbed the Bridges Freshet of January 1841, blew through the valley, destroying most of the bridges in the area, and causing major damage to the structure from Riverton to Belvidere. However, this time, the bridge survived the storm. A local historian stated that because of the constant repairwork on the bridge itself, the bridge company had never paid one dividend of money to its stockholders. Although, after society {{on both sides of the}} bridge began to live life with it, money started flowing into the accounts of the stockholders.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, {{there is no such thing}} as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale).

60|$|For most {{practical}} purposes {{these differences are}} unimportant, but to the painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to have the colour which common sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have already the beginning {{of one of the}} distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be and what they are. The painter wants to know what <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be, the practical man and the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.|$|R

500|$|By late 1637, the {{conclusion}} of the controversy was beginning to take shape. [...] During the court held in early November, Wheelwright was finally sentenced to banishment, the delay caused by the hopes that he would, at some point, recant. [...] On 7 November the trial of Anne Hutchinson began, and Wilson was there with most of the other ministers in the colony, though his role was somewhat restrained. [...] During {{the second day of the}} trial, when <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going in her favor, Hutchinson insisted on making a statement, admitting that her knowledge of things had come from a divine inspiration, prophesying her deliverance from the proceedings, and announcing that a curse would befall the colony. [...] This was all that her judges needed to hear, and she was accused of heresy and sentenced to banishment, though she would be held in detention for four months, awaiting a trial by the clergy. [...] While no statements made by Wilson were recorded in either existing transcript of this trial, Wilson did make a speech against Hutchinson at the end of the proceedings, to which Hutchinson responded with anger four months later during her church trial.|$|E

2500|$|Though <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{be getting}} better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's {{demeanor}} onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called [...] "endless tour"—the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions—had taken its toll.|$|E

2500|$|The 2012 {{season began}} with several {{changes to the}} club. Oscar Pareja was {{appointed}} head coach following the departure of Gary Smith. [...] The team traded Sanna Nyassi to the Montreal Impact, and Macoumba Kandji to Houston Dynamo. Acquiring Hunter Freeman, Jaime Castrillón, Luis Zapata, and young Kamani Hill and the loan of young talent Martín Rivero the Rapids looked to begin on a positive note. After defeating the Columbus Crew 2–0 on opening day, <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> promising. However, as the season ticked by, things started to turn for the worst. Looking for a turn around, Hárrison Henao was loaned and Brazilian Edu was signed. In July, Kosuke Kimura {{was traded to the}} Portland Timbers. Shortly after, defender Tyson Wahl was brought in via trade from the Montreal Impact. After a poor season, the Rapids looked for a late season turn around when they signed Hendry Thomas from Wigan Athletic. The Rapids were eliminated from play-off contention in late September ending hopes for another MLS cup.|$|E
2500|$|With new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers {{moving into}} the CoreStates Center, <b>things</b> <b>seemed</b> to finally be heading in a {{positive}} direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22–60 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996–97 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by [...] "playing the right way", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997–98. Early in the 1997–98 season, the Sixers traded Jerry Stackhouse, {{who had been the}} third overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft, to the Detroit Pistons. In exchange, Philadelphia received Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff, defensive standouts who would have an impact in the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, Eric Snow, was added in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics in January 1998.|$|E
