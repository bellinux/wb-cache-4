40|$|Noteworthy {{results have}} been {{obtained}} in the turning and drilling of hardened high-strength steels using tungsten carbide based cutting tools. In a finish turning process, it was seen that surface roughness and tool flank wear followed very different trends against cutting time. The suggested explanation for this behaviour is that the profile cut into the workpiece surface {{is determined by the}} tool's cutting edge profile. It is shown that the profile appearing on the cut surface changes rapidly over time, so the profile of the tool cutting edge should also be changing rapidly. Workpiece material adhered onto the cutting tool, which is also known as a built-up edge, is a phenomenon which could explain the observations made. In terms of tool damage modes, workpiece material adhesion is believed to have contributed to tool wear in examples provided from finish <b>turning,</b> <b>thread</b> <b>turning</b> and drilling.

By <b>turning</b> <b>threads</b> into processes, leveraging virtual memory protection, and imposing a sequential commit protocol, Grace provides programmers with the appearance of deterministic, sequential execution, while taking advantage of available processing cores to run code concurrently and efficiently.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the roller and screw threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section outline. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in mechanical engineering development is the constant improvement of load capacity of machines, mechanisms, units and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also true for today’s most prospective planetary rollerscrew mechanisms (PRSM) converting motion from rotary to linear type. The problem of PRSM load capacity improvement deserves more attention, because these mechanisms have very high performance characteristics, which leads to problems in the choice of support devices for these mechanisms. However, for many mechanical engineering industries it is important to decrease the PRSMs weight and dimensions, or to improve their reliability and durability. This has led to finding the reserves for improving the PRSM load capacity by decreasing the <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> profile angle, α, of PRSM threaded parts, as compared to α = 90 ° in traditional mechanisms. When PRSM calculation methods were developed, it was decided to use α = 90 ° for transforming the mechanism parts into a physical model and a design pattern. It allowed us to reduce the PRSM designing to well-known roller bearing designing based on very extensive experimental data. Proposed PRSM designs do not contradict to accepted physical models and design patterns – they just have different basic characteristics of PRSM, i. e. static and dynamic load ratings. Proposed PRSM designs with a <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> profile angle α= 70 ° on their parts allow to increase the load capacity by 15 %, as compared to traditional PRSMs, which have threaded parts with a <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> profile angle α = 90 °. There are two factors, which can improve the PRSM load capacity. The first one is the decrease of normal force between mating <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> of a screw and a roller with the same operational axial force. The second one is the increase of the radius of the shaped profile of a roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> resulting in the expansion of the contact area pattern between the mating <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> of a screw and a roller. The first factor dominates here. For implementing the proposed PRSM designs into production, one has to explore additionally the effect of α-angle on linkage parameters, process requirements and specific features of the initial contact between the mating <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> of a screw and a roller. </p...|$|R

40|$|Currently, the {{composite}} materials (CM) {{are widely used}} in the aerospace technology and mechanical engineering where the key parameters characterizing structural components and articles are related to their weight characteristics {{as well as their}} performance under high temperatures. For the experimental investigation of composite-based threaded items, the rod-based 3 Dreinforced carbon-carbon composite material (CCCM) was chosen. The subject of the research was the metric thread. The test samples were cut of the aforesaid material along one of the reinforcement direction. The following thread sizes were analyzed: М 24 × 1. 5; М 24 × 2; М 24 × 3. Dependence of the thread strength on the number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> was determined within the range of 1 to 10 <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> for М 24 × 2 thread size. The remaining test samples were used to obtain the relationship between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. The obtained dependence of the thread load bearing capacity on the number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> showed the following: a) An increment in the thread load bearing capacity decreases with increasing number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> However, this effect is less pronounced than that observed for the metal ‘screw/nut’ pair. b) With the CCCM material under study, it proved to be impossible to test configurations having only 1 or 2 <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> c) The wide confidence range (CR) of the failure load {{can be explained by the}} fact that the material under study features an apparent structural heterogeneity, with a different probability of hitting a unit cell of the matrix and filler of the material. Nevertheless, the confidence range is stable, thus indicating indirectly the possibility of using this test method for further study of composite-based threaded items. There is an explicit correlation between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. Increase in the thread strength with increasing thread pitch depends on the relationship between the pitch size and the characteristic size of the unit cell of the material. The test research has shown that it is possible to make CCCM-based screw joints designed for operation under high temperatures as an alternative for metal screw joints, provided that the key parameters such as the thread profile, pitch, diameter and the number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> are properly chosen. </p...|$|R

30|$|As {{a result}} of {{continuous}} changes in business environment and uncertainty of demand and production processes, manufacturing industries are having to develop and evolve rapidly. Therefore, in the future, the production system should be flexible and {{able to respond to}} factor alterations quickly. The system should create high quality products, support small production volumes and meet all needs of customer specifications. Modern production systems consist of high-performance technology and equipment, which increase production capacity. However, at the same time, the system operations become more sophisticated and complex. Manufacturing processes involve inputs from various departments including management, production, finance, marketing, and engineering etc. Hence, the created production system should be able to allow relevant departments to influence the manufacturing operations conveniently and effectively. The production system should consist of the following three components of inputs including manpower, raw materials, machines, energy, money and information; processes including preparation of materials, assembly of all components into various shapes as well as packaging for distribution and outputs including products or outputs in the form of goods or services. Turning is a basic process that is commonly used in various industries. The operation involves rotating the work-piece while moving a cutting tool linearly toward the work-piece to improve the work-piece. Turning can cut or decrease the size of a work-piece by removing external surface with a cutting tool positioned vertically to its rotating axis. Types of turning methods include facing, straight <b>turning,</b> <b>thread</b> <b>turning,</b> boring, necking and parting.

40|$|Cantilever epitaxy (CE) {{has been}} {{developed}} to produce GaN on sapphire with low dislocation densities as needed for improved devices. The basic mechanism of seeding growth on sapphire mesas and lateral growth of cantilevers until they coalesce has been modified with an initial growth step at 950 C. This step produces a gable with (11 {bar 2 } 2) facets over the mesas, which <b>turns</b> <b>threading</b> dislocations from vertical to horizontal {{in order to reduce}} the local density above mesas. This technique has produced material with densities as low as 2 - 3 x 10 {sup 7 }/cm{sup 2 } averaged across extended areas of GaN on sapphire, as determined with AFM, TEM and cathodoluminescence (CL). This density is about two orders of magnitude below that of conventional planar growths; these improvements suggest that locating wide-area devices across both cantilever and mesa regions is possible. However, the first implementation of this technique also produced a new defect: cracks at cantilever coalescences with associated arrays of lateral dislocations. These defects have been labeled 'dark-block defects' because they are non-radiative and appear as dark rectangles in CL images. Material has been grown that does not have dark-block defects. Examination of the evolution of the cantilever films for many growths, both partial and complete, indicates that producing a film without these defects requires careful control of growth conditions and crystal morphology at multiple steps.

40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction of included angle of ERSM threaded parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact of the conjugated <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change of included angle of threaded parts of the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which roller thread profile has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack of sharp <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> on the screw, rollers and nut; <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> of roller with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> of roller with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features. Concurrently, possible wear out of threaded surfaces of ERSM parts is taken into account. </p...|$|R
