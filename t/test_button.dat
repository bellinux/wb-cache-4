25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated <b>test</b> <b>button</b> simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional.

30|$|For this test, {{as well as}} all the {{listening}} tests employed for the results of this manuscript (both ABX and DCR tests explained in the following paragraphs), the sound level of all waveforms was normalized so that they sound as having equal level (or else the loudness level could have affected the results). This normalization was achieved by dividing each signal with its maximum absolute value, and in practice this procedure proved to be sufficient for all signals to sound as having the same sound level; the reader is referred to the authors' website mentioned in Section 5.2 for listening to the audio waveforms that were used in {{the listening}} tests. For both the ABX and DCR tests, a simple computer-based graphical user interface (GUI) was designed for the convenience of the listeners.

50|$|Modern {{emergency}} lighting is installed {{in virtually every}} commercial and high occupancy residential building. The lights consist {{of one or more}} incandescent bulbs or one or more clusters of high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED). The {{emergency lighting}} heads are usually either PAR 36 sealed beams or wedge base lamps. All units have some sort of a device to focus and intensify the light they produce. This can either be {{in the form of a}} plastic cover over the fixture, or a reflector placed behind the light source. Most individual light sources can be rotated and aimed for where light is needed most in an emergency, such as toward fire exits. Modern fixtures usually have a <b>test</b> <b>button</b> of some sort which temporarily overrides the unit and causes it to switch on the lights and operate from battery power even if the main power is still on. Modern systems are operated with relatively low voltage, usually from 6-12 volts. This both reduces the size of the batteries required and reduces the load on the circuit to which the emergency light is wired. Modern fixtures include a small transformer in the base of the fixture which steps-down the voltage from main current to the low voltage required by the lights. Batteries are commonly made of lead-calcium, and can last for 10 years or more on continuous charge. U.S. fire safety codes require a minimum of 90 minutes on battery power during a power outage along the path of egress.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} reports 832 {{telephone}} interviews {{during the spring}} of 1984 with persons from two insurance companies in the same geographical area. In the fall of 1982 one of the insurance companies started to distribute a free smoke detector to all of its customers. The other insurance company served as a control and comparison group for studying the effects of a free smoke detector on installation and reliability. The population in each insurance company was strati fed into two insurance policy groups, and crossed with three age groups. Random samples of approx equal sizes were drawn. Around 94 percent of the persons in the samples were actually reached, and the interview about installation and reliability ended with a request to press the <b>test</b> <b>button</b> of the smoke detector. The net effect of sending out a free smoke detector is more pronounced with household policy holders, although home policy holders more often have a smoke detector installed. There is no general tendency that people who have bought a smoke detector take better care of it, maintain it better, install it in the right place more often, check it more often, or make it operate properly more often than those who have got a free smoke detector. However, for old people the free smoke detector has been out of working order more often than for young people. Any such effect of a free smoke detector is not more pronounced with those who have a household insurance policy than with those who have a home insurance policy. Nor is there any such effect of age group. It should be noted that around 16 percent of the smoke detectors that are reported by their owners to be in working condition, do not respond to the test-button being pressed...|$|E

40|$|Walking {{performance}} {{changes with}} age. This {{has implications for}} the problem of falls in older adults. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of Yuanji-Dance practice on walking balance and the associated attention demand in healthy elderly. Fifteen community-dwelling elderly (comparison group, no regular exercise habit) and fifteen Yuanji- Dance elderly (exercise group, dancing experience: 5. 40 ± 1. 95 years), aged 60 - 70 years, were included in this study. The subjects in exercise group participated in a 90 -minute Yuanji-Dance practice at least three times per week and the comparison group continued their normal daily physical activity. Walking balance measures (including walking velocity, step length, step width, and percentage of time spent in double limb support, COM velocity and COM-COP inclination angles) and attentional demand <b>tests</b> (<b>button</b> reaction time and accuracy) were conducted under different conditions. Our results showed that stride lengths, walking velocities, peak A/P velocities (AP V) of the COM, medial COM-COP inclination (M angle) angles, reaction time, and accuracy decrease significantly as the dual-task (walking plus hand button pressing tasks) applied for either the comparison or exercise groups. These results demonstrated that walking performance is attenuated in our elderly participants as the cognitive tasks applied. Analysis also identified a significantly faster RT for our exercise group both in standing and walking conditions. This may indicate that physical exercise (Yuanji-Dance) may have facilitating effects on general cognitive and perceptual- motor functions. This implies that Chinese Yuanji-Dance practice for elderly adults may improve their personal safety when walking especially under the condition of multiple task deman...|$|R

The <b>tested</b> <b>button</b> was made from Copper no. 110, cold drawn rod, which has a documented yield stress value of 48, 000 psi. The button was put into compression with the load applied to the face of the button. The resulting deflection vs. the applied cross load was then charted with the width of the chart having a 10, 000 kg scale. While the chart speed was set at 1 cm/min, the cross head speed was set at. 05 cm/min.

Here, the slope of the curve began to change, increasing over a small area until a new linear curve was established. The point at which the slope changed would be considered the yielding point of the material, but here, there was no single distinct point. Instead there was a smooth transition between the two linear portions of the curve. In order to find where the yield point would occur, two lines were drawn, representing the best fit of each of the two slopes of the curve (before and after the yield point).

Furthermore, the wear and degradation of the buttons have been categorized. Buttons with cobalt binder were tested against granite and sandstone and buttons with alternative binders (Ni, Fe, Co) were tested against granite. Cobalt buttons were used as a reference and the wear and friction of the alternative binders was compared to the reference. The amount of worn rock was also measured. Furthermore, post treated drill bit buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co were compared to buttons with the same composition {{that had not been}} post treated The results show that buttons with an alternative composition of Fe-Co-Ni and Fe- Ni wears less than the cobalt reference. The post treatment process does not decrease the wear of the drill bit but lowers the deviation from the mean wear. The amount of worn rock does not differ between the samples except for between the post treated and not post treated buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co. The post treated buttons produces more rock debris than the not post treated.

40|$|Automotive {{infotainment}} {{systems are}} automotive equipment manufactured with narrow tolerances. Besides the hardware itself, the components that {{interact with the}} user and {{with the rest of}} the car have to fulfil strict requirements. These components are the buttons face plate and the pins connector. The buttons must fulfil haptics requirements of force and stroke in order that the feeling of pressing them would be the same as the rest car buttons’ feeling. The pins connector must fulfil force requirements in order that ergonomic and resistance characteristics would be achieved. These characteristics must be measured to verify whether the prototypes are within required tolerances in order to produce the infotainment system model. Developing a test device to check the force and stroke characteristics of infotainment systems is the aim of this project. Having its own forcestroke test device in the Panasonic headquarter in Langen would speed up the process of verification and modification of the infotainment systems prototypes and would simplify the design task. To develop the suitable test device required, the characteristics of both kind of test have been taken into account. The <b>button</b> <b>test</b> and the pins connector tests have very different requirements. On one hand, the <b>button</b> <b>test</b> requires high resolution, accuracy and repeatability and its range of force is from 0 N to 10 N. On the other hand, the pins connector tests require applying higher force, from - 125 N to 450 N, being negative for pulling and positive for pushing. Moreover, these kinds of tests do not require sensors resolution and accuracy as high as those for the <b>button</b> <b>test.</b> Taking into account these requirements, a stable and stiff test device with an actuator, two force sensors and a displacement sensor has been developed. The simplicity of the device was a necessity due to the stability and the low cost required. Apart from the design and development of the test device, the application interface has also programmed, using LabVIEW software. The software for controlling and getting the result of the <b>button</b> <b>test</b> has already been developed and is totally functional. However, the software of the pins connector tests will be the next tasks to achieve. Although the repeatability of the test device is acceptable, its accuracy must be tested by a certification company, in order to validate the test device performance. To sum up, this test device has been a good inversion. Panasonic has got a low cost test device with which the company will save money, the infotainment systems will not be tested by an external company, and time, the test device will speed up the verification and modification process of prototypes...|$|R
