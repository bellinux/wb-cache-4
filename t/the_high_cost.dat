5|$|The lower {{power house}} also {{underwent}} major rehabilitation measures. It {{was shut down}} in December 1974 due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of operation and maintenance. In 1984 a new power plant was built adjoining the old powerhouse, with installation of 6.7 MW capacity.|$|E
5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> was anticipated, as organizers were aware {{at the outset of}} their bid that most facilities would have to be constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E
5|$|Hounds of Love was {{released}} in 1985. Because of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.

Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E

Cost estimates for hosting the game were close to $1 million. Unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic, the league did not run the event, meaning the Crunch had to finance the entire project. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of hosting was a reason for other franchises not pursuing outdoor games prior.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands {{in order to prevent}} further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} set up {{a second}} committee in 1968 who suggested that the old eastwest runway be closed and the airport's area reduced, allowing for development {{to the east of}} the airport. They suggested that this is replaced by a new runway in the sea, adjacent to the beach. The runway was closed, and a high density upper-middle income neighborhood was built to the east of the airport, although the new runway was never constructed due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> involved.|$|E

5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of some Zinfandels.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of the aircraft, a lack {{of clear}} air-to-air {{missions}} due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on exports, {{and development of the}} more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production. A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009, and the last F-22 was delivered to the USAF in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose.

5|$|The {{remnant of}} the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would connect with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan's West Side.

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during {{the whole of the}} 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
