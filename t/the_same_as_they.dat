5|$|In the 1997 general election, {{the party}} stood over fifty candidates. Tyndall {{stood in the}} East London {{constituency}} of Poplar and Canning Town, where he received 7.26% of the vote. Tyndall claimed that following the election, the party received between 2,500 and 3,000 enquiries—roughly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had received after the 1983 general election—although far fewer of these enquirers became members.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are in ski jumping, and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested {{as part of}} the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but the hills (of which there are only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E

5|$|Just like {{individual}} competitions, {{there are}} two rounds, but with a difference. Each round is divided into four rotations or 'legs', in which a member of every team jumps once in the same order. Points are scored <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are in individual competitions; however, an athlete's points for a jump are instead added to their team's total tally. The starting order of teams in the first round, and first three legs of the second round, is based on their standings in the Nations Cup. Teams are narrowed down to eight for the second round based on points scored, with the same four athletes jumping in their order of rotation as before.|$|E
5|$|The {{frontiers of}} the Principality of Albania {{had not been}} set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they {{had not yet been}} {{determined}} by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, {{in the northern part of}} the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} {{at the end of that}} episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E

25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of {{discrete}} mathematics, a distance-hereditary graph (also called a completely separable graph) is a graph in which the distances in any connected induced subgraph are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are in the original graph.

25|$|Likewise, in the Mycenaean Greek Linear B tablets, some Homeric names appear, {{including}} Achilles (Linear B: , a-ki-re-u), a name {{which was}} also common in the classical period, noted on tablets from both Knossos and Pylos. The Achilles of the Linear B tablet is a shepherd, not a king or warrior, but {{the very fact that}} the name is an authentic Bronze Age name is significant. These names in the Homeric poems presumably remember, if not necessarily specific people, at least an older time when people's names were not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were when the Homeric epics were written down. Some story elements from the tablets appear in the Iliad.|$|E
25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers should be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm {{if and only if}} power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current draw of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E

25|$|Iowa {{started the}} second half with the ball but they would punt the ball to Wisconsin after three plays. Wisconsin would do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> punted the ball back to Iowa. The Hawkeyes drive {{the ball to the}} Badgers 35-yard line. On fourth-and-one, Iowa decided to go for it and failed as the Badgers defense stuffed the run up the middle. Still the Badgers {{struggled}} to move the ball on the Iowa defense and punted it back to the Hawkeyes. The Wisconsin punt was downed at the Iowa 1-yard line. On the first play, Iowa tried to pass out of their own end zone. The pass was intercepted by CB Darius Hillary at the Iowa 20-yard line. During that play Iowa starting QB Jake Rudock was injured and would not return to the game. On the very next play, Joel Stave connected with WR Jared Abbrederis on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Jared Abbrederis was injured on the touchdown catch and he would not return to the game. Iowa's backup QB C.J. Beathard would come in but failed to pick up a first down so they punted. Wisconsin tried to move the ball but two holding penalties forced them to punt. Wisconsin punting into the wind again forced a 23-yard punt and Iowa took over at their own 40-yard line. Iowa would again get into the red zone at the Wisconsin 12-yard line but once again they were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal. Wisconsin would have the ball as the third quarter came to a close with the Badgers holding onto a slight 14–9 lead. The Badgers got to midfield put punted the ball back to the Hawkeyes. The Badgers would get pressure on the Iowa backup QB and forced a bad throw that hit off an Iowa helmet, popped {{up in the air and}} was intercepted by DE Pat Muldoon at the Iowa 25-yard line. Three plays later, RB James White scored on an 11-yard touchdown run. The Badgers defense would again force another Hawkeye punt. Wisconsin took over at their own 24-yard line and on the second play of the drive, James White broke loose for a 59-yard run down to the Iowa 17. The Iowa defense tried to hold Wisconsin but finally James White punched it in with a 2-yard touchdown run giving the Badgers a 28–9 lead. With about and three and a half minutes left in the game, Iowa would again drive into the Wisconsin red zone but failed on fourth down and the Badgers closed out the game with a kneel down.|$|E

500|$|In November 1788, {{a second}} Assembly of Notables was convened by Jacques Necker, to {{consider}} {{the makeup of the}} next Estates-General.

The notables rejected the [...] "dual representation" [...] proposal. Louis Stanislas was the only notable to vote to increase the size of the Third Estate. Necker disregarded the notables' judgment, and convinced Louis XVI to grant the extra representation– Louis duly obliged on 27 December.|$|E

The reviewer further criticized the graphics for looking <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were {{in the first game}} of the series, saying that they could only be considered [...] "good" [...] during the release of that game. GameZone said that the game looks exactly the same as the original Knights of the Old Republic, and that it doesn't compare to the majority of mainstream games released at the time. GameSpy called the music in the game [...] "excellent"; however, the reviewer noted that some of it is re-used from {{the first game of the}} series. The GameSpy reviewer also said that while the majority of the voice-acting is good, there are [...] "a few more examples of bad voice-acting" [...] than in the first Knights of the Old Republic. GameZone said that the [...] "top-notch" [...] voice acting complements the game's very well-written dialogue, and also praised the game's sound effects.|$|E

The Doctor is furious, not only at having to choose between saving humanity or the Whale, but also at Amy for trying to keep him from making that choice. The Doctor decides to make the Whale brain-dead, allowing it to continuing travelling. As the Doctor starts the process, Amy observes Mandy has found her friend, unharmed. She forces Liz 10 to hit the abdicate control; to everyone's surprise, the Whale continues travelling, at a faster speed. Amy posits that like the Doctor, the Whale had come to Earth willingly to help save the remaining children, and is helping Starship UK.|$|E
