40|$|Aims: Effectiveness of {{radioiodine}} for Graves’ hyperthyroidism (GD) {{depends on}} its intrathyroidal persistence, which could be enhanced by lithium by blocking the release of organic iodine and thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland. The present aim focused {{on the effect of}} the addition of lithium carbonate to 131 I therapy in patients with GD. Methods: 100 consecutive patients with GD were randomly assigned to two groups: group (A) patients treated with 131 I and group (B) patients treated with 131 I plus lithium carbonate. Patients in B group were treated with a dose of 0. 5 g per day (2 × 0. 25 g) of lithium carbonate for half a month before and after the administration of 131 I. Thyroid weight was estimated by ultrasonography and careful palpation of the thyroid. Radiation absorbed dose rate {{in the front of the}} neck was measured on days 1530 and 45 after the administration of 131 I. Serum concentrations of thyroidstimu lation hormone (TSH), fee tri-iodothyrosine (T 3) and free thyroxine (T 4) were tested on days 30, 45, 90, 180 before and after treatment. Results: After RIT, radiation absorbed dose rate in the front of neck gradually decreased as time went on (p 0. 05), free T 3 and free T 4 values in both groups rose significantly one month after treatment (all p 0. 05). Cure rate of hyperthyr oidism was achieved in 36 of the 50 patie nts (72 %) treated with 131 I alone and in 38 of the 50 patients (76 %) treated with 131 I plus lithium. Conclusion: We suggest that for patients withdrawing of ATD and those with short effective half-time, as well as those intolerant or invalid, the short term addition of lithium to 131 I allows for a better control of <b>thyrotoxia</b> and the completeness of treatment. </b...|$|E
