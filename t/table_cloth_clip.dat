30|$|The along-strike maximum {{compression}} {{observed in}} sectors 2, 3, and 4 (top 90 km) {{can be explained}} by the “tablecloth effect” or membrane strain model (e.g., Creager et al., 1995). According to this model, the slab geometry is analogous to a <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> draped over the corner of a table, producing a slab with too much material (pleats in the <b>table</b> <b>cloth)</b> to fit around the corner, developing compressive along-strike membrane strains or geometric buckling. More data are needed in terms of precise earthquake locations and moment tensor solutions in order to shed light on the finer details of the slab’s geometry and stress variations along the Hellenic arc.|$|R

25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|R
