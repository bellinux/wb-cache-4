5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. <b>The</b> <b>significant</b> reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010 outdoor season, Gay ran a new 400m best time of 44.89seconds.

5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of}} its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> fortifications in the harbour area, {{the rest}} of the islands {{remained}} mostly undefended until the 17th century, and they were prone to attacks (such as the raid of 1551).

2500|$|In big-endian format, {{whenever}} addressing {{memory or}} sending/storing words bytewise, <b>the</b> most <b>significant</b> byte — <b>the</b> byte containing <b>the</b> most <b>significant</b> bit — is stored first (has the lowest address) or sent first, then the following bytes are stored or sent in decreasing significance order, with <b>the</b> least <b>significant</b> byte — <b>the</b> one containing <b>the</b> least <b>significant</b> bit — stored last (having the highest address) or sent last. Little-endian format reverses this order: the sequence addresses/sends/stores <b>the</b> least <b>significant</b> byte first (lowest address) and <b>the</b> most <b>significant</b> byte last (highest address). Most computer systems prefer a single format {{for all its}} data; using the system's native format is automatic. But when reading memory or receiving transmitted data from a different computer system, it is often required to process and translate data between the preferred native endianness format to the opposite format.|$|R
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> {{loss of life}} {{caused by}} the storm, the name Lucille was retired.

5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Grainger left Australia {{at the age}} of 13 {{to attend}} the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt.

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet.

Others argue that <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship.
