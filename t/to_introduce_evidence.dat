25|$|On February 3, {{the panel}} allowed Coleman <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that as many}} as 4,800 {{absentee}} ballots were wrongly rejected and should now be counted. The Franken campaign had tried to limit Coleman to bringing evidence on only the 650 absentee ballots cited in the initial court filing.|$|E
25|$|At the {{sentencing}} phase, the judge allowed {{both the public}} defender to adduce mitigating testimony from the defendant's friends and family, and the district attorney (DA) <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> from the grandmother/mother of the victims. Payne appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, and then asked for a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court. Certiorari was granted, with the Court noting {{that it would have}} to reconsider its past precedent. The case was argued on April 24, 1991 and decided on June 27, 1991.|$|E
25|$|Day {{five of the}} {{proceedings}} saw conflict as the prosecution again attempted <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that had not been}} shared with both the court and the defense during pre-trial. The defense objected vehemently with defense lawyer Peter Althin equating the tactic to something out of the old Perry Mason TV show. “Suddenly, the door opens and in walks an entirely new witness.” The presiding judge stopped the case to deliberate the matter and found in favor of the defense, instructing the prosecution to immediately hand over all material they planned to use.|$|E
5000|$|A shadow {{defense is}} a legal defense that cannot be {{sustained}} on its own merits but opens the door <b>to</b> <b>introducing</b> <b>evidence</b> that will assist in seeking jury nullification, and gives the jury an excuse to acquit. A [...] "shadow defense" [...] also may refer to a tactic by defending counsel that {{is not expected to}} be successful as a matter of law; it is, instead, a pretext for bringing information into the court that would otherwise be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{while working}} for the Ramsey County Attorney's office, {{she became the first}} Minnesota {{prosecutor}} <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> DNA <b>evidence</b> in court. Later, as Ramsey County Attorney, Gaertner established programs designed to curb domestic violence.|$|R
50|$|A {{minority}} of U.S. jurisdictions, however, permit defendants in {{assault and battery}} and fraudulent misconduct civil cases <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> character <b>evidence</b> as circumstantial evidence to prove that a person acted in conformity {{with his or her}} character.|$|R
25|$|A year later, on January 14, 1992, Wuornos went {{to trial}} {{for the murder of}} Mallory; {{although}} previous convictions are normally inadmissible in criminal trials, under Florida's Williams Rule the prosecution was allowed <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> related to her other crimes to show a pattern of illegal activity. On January 27, 1992, Wuornos was convicted of Mallory's murder with help from Moore's testimony. At her sentencing, psychiatrists for the defense testified that Wuornos was mentally unstable and had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Four days later, she was sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|Statements were {{collected}} from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, {{and that it had}} been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses said there had been two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E
50|$|During {{the trial}} the defense {{presented}} no witnesses, but sought <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> into <b>evidence</b> written statements of Pedro and Henderson. The court denied this request finding the written statements were not inconsistent as alleged by the defense.|$|R

50|$|Kappos v.

2500|$|When Hudgins {{appealed to}} the Virginia Supreme Court after Wythe's murder, all judges {{unanimously}} affirmed Wythe's decision allowing Wright freedom, but only on limited grounds. Wythe's former student St. George Tucker affirmed Wythe's ruling only on the particular and limited nature of Indian enslavement in the state. The other extensive opinion in the case was by Judge Spencer Roane, who contrasted the presumption of freedom for Indians, as well as condemned Hudgins for failing <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> of any black ancestry of those seeking their freedom. Thus, all the appellate judges held that the two-decades old Declaration of Rights {{did not apply to}} blacks. Although Tucker (a slaveholder) rejected this judicial route to freedom, he had written in favor of [...] and continued to fight for emancipation in other political venues.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Coll {{criticized the}} early claims for [...] "journalism" [...] {{with the use}} of {{composite}} characters. He took issue with the film's using the names of historical figures and details of their lives for characters, such as using details for [...] "Ammar" [...] to suggest that he was Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, whose nom de guerre was Ammar al-Baluchi. Coll said the facts about him were different from what was portrayed in the film, which suggests the detainee will never leave the black site. Al-Baluchi was transferred to Guantanamo in 2006 for a military tribunal. Coll writes: He has been an active, defiant participant in Guantánamo court proceedings and his lawyers have sought permission from military judges <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> in his defense that he was tortured while in CIA custody, and to pursue information about the identities of the agency officers who interrogated him.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1992, Wuornos {{pleaded guilty}} {{to the murder of}} Carskaddon; in November 1992, she {{received}} her fifth death sentence. The defense made efforts during the trial <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> that Mallory had been tried for intent to commit rape in Maryland and that he had been committed to a maximum security correctional facility that provided remediation to sexual offenders. Records obtained from that institution reflected that, from 1958 to 1962, Mallory was committed for treatment and observation resulting from a criminal charge of assault with intent to rape and received an over-all eight years of treatment from the facility. In 1961, [...] "it was observed of Mr. Mallory that he possessed strong sociopathic trends". The judge refused to allow this to be admitted in court as evidence and denied Wuornos' request for a retrial. In February 1993, Wuornos {{pleaded guilty to}} the murder of Antonio and was sentenced to death again. No charges were brought against her for the murder of Siems, as his body was never found. In all, she received six death sentences.|$|E
50|$|Ng {{insisted on}} taking {{the stand in}} his own defense, which allowed {{prosecutors}} <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> additional <b>evidence</b> that helped define Ng's role {{in all aspects of}} the crimes. One significant item was a photo of Ng in his prison cell, with cartoons he had sketched of his victims hanging on the wall behind him.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that under}} CEC §1103(c)(1), reputation, opinion, and {{specific}} acts evidence are all barred if defendant seeks <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> the <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> show the sexual {{character of the}} victim, but evidence of the victim's sexual conduct with the defendant—i.e. specific acts—may be used by defendant {{to show that the}} victim consented to the sexual act.|$|R
5000|$|Various commentators, such as Oliver Gayner and Cathryn Hopkins of Olswang's [...] and Thomas G. Heintzman of McCarthy Tétrault have {{suggested}} that parties to such cases may, {{as a result of}} this ruling, seek <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> expert <b>evidence</b> on the precise degree of [...] "commercial reasonableness" [...] that a particular interpretation of a contract would imply.|$|R
50|$|Although Martin's appeals {{centered}} on his arrest and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he also attempted <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> of his innocence.|$|E
50|$|Handy {{was charged}} with sexual assault causing bodily harm. The Crown tried <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> of Handy's history with his ex-wife which {{involved}} seven past sexual assaults on her. The trial judge allowed it.|$|E
50|$|A rape shield {{law is a}} {{law that}} limits a defendant's ability <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> or {{cross-examine}} rape complainants about their past sexual behavior.

50|$|After {{the report}} was published, an appeal was made to the Supreme Court to order the Minister of Health to open an inquiry into the {{evacuation}} {{of the prime minister}} and into the care he received when he reached the hospital. The court dismissed the appeal, stating that the inquiry had been covered by the Shamgar report, and that the appeal failed <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> new <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mansfield {{said she}} doubts Bruce will {{successfully}} complete his probation as Bruce himself {{would show up}} tardy <b>to</b> trial and <b>introduced</b> <b>evidence</b> by throwing documents onto the floor, the judge said. “The defendant has absolutely no regard {{for the rule of}} law. His behavior during trial was reprehensible,”Manfield said.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the past}} century, {{criminal}} {{cases have been}} documented in which a party has sought <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> into <b>evidence</b> information obtained {{through the process of}} hypnosis.

50|$|Where a {{party is}} {{denied the right}} <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>{{evidence}}</b> because that evidence would be inflammatory, hearsay, or would lack sufficient authentication, that party must make a proffer of what the evidence would have shown {{in order to preserve}} the issue for appeal.|$|E

50|$|At {{the hearing}} before the {{commissioner}} of the circuit court, the petitioner offered <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> as to her right to land; and contended that if the Immigration Act of 1891 allowed immigration bureaucrats to make final decisions on such matters {{without the possibility of}} judicial review, it was unconstitutional.|$|E
50|$|Oregon v. Guzek, 546 U.S. 517 (2006), was a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not grant criminal defendants facing the death penalty the right <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> new <b>evidence</b> of their innocence during sentencing that was not introduced during trial. Accordingly, states could constitutionally exclude such evidence from the sentencing phase of a capital trial.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIntravenous {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics {{are widely}} used to treat pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Over the last decade evidence has accumulated showing that the choice of aminoglycoside and the dosing regimen may help reduce adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity. MethodsWe undertook an online survey to determine current practice in UK CF Centres. ResultsWe received a response from 35 / 48 (73 %) centres. A once daily regimen was used in 30 / 35 (86 %) centres. Around one third had stopped using gentamicin in the last 10 years. In most cases respondents reported changing practice in response to new evidence or evidence based guidelines. Obstacles <b>to</b> <b>introducing</b> <b>evidence</b> based practice were identified both {{at the level of}} the CF Centre and the hospital trust. ConclusionsA once daily aminoglycoside regimen is now used in the majority of UK CF Centres. Tobramycin is first line and many centres have stopped using gentamicin. Obstacles to evidence based practice remain in a minority of centres...|$|R

The vacating of her death sentences did not affect her convictions in the case.|$|E
5000|$|The verifiability of {{the best}} {{interest}} standard is hard to achieve. The privacy of family life makes assessing the evidence provided difficult. The best interests standard only worsens the problem, in which both parties are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of the quality of}} their parenting (which also promotes trying to disprove the opposing party’s capabilities of taking the child into custody).|$|E
5000|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, it {{was common}} for the justice system to have suspects tortured to extract confessions from them, since circumstantial evidence was rarely analyzed or admitted in those times.
