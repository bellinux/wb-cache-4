5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E
25|$|The diaphaneity of {{a mineral}} depends on {{thickness}} of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> for petrography), it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as hematite or pyrite are opaque even in thin-section.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{arterial}} wall fixation, staining and <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> {{has been the}} gold standard for detection and description of atheroma, after death and autopsy. With special stains and examination, micro calcifications can be detected, typically within smooth muscle cells of the arterial media near the fatty streaks within a year or two of fatty streaks forming.|$|E

In addition to confirming the observations on <b>thin</b> <b>sections,</b> the freeze-etch technique has revealed the presence in E. gracilis of a complex multilaminar pellicle, and an ordered arrangement to the paramylon granule.

40|$|Abstract Doubly {{polished}} <b>thin</b> <b>sections,</b> originally {{prepared for}} fluid inclusion studies, present great advantages {{in the study}} of microfossils in volcanic rocks. Better visibility and light conditions, variation in thickness of the <b>thin</b> <b>sections</b> and the possibility to combine fluid inclusion studies with microfossil studies lead {{to a wide range of}} advantages over ordinary <b>thin</b> <b>sections.</b> This includes the study of morphology, internal microstructures, colonies, association with the substrate that microfossils are attached to and geological and environmental context in which the microfossil once lived. When meeting the criteria of microfossil recognition the advantages of doubly polished <b>thin</b> <b>sections</b> are substantial and can be crucial in distinguishing between biogenic microfossils and abiotically formed abiomorphs. </p...|$|R

25|$|Refined ultrastructural {{studies by}} TEM showed protein {{occurred}} in a complementary fashion in both cells participating in a gap junction plaque. The gap junction plaque is a relatively large area of membrane observed in TEM <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> and freeze fracture (FF) seen filled with trans-membrane proteins in both tissues and more gently treated gap junction preparations. With the apparent ability for one protein alone to enable intercellular communication seen in gap junctions the term gap junction tended to become synonymous {{with a group of}} assembled connexins though this was not shown in vivo. Biochemical analysis of gap junction rich isolates from various tissues demonstrated a family of connexins.|$|E
25|$|People {{with the}} above {{symptoms}} are commonly studied with computed tomography, or CT scan. The CT scan is very accurate (98%) in diagnosing diverticulitis. In order {{to extract the}} most information possible about the patient's condition, <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> (5mm) transverse images are obtained through the entire abdomen and pelvis after the patient has been administered oral and intravascular contrast. Images reveal localized colon wall thickening, with inflammation extending into the fat surrounding the colon. The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is made confidently when the involved segment contains diverticula. CT may also identify patients with more complicated diverticulitis, such as those with an associated abscess. It may even allow for radiologically guided drainage of an associated abscess, sparing a patient from immediate surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays spins around an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry). Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. Computed tomography has almost completely replaced focal plane tomography in X-ray tomography imaging.|$|E

500|$|The <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> {{technique}} was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting {{the surface of}} a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid. The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50peels can be extracted from [...] of coal ball with this method.|$|E

2500|$|Norwalk virus {{had been}} {{discovered}} by Albert Kapikian using immune electron microscopy and Ruth Bishop and colleagues had seen different particles that they thought were viruses in gut biopsies by <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> electron microscopy. But the preparation of thin sections was too cumbersome for routine use, and Flewett and his co-workers showed that these viruses could be seen by electron microscopy directly in faeces. Flewett and his colleagues in his Birmingham laboratory had observed these viruses in the faeces of sick children before the publication of Ruth Bishop's paper but they failed to realise {{that they were the}} cause of the infection. The virus particles have a wheel-shaped appearance by electron microscopy, and it was Flewett who gave them the name [...] "rotavirus," [...] by which they have been known since. Flewett wrote: ‘At the South Wiltshire Virology Society I met Gerald Woode, then at Compton, in late 1973. He described a virus causing diarrhoea in calves.

2500|$|Ultrastructure and {{biochemistry}} {{of isolated}} gap junctions already referenced had indicated the connexins preferentially group in gap junction plaques or domains and connexins {{were the best}} characterized constituent. It has been noted that the organisation of proteins into arrays with a gap junction plaque may be significant. It is likely this early work was already reflecting the presence of more than just connexins in gap junctions. Combining the emerging fields of freeze-fracture to see inside membranes and immunocytochemistry to label cell components (Freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling or FRIL and <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> immunolabelling) showed gap junction plaques in vivo contained the connexin protein. Later studies using immunofluorescence microscopy of larger areas of tissue clarified diversity in earlier results. Gap junction plaques were confirmed to have variable composition being home to connexon and non-connexin proteins as well making the modern usage of the terms [...] "gap junction" [...] and [...] "gap junction plaque" [...] non-interchangeable. In other words, the commonly used term [...] "gap junction" [...] always refers to a structure that contains connexins while a gap junction plaque may also contain other structural features that will define it.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{allowing}} views {{inside the}} plane of the membrane of gap junctions during formation indicated that a [...] "formation plaque" [...] formed between two cells prior to the connexins moving in. They were particle free areas when observed by TEM FF indicating very small or no transmembrane proteins were likely present. Little is known about what structures make up the formation plaque or how the formation plaque's structure changes when connexins and other components move in or out. One of the earlier studies of the formation of small gap junctions describes rows of particles and particle free halos. With larger gap junctions they were described as formation plaques with connexins moving into them. The particulate gap junctions were thought to form 4–6 hours after the formation plaques appeared. How the connexins may be transported to the plaques using tubulin is becoming clearer. [...] The formation plaque and non-connexin part of the classical gap junction plaque have been difficult for early researchers to analyse. It appears in TEM FF and <b>thin</b> <b>section</b> to be a lipid membrane domain that can somehow form a comparatively rigid barrier to other lipids and proteins. There has been indirect evidence for certain lipids being preferentially involved with the formation plaque but this cannot be considered definitive. It is difficult to envisage breaking up the membrane to analyse membrane plaques without affecting their composition. By study of connexins still in membranes lipids associated with the connexins have been studied. It was found that specific connexins tended to associate preferentially with specific phospholipids. As formation plaques precede connexins these results still give no certainty as to what is unique about the composition of plaques themselves. Other findings show connexins associate with protein scaffolds used in another junction, the zonula occludens ZO1. While this helps us understand how connexins may be moved into a gap junction formation plaque the composition of the plaque itself is still somewhat sketchy. Some headway on the in vivo composition of the gap junction plaque is being made using TEM FRIL.|$|E
