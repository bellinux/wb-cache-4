25|$|The first Vanderbilt women's {{basketball}} game was in March 1897. During that time their schedule consisted of five games which expanded {{as the game}} became more popular nationally. The Lady Commodores began their modern and successful period when Joe Pepper (1977–80) was named part-time coach. Phil Lee (1980–91) became the school's first full-time coach in 1980 and helped lead the Lady Dores to their first 20 win season in 1981 and an appearance in the AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament. The Vanderbilt women captured the WNIT championship in 1984 and later made their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament in 1986 while finishing the season ranked No. 20. The Vanderbilt women soon {{became one of the}} <b>top</b> <b>SEC</b> teams and were consistently ranked nationally. Coach Jim Foster (1992–2002) brought the Vanderbilt women to new heights and national prominence with his hiring. Vanderbilt advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA Tournament in eight of his 11 seasons. In 1993, the Commodores were able to advance to the Final Four before falling to eventual champion Texas Tech. Vanderbilt managed to receive a No.1 ranking in the poll taken before the tournament. Foster's teams also won three SEC Tournaments in 1993, 1995, and 2002. Melanie Balcomb became Vanderbilt's fourth coach in May 2002. She has taken the Commodores to the NCAA Tournament in each of her six seasons and added SEC Tournament titles in 2004 and 2007.|$|E

50|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2012 season the Vols had high hopes for a major turnaround. With {{returning}} star quarterback Tyler Bray back at the helm and star wide receiver Justin Hunter returning from injury the Vols were expected to tout an offense that could compete against the <b>top</b> <b>SEC</b> defenses. Boosting the offense {{from the start of the}} season was the emergence of community college transfer WR Cordarrelle Patterson who became a big threat in both receiving and returning plays. However, another loss to the hated rival Florida Gators, a game in which the Vols were in control for a majority of time, would send the season sinking. The Vols would then lose six of the nine remaining games including a four-game losing streak. A heartbreaking loss to Missouri left many fans fed up with Dooley after a questionable call to play overtime rather than play for a game-winning field goal would deprive the Vols of a victory. A lop-sided loss to in-state rival Vanderbilt would be the final straw. Derek Dooley and the Volunteer football team went 5-7, with all 7 losses being to SEC teams. As a result, Tennessee recorded three consecutive losing seasons (2010, 2011 and 2012). Derek Dooley amassed the worst record of head coaches with more than two seasons in Tennessee history, and the worst overall since 1906. He also has the worst record of all Tennessee coaches in SEC play. On November 18, 2012, Dooley was fired from his head coaching position effective immediately, being replaced by Butch Jones, the former head coach of the University of Cincinnati.|$|E
