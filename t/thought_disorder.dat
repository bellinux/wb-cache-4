Poverty of thought {{is one of the}} negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and might also be a feature of severe depression or dementia.

5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorder,</b> and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

The cerebral correlates of selective attention are structured differently in patients with mildly expressed positive formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> and patients with severely expressed positive formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders.</b> We compared 20 female schizophrenic patients, 10 with slight and 10 with obvious formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders,</b> and 10 control subjects regarding the test results of selective attention and the corresponding cerebral correlates. We used a neuropsychological battery to survey psychological parameters. Tests measuring alertness and selective attention (Go/NoGo) served as stimulation paradigm and reference paradigm {{for the assessment of}} the rCBF, using H 215 O-PET. While the first hypothesis has not been confirmed, we found that the cerebral regions activated by selective attention in both clinical subgroups showed completely different organisations. Low degrees of formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> were accompanied with significant activations in frontal superior gyrus and ventral anterior thalamic nucleus whereas high degrees of formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> were associated by significant activations in fusiform gyrus and precuneus.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Disorders</b> of <b>thought</b> are psychopathological {{phenomena}} commonly {{present in}} schizophrenia {{and seem to}} result from deficits of semantic processing. Schizotypal personality traits consist of tendencies to think and behave that are qualitatively similar to schizophrenia, with greater vulnerability to such disorder. This study reviewed the literature about semantic processing deficits in samples of individuals with schizotypal traits and discussed the impact of current knowledge upon the comprehension of schizophrenic <b>thought</b> <b>disorders.</b> Studies about the cognitive performance of healthy individuals with schizotypal traits help understand the semantic deficits underlying psychotic <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> with the advantage of avoiding confounding factors usually found in samples of individuals with schizophrenia, {{such as the use}} of antipsychotics and hospitalizations. Methods: A search for articles published in Portuguese or English within the last 10 years on the databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, LILACS and Biological Abstracts was conducted, using the keywords semantic processing, schizotypy and schizotypal personality disorder. Results: The search retrieved 44 manuscripts, out of which 11 were firstly chosen. Seven manuscripts were additionally included after reading these papers. Conclusion: The great majority of the included studies showed that schizotypal subjects might exhibit semantic processing deficits. They help clarify about the interfaces between cognitive, neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms underlying not only <b>thought</b> <b>disorders,</b> but also healthy human mind's creativity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Thought</b> and {{language}} <b>disorders</b> are main features of adults with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders however studies on such abnormalities are scant in young patients with very early onset psychosis (VEOS). The {{aim of the}} present study is to assess the relationship between language and <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> in patients with very early onset schizophrenia (SCZ), schizoaffective disorders (SCA) and bipolar disorders (BD). Method Forty-one patients (18 SCZ, 16 BD, and 7 SCA) with mean age less than 15 years old were assessed through a series of neurocognitive and psycholinguistic tests, including the Thought, Language and Communication Scale (TLC). Results SCZ group performed worse in all tests as well as the TLC, followed by SCA and BD groups respectively. <b>Thought</b> <b>disorders</b> were related to deficits in executive functioning and semantic processing, and the metaphors&# 8217; test was the best predictor of TLC functioning.

However, for behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), studies on the broad spectrum of psychotic symptoms are still lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to systematically and prospectively subtype the wide spectrum of psychotic symptoms in probable and definite bvFTD. Methods: In this study, a commonly used and validated clinical scale that quantifies the broad spectrum of psychotic symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale) was used in patients with probable and definite bvFTD (n= 22) and with a primary psychiatric disorder (n= 35) in a late-onset frontal lobe cohort. Median symptom duration was 2. 8 years, and the patients were prospectively followed for 2 years. Results: In total, 22. 7 % of bvFTD patients suffered from delusions, hallucinatory behavior, and suspiciousness, although the majority of the patients exhibited negative psychotic symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and blunted affect (95. 5 %) and formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> (81. 8 %). “Difficulty in abstract thinking” and “stereotypical thinking” (formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders)</b> differentiated bvFTD from psychiatric disorders. The combined predictors difficulty in abstract thinking, stereotypical thinking, “anxiety”, “guilt feelings,” and “tension” explained 75. 4 % of variance in the diagnosis of bvFTD versus psychiatric diagnoses (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Delusions, hallucinatory behavior, and suspiciousness were present in one-fifth of bvFTD patients, whereas negative psychotic symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, and formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> were more frequently present. This suggests that negative psychotic symptoms and formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorders</b> have an important role in the psychiatric misdiagnosis in bvFTD; misdiagnosis in bvFTD might be reduced by systematically exploring the broad spectrum of psychiatric symptoms.

2500|$|The Rorschach test is a {{psychological}} test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both.

2500|$|Individuals {{affected}} by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that {{are independent of}} affective state. In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted.

Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the formal <b>thought</b> <b>disorder</b> that is a feature of mania. It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis demonstrated greater impairment on measures of executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.|$|E

[...] They characterized patients as having [...] "paraphrenic delusions which… occurred in each case in the setting of a well-preserved intellect and personality, were often ‘primary’ in character, and were usually associated with the passivity failings or other volitional disturbances and hallucinations in clear consciousness pathognomonic of schizophrenia".|$|E
