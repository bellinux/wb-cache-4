5|$|Brodie's theories—laid {{out in the}} book—of Smith fathering {{children}} through polygamist relationships {{have been among the}} catalysts for professional genetic genealogy studies. During the 2000s, researchers at the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation used Y-DNA testing to trace the ancestry of descendants of three of the five children whom Brodie suggested, and found <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three were fathered by Smith.|$|E

5|$|SAS Flight 347 was a scheduled, {{domestic}} flight from Bardufoss Airport via Bodø Airport to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Check-in and boarding ran as normal, without any security check. At Bardufoss, 122 people boarded the aircraft, including {{a large group}} of soldiers who were on leave of absence and on their way home to Southern Norway. Representatives from the ground handlers stated <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passengers acted suspiciously.|$|E

The episode resulted in work that was so successful <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contestants were eliminated.|$|E

5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened {{to at the}} highest possible volume, and the trumpeter was credited for the arrangements. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about Davis being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music sounded {{as if it had}} been arranged.|$|E

5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designs were suitable.|$|E

5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ivory could be used.|$|E

5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 Keynes had {{the option}} to enter Parliament as an {{independent}} MP with the University of Cambridge seat.

Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1908, {{less than}} six weeks after the inquiry closed, the Local Government Board issued a draft {{provisional}} bill for the federation of the six towns. This was not unexpected but the rating scheme proposed differed from the schemes discussed during the inquiry and included a complicated valuation of the properties belonging to each municipality, something <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towns wished to carry out. Nevertheless, Hanley, Longton and Tunstall all supported the draft order while Stoke, Fenton and Burslem opposed it.|$|E

On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E
