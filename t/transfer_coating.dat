40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the first}} two {{articles}} in this series, the influence of fabric construction and of coating characteristics on the mechanical properties of coated cotton fabrics were discussed. All of the coating described in these articles was applied by a knife over blanket technique. In the work described herein, other application techniques were used, including floating knife, re-verse roll, and <b>transfer</b> <b>coating.</b> Tearing strengths were measured, and pene-tration studied by the stereo technique described previously. High tearing strengths could be obtained {{by all of the}} coating techniques, but no simple relationship existed between tearing strength and degree of penetration. Certain of the techniques created a porosity in the penetrated coating which is believed to be responsible for the high tearing strengths obtained...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that fabrics having a wettability gradient from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic through the thickness direction show a novel directional water transfer effect: water can transfer from the superhydrophobic to the hydrophilic side, {{but not in}} the opposite direction unless an external force is applied. A sol–gel technology was used to prepare a nano-structured superhydrophobic coating on fabrics, and the coated fabrics showed water contact-angle as high as 165 degrees. When the coated fabric was subjected to a photochemistry treatment from one fabric side, the irradiated surface turned hydrophilic permanently, while the back side still maintained the superhydrophobicity. The treated fabric can transfer water droplet rapidly from hydrophobic to hydrophilic side, and the pressure allowing water breakthrough the fabric are different considerably between the two fabric sides. The directional water transfer effect is affected by the wettability gradient. Such a directional water <b>transfer</b> <b>coating</b> may be useful to develop new functional fabrics for defence applications...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nature of Supercell coating, an on-line tablet coater that employed a unique pattern of airflow. Tablets coated at different spray rates (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mL/min) were analyzed to investigate the influence of different wetting conditions on the quality of coats formed. Scanning electron micrographs showed that tablet coats formed at a spray rate of 4 mL/min consisted of spray-dried droplets that did not coalesce. At a spray rate of 6 mL/min, surface roughness was found to be lower than at the other spray rates, and the coat appeared smoothest, whereby droplets seemed fused together. At higher spray rates, the droplets appeared as branching arms and scale-like structures. This was attributed to the spread of spray droplets by the processing air and mass <b>transfer</b> of wet <b>coating</b> materials between tablets. Further tests showed that coats formed at higher spray rates had higher drug yield, drug uniformity, color uniformity, and density. However, the variability in coat thickness was increased due to the mass <b>transfer</b> of <b>coats</b> and dissolution of tablet core surfaces by the coating material. Since coats of different characteristics can be formed in Supercell coating, the choice of wetting conditions would depend on the type of coat required and the coating materials used...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{has been}} appcved i Abstract Ifox public release and sale; its distribution is uniimited. Read-write sliders made of silicon using integrated-circuit technology offer advantages of low-cost and high volume production. In {{the present study}} our objective is to investigate whether the friction and wear performance of bare silicon is adequate for disk drive application or whether certain coatings/treatments are necessary for low friction and wear. Macrotribological experiments have been performed with various pin/slider materials and magnetic disks in a modified disk drive. Microtribological studies have also been conducted on silicon using a friction force microscope. Based on macrotests, {{we found that the}} friction and wear performance of bare silicon is not adequate. With single and polycrystalline silicon, transfer of amorphous carbon from the disk to the pin/slider and oxidation-enhanced fracture of pin/slider material followed by oxidation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>coating</b> is responsible for degradation of the sliding interface and consequent friction increase in ambient air. With dry-oxidized or PECVD-SiO 2 -coated silicon, no significant friction increase or interfacial degradation was observed in ambient air. In the absence of an oxidizing environment (in dry nitrogen), the coefficient of friction decreased from 0. 2 to 0. 05 following amorphous carbon transfer for the materials tested. Nanoscratching/nanowear and nanoindentation studies also indicate that coated silicon is superior to bare silicon. Macro-and micro-coefficient of friction values of all samples are found to be about the same with the microvalues. ower than the macrovalues. Based on this study, we conclude that coated silicon is an excellent candidate for the construction of magnetic head sliders...|$|E

40|$|Splat {{studies are}} a central area of {{research}} because they can provide fundamental knowledge on the phenomena controlling the final coating properties such as coating microstructure and adhesion. Wetting and heat transfer are expected to influence the final splat shape while they are in turn controlled {{by the presence of}} oxides and adsorbed species on the substrate surface. It is however difficult to follow the flattening of a sprayed droplet at the micrometer scale. Since the mid nineties, so-called free falling experiments have been developed with which it is possible to simulate the thermal spray process. The millimetre sized drops allow investigating the flattening and solidification occurring in milliseconds instead of in microseconds. In this study, the microstructure of plasma sprayed Ni-Al splats and millimetre sized droplets produced on TiAlV and pure Ti substrates, respectively, are compared. By use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), especially the cross-section of splats and droplets has been investigated. In the splats, diffusion across the splat-substrate interface and the formation of an interface layer is detected. In the droplets, up to 3 different layers are formed at the interface to the substrate.
