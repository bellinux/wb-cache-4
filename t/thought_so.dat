The position would have made Williams the second {{in command of the}} American Army, but citing poor health and no ambition for the position, Williams declined the appointment. However, on December 21, 1792, Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the archaeologists}} {{returned}} {{to search for}} the settlement that they believed was associated with the graves. There are examples elsewhere, such as at Garton Green Lane Crossing in the Yorkshire Wolds, of 7th-century graves associated with prehistoric monuments, and it was initially thought that the Street House graves were a similar example. However, the excavation uncovered another twelve graves. It was realised that the cemetery was far larger than first <b>thought,</b> <b>so</b> the following year an archaeological survey of the entire site was attempted. A total of 109 graves was found {{by the end of the}} 2007 dig, forming a complex monument laid out in a unique square fashion around a central mound, a bed burial and a building that had possibly served as a mortuary.|$|E

This caused it to be delayed, and the only part that was open for the fall 2009 school term was the busway within York University, which started operation on September 6, 2009. Consequently, route 196 buses continued to use Keele and Sheppard avenues. The busway was officially opened on November 20, 2009 and route 196 was rerouted immediately. Other TTC routes using the busway were rerouted a week later.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Woodward, {{along with the}} British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, {{postulated}} a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting {{of a combination of}} an organic molecule with iron. This {{marked the beginning of the}} field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field. Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer. Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.|$|E
25|$|Easton {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the “first generation of behavioral revolutionaries” in the discipline of political science. Like other early behavioralists, Easton initially sought to gain control over the masses of data being generated by social science research in the early 1950s, which they thought was overwhelming social scientists with quantitative and qualitative data {{in the absence of an}} organizing theoretical framework. Easton argued for development of a proper science of political studies that would produce reliable, universal knowledge about social phenomena, and that the purpose of scientific rules of procedure was to make possible the discovery of a highly generalized theory of politics. Easton’s vision was one of a “general theory” of political science that would consist of a deductive system of <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> that a limited number of postulates, as assumptions and axioms, a whole body of empirically valid generalizations might be deduced in descending order of specificity and provide predictive causal explanations of political behavior.|$|E

25|$|A {{deadly force}} for Transvaal against lesser batsmen on matting {{during the late}} 1920s – by which time his bowling on these wickets had been {{developed}} into a fine art – in 1930–31 Nupen was, owing {{to the absence of}} South Africa's former captain Nummy Deane due to poor form, chosen to captain the Test team against England. He did so with considerable skill and accomplished the best bowling of his Test career. He took 5 for 63 and 6 for 87 in the First Test to give South Africa victory by 28 runs, and 3 for 148 and 6 for 46 in the drawn Fourth Test. However, Nupen was <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> badly of on turf pitches that he was left out of the Third and Fifth Tests, the first two ever played on turf in South Africa. He achieved his best-ever domestic figures the following year with 43 wickets for 434 runs (including 9 for 48 and 7 for 88 in the match against Griqualand West). In 28 Currie Cup matches for Transvaal he took 190 wickets at an average of 12.92, nine times taking 10 or more wickets in a match.|$|E
25|$|With three {{separate}} {{organizations in the}} confined waters of the lower Mississippi, the fleet command situation was already bad enough, but it began to deteriorate further when the buildup of Farragut's fleet in the lower river became apparent. Flag Officer Hollins was at this time near Memphis, which represented the then-northernmost holdings of the Confederacy on the river, and the Confederate War Department insisted that no effort should be spared to maintain possession. Hollins was sure that the threat from the Gulf was much more severe than Richmond <b>thought,</b> <b>so</b> {{he was prepared to}} listen when General Lovell pleaded for him to come down to New Orleans to help in its defense. When there, he sent a telegram to Richmond seeking permission to attack Farragut's ships while they were still lightened to be brought in across the bar. His pleas were so insistent that they virtually amounted to insubordination. Hollins was called to Richmond, ostensibly to serve on an examination board, but in effect to be removed from active service. By default, command of the Confederate Navy vessels in the vicinity of New Orleans fell on the shoulders of Commander William C. Whittle, up to that time commandant of the navy yard there. Whittle did not consider himself able to handle all of his new duties, so on April 18 he passed command of CSS McRae, Jackson, and Manassas, together with their support vessels, to his executive officer, Commander John K. Mitchell. These were all the Confederate Naval vessels afloat at the time; Louisiana and Mississippi had not yet been launched, and were explicitly not controlled by Whittle or Mitchell. Later, when Louisiana was launched but before she was completed, she joined the others in Mitchell's domain.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress {{convened in}} Philadelphia. When war seemed inevitable, Wythe was elected as Virginia's {{delegate}} to replace George Washington, who took {{command of the}} continental forces. George and Elizabeth Wythe moved to Philadelphia by September, and were inoculated against smallpox, as were fellow delegate Francis Lightfoot Lee and his lady and others. By October, Thomas Jefferson had rejoined the Congress to work with his former teacher and the other delegates, although personal tragedy forced him to leave for five months {{in the winter and}} spring. Wythe accepted many assignments relating to military, currency and other matters. He, John Dickinson and John Jay also went to New Jersey that winter and convinced that colony's assembly to maintain a united front. When petitions and other attempts failed to resolve the crisis by the following summer, all while Dunmore's raiders harassed Virginia settlements from its waterways, Wythe moved and then voted in favor of the resolution for independence that Jefferson had drafted upon his return. His fellow Virginia delegates in Philadelphia held Wythe in such esteem, that they left the first space open for Wythe when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, John Adams, who did not like many Virginians, <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> highly of Wythe that he wrote 'Thoughts on Government' concerning establishing constitutions for state governments after the war. Earlier in the session, Wythe also exchanged humorous verses with his friend delegate William Ellery of Rhode Island despite their political differences. Wythe thus signed the Declaration of Independence upon his (and his wife's) return to Philadelphia in September. The signers' names were not made public until the following January, for all knew the declaration was an act of treason, punishable by death should their rebellion fail.|$|E

It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is {{the very thought of}} this film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought.

500|$|Akhtar {{revealed}} that the reason behind the remake was a desire to give a new treatment to [...] "a fantastic film which he enjoyed watching as a child", and create an adaptation that he thought would suit modern times. He found the film little ahead of its time. And, he <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> because of the narration, dialogue and the writing style, which he thought was very modern even for its time. Akhtar said [...] "Don is the one film from that time that in my mind lends itself to being remade today. So today, when you adapt it, it fits very easily into a contemporary space. I think it fits into the modern sensibility of movie viewing." [...] Additionally, he wanted {{to pay tribute to}} the stars and makers of the original film, the 1970s era in general, and the films made by Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan.|$|E
500|$|The series concludes {{the revelation}} that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a {{simulation}} by the Shadowy Figure.

They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz.

Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges."

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee.

I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|Although, after Keats's death, {{recognition}} of the merits of his poetry came slowly, by mid century, despite widespread Victorian disapproval of the alleged [...] "weakness" [...] of his character and the view often advanced [...] "that Keats's work represented mere sensuality without substance", some of his poems began to find an appreciative audience, including [...] "To Autumn". In an 1844 essay on Keats's poetry in the Dumfries Herald, George Gilfillian placed [...] "To Autumn" [...] among [...] "the finest of Keats' smaller pieces". In an 1851 lecture, David Macbeth Moir acclaimed [...] "four exquisite odes,—'To a Nightingale,' 'To a Grecian Urn,' 'To Melancholy,' and 'To Autumn,'—all so pregnant with deep <b>thought,</b> <b>so</b> picturesque in their limning, and so suggestive." [...] In 1865, Matthew Arnold singled out the [...] "indefinable delicacy, charm, and perfection of [...] Keats's [...] in his Autumn". John Dennis, in an 1883 work about great poets, wrote that [...] "the 'Ode to Autumn', ripe with {{the glory of the}} season it describes—must ever have a place among the most precious gems of lyrical poetry." [...] The 1888 Britannica declared, [...] "Of these [...] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn".|$|E

500|$|The U.S. population's {{perception}} of Black Lives Matter varies considerably by race. According to a September 2015 poll on race relations, {{nearly two-thirds of}} African Americans mostly agree with Black Lives Matter, while 42% of white Americans are unsure or {{do not have an}} opinion about Black Lives Matter. Of white people surveyed, 41% thought that Black Lives Matter advocated violence, and 59% of whites thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the real issues of racial discrimination. By comparison, 82% of black people polled thought that Black Lives Matter was a nonviolent movement, and 26% of blacks thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the real issues of racial discrimination. On the question of whether [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] was mostly a movement or mostly a slogan, 46% of whites and 67% of blacks thought that it is mostly a movement. A similar poll in June 2016 found that 65% of black American adults supported Black Lives Matter and 40% of white American adults support it.

500|$|Frederik Pohl {{took over}} the editorship of both If and Galaxy in 1961. Gold had had a car {{accident}} with sufficiently severe health consequences {{to prevent him from}} being able to continue as editor. Pohl, who had been intermittently helping Gold with editorial duties for some time prior to the car accident, is first listed as editor of If on the masthead of the November 1961 issue, and as editor of Galaxy for the December 1961 issue, but he had been acting as editor of both magazines since at least midyear. Pohl paid one cent per word for the stories he bought for If, whereas Galaxy paid three cents per word, and like Gold, he regarded Galaxy as the leading magazine of the two, whereas If was somewhere he could work with new writers, and try experiments and whims. This developed into a selling point when a letter from a reader, Clayton Hamlin, prompted Pohl to declare that he would publish a new writer in every single issue of the magazine, though he was also able to attract well-known writers. When Pohl began his stint as editor, both magazines were operating at a loss; despite Ifs lower budget, Pohl found it more fun to edit, and commented that apparently the readers <b>thought</b> <b>so,</b> too; he was able to make If show a profit before Galaxy, adding, [...] "What was fun for me seemed to be fun for them." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kinetoscope {{was also}} gaining notice {{on the other}} side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was {{demonstrated}} at 20, boulevard Poissonnière in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the Lumière brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system. On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, claims that Edison [...] "apparently <b>thought</b> <b>so</b> little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright [...]" [...] As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison [...] "balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents" [...] and [...] "saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope." [...] Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.|$|E
