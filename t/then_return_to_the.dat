5|$|The Invasion of Guadeloupe was a British amphibious {{operation}} fought between 28 January and 6 February 1810 {{over control of}} the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars. The island was the final remaining French colony in the Americas, following the systematic invasion and capture of the others during 1809 by British forces. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French colonies had provided protected harbours for French privateers and warships, which could prey on the numerous British trade routes in the Caribbean and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colonies before British warships could react. In response, the British instituted a blockade of the islands, stationing ships off every port and seizing any vessel that tried to enter or leave. With trade and communication made dangerous by the British blockade squadrons, the economies and morale of the French colonies began to collapse, and in the summer of 1808 desperate messages were sent to France requesting helping.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{water spider}} {{is unusual in}} that males are almost always larger than females. This is called sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD). When water spiders mate the male begins by approaching the female’s diving bell. He then chases {{her out of the}} diving bell and they begin “courtship swimming.” They <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female’s diving bell to mate.|$|E
25|$|The {{piston stroke}} is an {{essential}} component of Stevens technique. With this stroke, the mallets start in the up position, strike the bars, <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> up position. The mallets are propelled completely by the wrist, and there is no prep stroke. When changing notes, the piston stroke is modified so that it starts above the first note and ends above the second note, ready to strike.|$|E

25|$|The {{underground}} station at Waterloo was {{located within the}} existing transverse arches of the main line station, with the arrival and departure platforms in separate arches, and a staircase access. Siding accommodation and a reversing siding were provided beyond the platforms: after disembarkation of passengers, an arriving train would continue forward to the reversing sidings, and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> departure platform. An additional lay-by siding was provided later.|$|E
25|$|Some foreign {{visitors}} sometimes engage {{in what is}} known as a visa run: leaving a country—usually to a neighboring country—for a short period just before the permitted length of stay expires, <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first country to get a new entry stamp in order to extend their stay ("reset the clock"). Despite the name, a visa run is usually done with a passport {{that can be used for}} an entry without a visa.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be {{designated}} as on-ice captains, because of the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease. (The Vancouver Canucks named goaltender Roberto Luongo as their captain during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, but due to NHL rules, he did not serve as the official on-ice captain.) In the NCAA, there is no position-based restriction on the team captain.|$|E

25|$|In all of this, the {{flagship}} of Don Fadrique had entirely managed {{to pass through}} the enemy formation, and turning back toward the convoy, he decided to launch his ship against two other Dutch naos, and soon sent down and pay one of them, while the second could ignite. But the fire soon spread to his own ship and he ordered to turn it off and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battle approaching his ships by the weather side, again not to fear the spread.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Vincent {{purchases}} heroin {{from his}} drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom Marsellus has asked Vincent to escort {{while he is}} out of town. They head to a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wallace house with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenaline shot to her heart.|$|E
25|$|Batsmen are {{required}} to retire upon reaching a pre-agreed personal score, usually 25 or 30. Should the side be dismissed {{with a number of}} batsmen retired, they may <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease in the order they retired. It is not unprecedented for a batsman to retire for a second or even third time in one innings. This rule ensures that the majority of a team will get a bat, and hence ensures the emphasis on the entire team both getting involved and being able to contribute to the final score.|$|E

25|$|Barrel {{racing and}} pole bending – the timed speed and agility events seen in rodeo {{as well as}} gymkhana or O-Mok-See competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an {{exclusively}} women's sport. In a barrel race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run {{the length of a}} line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> start.|$|E
25|$|The Fallen teleports {{to their}} {{location}} and steals the Matrix from Optimus, then {{returns to the}} pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. Jetfire, who was wounded by Scroponok but did manage to kill him, sacrifices himself in order for Optimus to gain his parts, which give him immense strength {{and the ability to}} fly. Optimus knocks the Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid, destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. In the battle, Optimus disables Megatron and kills the Fallen; vowing vengeance, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The victorious Autobots and their allies <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, having saved the world.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} {{only one}} {{program would be}} running at a time, the engineers were able to ignore the concept of reentrancy; the ability for a program (or library) to be stopped at any point, asked to do something else, and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original task. In the case of QuickDraw for example, this means the system can store state information internally, like the current location of the window or the line style, knowing it would only change under control of the running program. Taking this one step further, the engineers left most of this state inside the application rather than in QuickDraw, thus eliminating the need to copy this data between the application and library.|$|E

25|$|From Overbeck Bridge on the Wastwater road a way can {{be found}} up to Low Tarn, gaining the summit via the long western slopes. Alternatively Over Beck can be {{followed}} to its source at Dore Head, before making up the south ridge. Dore Head can also be reached from Mosedale if starting from Wasdale Head, although a long climb up scree is involved. It is possible instead to ascend Black Comb on easier slopes and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit. Red Pike is often {{the start of the}} Mosedale Horseshoe, a ridgewalk also visiting Scoat Fell and Pillar. Depending upon the strength of the walker Yewbarrow and Kirk Fell may also be added.|$|E
25|$|When the cricket ball {{is inside}} the boundary, it is live. When the ball is {{touching}} the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving, often flick the ball back in {{to the field of}} play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler.|$|E
25|$|Oxford: Prior to {{admission}} to the degree, the graduand will normally wear either the undergraduate commoner's or scholar's gown (if being admitted to the BA), or the graduate student's gown or the gown and hood of their previous Oxford/external university degree (if being admitted to a higher degree). After being formally admitted during the ceremony, they exit the Theatre and assume the gowns and hoods of their new degrees and <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Theatre in their new gowns and hoods. For certain degrees such as the higher doctorates and MAs, if they profess the Christian faith, the graduand may (if they wish) kneel {{in front of the}} (Vice-)Chancellor and be admitted in 'the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit' whilst being tapped on the head with the Bible.|$|E
