In April 2012, in a similar attempt, the Bertelsmann Stiftung presented a blueprint for establishing an international non-profit credit rating agency (INCRA) for sovereign debt, structured in way <b>that</b> <b>management</b> and rating decisions are independent from its financiers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them <b>that</b> <b>management</b> refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E

5|$|One {{month before}} the Senators were to open the new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor {{attendance}} at the Civic Centre, the Senators organization was in turmoil. Star player Alexei Yashin, angered <b>that</b> <b>management</b> favoured Daigle over him despite posting higher numbers, was a contract hold-out. First-round draft choice Bryan Berard, who had left the Senators training camp unsigned to a contract, had publicly stated {{that he would never}} report to the Senators. After Head Coach Rick Bowness demoted Daigle had been demoted to the fourth line, General Manager Randy Sexton fired Bowness and Assistant Coach Alain Vigneault on November 20, 1995. He replaced the coaches with Prince Edward Island Senators coach Dave Allison and gave the assistant coaching job to former Hartford Whalers Head Coach Pierre McGuire, who was working at the time as a scout for the Senators. Daigle was returned to full-time duty, but Sexton's changes did not improve the team's play.|$|E
5|$|Square trademarked Seiken Densetsu in , {{intending}} {{to use it}} for a game project subtitled The Emergence of Excalibur, and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks, {{making it one of the}} largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms <b>that</b> <b>management</b> canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson <b>that</b> <b>Management</b> had planned for Ben to kill him so all of his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the Usher, Ben's ultimate nemesis.|$|E

40|$|Diversity {{management}} has been implemented vigorously in organizations with workforce diversity practices. One {{of the possible}} outcomes of diversity management is increased fairness in the organization. However, women perceive organizations as still being unfair, even though diverse managerial practices have been adopted to address equity related problems. In this article, we examine how female employees in federal agencies view diversity management and whether they believe <b>that</b> diversity <b>management</b> can lead to organizational justice. By using the 2013 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) data, we found <b>that</b> diversity <b>management</b> leads {{to a higher level}} of organizational justice for female employees. However, white female employees have a higher agreement on the effi cacy of diversity management in producing procedural and interactional justice than do non-white female employees. Also, female employees in the regulatory or redistributive agency category perceive less <b>that</b> diversity <b>management</b> leads to organizational justice than those in other agencies. We therefore conclude <b>that</b> diversity <b>management</b> is an effective tool to achieve organizational justice for particular groups. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we argue <b>that</b> risk <b>management</b> {{can be an}} {{important}} source of competitive advantage for firms. For this to happen, managers must overcome four deep-seated notions about the management of risk: the myopic conception that risk is a collection of unconnected threats to the survival of a firm, the belief <b>that</b> risk <b>management</b> is largely a financial activity, the idea <b>that</b> risk <b>management</b> is solely a top management team task, and a blind faith that CEOs can continuously anticipate the risks that firms must address on an ongoing basis. Challenging these four misconceptions reveals <b>that</b> risk <b>management</b> can be an activity that is value creating, not just value preserving. Indeed, rather than indiscriminately shedding all types of risks, companies can develop new sources of competitive advantage by embracing those risks that they are relatively better at managing than their rivals. We illustrate our arguments by analyzing the risk management practices at CEMEX, the Mexican cement manufacturer. ...|$|R
