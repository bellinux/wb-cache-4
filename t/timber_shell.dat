5000|$|Hawley puts {{forth the}} {{hypothesis}} that the idea of ironclad turtle ships has its origins in the writings of late 19th-century Westerners returning from Korea. The progression from casual comparison to a statement of fact that the turtle ships anticipated the modern ironclad by centuries can be roughly charted in retrospect, starting no earlier than ca. 1880. Coming in touch with local tales of ancient armoured ships in a period which saw the rise of Western-type ironclad warship to global prominence, these authors may have naturally conjured up the image of metal armour, instead of a more traditional heavy <b>timber</b> <b>shell.</b> For instance, when Korea was threatened by the French Navy, the government ordered an ironclad ship be built [...] "like the turtle ship". However, despite all efforts the design failed to float. Turnbull believes that the 19th century experience should not rule out a [...] "limited amount of armor plating in 1592".|$|E
40|$|A <b>timber</b> <b>shell</b> {{structure}} {{is designed to}} provide covering for an outdoor auditorium in Madrid (Spain). The covering comprises five independent overlapped marquees with similar shape but diverse dimensions. The surface geometry of each marquee is defined by a hyperbolic paraboloid, with its boundaries delimited by elliptical curves in horizontal projection. Structural section for the <b>timber</b> <b>shell</b> is a composite section with several staggered layers of straight sawn timber planks, arranged in two orthogonal directions following the straight skew lines of the hyperbolic paraboloid. Over them two continuous top layers are arranged which provides bracing for the structure and support for the waterproofing material. Each layer is laid over the previous one, bolted and glued with polyurethane adhesive. Special characteristics of the design analysis and detailed erection process are described. The designed solution provides lightweight roofing with a powerful and original image, short construction time and reasonable budget...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{four types of}} {{fastening}} and of scaling on the properties of a <b>timber</b> <b>shell</b> membrane were studied. The membrane was a three layer type made of ex 4 x 1 in. T & G radiata pine boards, the centre layer running {{at right angles to}} the outer layers. The fastenings were three densities of nailing and one of nail-gluing. Timber properties were characterised by grading modulus (g. m.) which was the stiffness of prototype boards on the flat under centre point loading over a 3 ft span while the fastenings were characterised by the load-slip behaviour of representative joints. The joint behaviour showed little correlation with g. m. Prototype and 1 / 5 scale model elements were tested in compression shear, bending and torsion and elastic constants were computed. The various constants were affected to different degrees by the four types of fastening according to the level of stress carried by the fastening under the various element loadings. The model similitude obtained in the elements was good when this was based on g. m., the load-slip behaviour of representative joints and the weight of glue spread per unit area of glueline. Two 1 / 5 scale model cylindrical timber shells were built and tested, one nailed and the other nail-glued. Their deflections were about twice those calculated by a simplified analysis for orthotropic shells. Their relative behaviour was similar to the relative behaviour of the model elements in shear which suggests that the discrepancy between calculated and observed deflections arose from shear deformation which the analysis ignored...|$|E

The design process combined a zero-length spring funicular form-finding approach with a planar polygon discretisation method, thus enabling the final structurally efficient but complex geometric form to be realised with low-cost materials. The <b>timber</b> plate <b>shell</b> is fully demountable and has been assembled at several separate locations since being completed in September 2012. To the authors’ knowledge, the structure {{is one of the}} largest free-form facetted thin shell structures ever to be constructed.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to resolve the}} contradictory relationship between the ecological merits of wood construction and the significant material intensity of recent free form timber surface structures. The building industry is now adept {{in the design and}} construction of freeform surface architecture, however new challenges have been introduced with the environmentally conscious desire to build these structures in wood. Lacking the formal versatility of steel and concrete, wood introduces a great deal of difficulty in the realization of complex form at an architectural scale. Powerful digital design and fabrication tools have recently made it possible to model, analyze and construct these buildings, but at the cost of heavy structural solutions that involve energy intensive fabrication processes and significant material waste. This approach contradicts the ecological benefits of wood, and {{raises the question of whether}} it is possible to achieve free and expressive form in timber surface architecture while maintaining an economy of means and material. This question is addressed through the development of a generative design tool for the creation of material conscious free form timber surface architecture. The formation of the tool is informed by the field of computational morphogenesis, which draws from the natural growth processes of biological structures in the virtual synthesis of form. The tool is conceived as a morphogenetic material system, which consists of a generative algorithm that integrates material, structure and form in a single computational process. Specific material saving techniques deployed in the algorithm draw from existing research in <b>timber</b> <b>shell</b> design and material optimization. Established methods in the use of geodesic lines for the structural patterning of wood shells and stress driven material distribution make up the core concepts deployed in the algorithm. The material system is developed, refined and tested through the design and construction of an experimental free form timber lattice...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{original}} organic shape and the column free space that they provide, the design of grid shell structures challenges architects and structural engineers {{in more than one}} way. Very few grid shell building exist around the world. This scarcity may be explained by the level of innovation required in such fields as design technique; construction scheme, use of material [...] . The goal {{of this paper is to}} unify the design work done on grid shells, to understand the evolution of the designs and to provide the reader with a sense of what awaits grid shell structures in the future. The construction of a <b>timber</b> grid <b>shell</b> starts from a flat, two dimensional wooden net, the three dimensional shell type structure is then achieved by pushing on the edges of this mat and gradually releasing the internal stresses at the joints to enable the shape to live and the structure to take its most adequate form. Only three wooden grid-shell structures exist world wide, by studying the way they work and behave, as well as the process that lead to the choice of such a structure, we'll understand how grid shell were born in the mind of architects and structural engineers. (cont.) Even if the mechanism of grid shells is a very clever and well thought system, as wood remains a lively material, it can be subjected to degradation and deformation which as a result will damage the structure and attend to its integrity. Timber construction is also limited in terms of load carrying capacity. As grid shells have become more popular new solutions have been developed in terms of choice of material. Steel has already replaced timber in large span glass grid shell and the use of composite materials to benefit of the original construction scheme of <b>timber</b> grid <b>shell</b> is currently being investigated. by Céline Paoli.

40|$|Automatic joinery {{has become}} a common {{technique}} for the jointing of beams in timber framing and roofing. It has revived traditional, inte-grated joints such as mortise and tenon connections. Similarly, but only recently, the automatic fabrication of traditional cabinetmaking joints has been introduced for the assembly of <b>timber</b> panel <b>shell</b> structures. First prototypes have used such integrated joints for the alignment and assem-bly of components, while additional adhesive bonding {{was used for the}} load-bearing connection. However, glued joints cannot be assembled on site, which results in several design constraints. In this paper, we propose the use of dovetail joints without adhesive bonding, on the case study of a timber folded plate structure. Through their single-degree-of-freedom (1 DOF) geometry, these joints block the relative movement of two parts in all but one direction. This presents the opportunity for an interlocking connection of plates, as well as a challenge for the assembly of folded plate shells, where multiple non-parallel edges per plate must be jointed simultaneously. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{necessity}} of using renewable resources and sustainable solutions in the building sector has become obvious, and interest in timber as a building material has revived. Novel timber-derived products, such as massif block panels, have emerged {{and the use of}} such products is spreading. The IBOIS research concerns {{the development of a new}} generation of timber constructions, made out of innovative timber-derived products, derived by applying textile principles on a building scale. It aims at the unprecedented exploration and study of timber related structures and their structural analyses within a framework integrating the mechanical and structural principles of textiles. The validity of this approach is based on the fact that both, wood and fabrics, are fibre-based tissues. Since timber can be viewed as a fibre-derived product it follows that the analogy between micro scale fibre structures and timber-derived wooden structures can be explored at micro-and macro-scale.

50|$|Augie Dux later took {{up several}} oyster bank {{licenses}} in southern Moreton Bay, including Oyster Bank 122 in Tippler's Passage (1928). His sons {{helped him to}} develop the oyster banks, obtaining <b>timber</b> and <b>shell</b> bedding from Crusoe and Rat islands nearby. On Oyster Camp Reserve R.638, directly opposite Oyster Bank 122, Augie Dux and his son Stanley erected a one-roomed hut, for use when working their oyster lease in Tippler's Passage. It is understood they re-used timbers initially cut by Augie in 1918, when {{the family moved to}} Broad Street, Labrador, where they erected a house of saplings and bark, with a hardwood floor. About 1929 this house was demolished and replaced with a new house of milled-timber, the timbers of the 1918 building being re-cycled in the hut on South Stradbroke Island. The stumps of this hut are understood to be of Bloodwood, the framing of Ti-tree saplings, and the floor and some of the wall linings of hardwood, all of which was cut by Augie Dux and his sons in the Labrador area. Oyster farming at this period was still highly labour-intensive, and poaching was a continual problem. Stanley Dux recalls spending from Monday to Saturday each week at the hut, working and guarding the oyster bank.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical model for twist in timber. The model {{is based on}} calculating the twist in cylindrical shells and combining these <b>shells</b> to create <b>timber</b> studs. The <b>shells</b> will deform when the moisture content changes, owing to tangential shrinkage perpendicular to the fibre direction and longitudinal shrinkage parallel to the fibre direction. If the fibre direction is not parallel to the shell direction, this will cause twist in the shell. The twist in each shell contributes to the twist in the stud. The model {{has been used for}} a parametric study to determine theoretically the influence of parameters such as sawing pattern, stud size, spiral grain angle variation and tangential and longitudinal shrinkage. The model has also been used to predict the twist in 196 studs of Norway spruce timber. The model was able to predict 67 % of the variation in twist among these studs...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} <b>timber</b> rip <b>shells</b> confronts the {{engineer}} with major uncertainties during the planning process. The {{consideration of the}} elastic compound cross section during structural analysis of curved members by means of conventional calculation methods is possible only in a restricted manner. The shear-analogy provides a seemingly useful method for calculating these structures. However it is only an approximation, {{particularly with regard to}} cross sections with high flexibility in terms of shear stress. This thesis treats the limitations of applying of the shearanalogy with regard to the calculation of straight and curved members with elastic compound cross section. The bending of timber lamellas generates initial bending stress. Due to the rheological behaviour of wood and the associated process of plastification within the microstructure of wood, the stress becomes partially reduced as a function of time (stress relaxation). Prior work provides contradictory information about the duration and intensity of this reduction. To shed light on these uncertainties, appropriate experiments have been conducted. To join timber lamellas to a multi-layered cross section, mechanical fasteners like screws, nails and bolts are used. The knowledge of the physical properties, like rigidity and resistance, are of significant importance for the verification of the ultimate limit states. Tests conducted in the past in order to evaluate theoretical models and to determine empirical values refer generally to connections, which differ clearly from the multi-layered connection treated here concerning the deformation and failure mechanisms. Experiments carried out provide estimation in how far the existing values can be applied to structural analysis of the present case. The theoretical model according to Johansen was adapted in an appropriate manner. The aim of the work presented here is to contribute to the clarification of several problems related to the design of spatial timber structures with elastic compound cross section. The results provide further confidence to engineers for planning and realising these challenging lightweight structures...|$|R
40|$|Neolithic monuments {{south of}} the Tagus, in Portugal, number over 1000. They are usually {{classified}} in four key types: standing stones (isolated or in groups); megalithic tombs (dolmens and passage graves); rock-cut tombs; and corbel vaulted tombs. In addition, there has been increasing evidence of an early and incipient monumentality at the late Mesolithic funerary shell mounds of the Tagus and Sado rivers. Some have timber features that may {{be considered to be}} monumental, not in terms of size but by being associated with memory. The spatial experiences of these places are transformed by specific kinds of design and tectonics (and we use the term “tectonics” in the architectural sense). Therefore, from an alternative point of view, if we attempt to categorise the monuments in accordance with these different spatial experiences, they can be classified: as open air monuments (standing stones, <b>timber</b> features at <b>shell</b> mounds); closed monuments (shell mound cemeteries, closed megalithic chambers); and open tombs (passage graves and rock-cut tombs). The available data concerning the region {{south of the}} Tagus and west of the Guadiana is still hampered by a number of difficulties in obtaining radiocarbon dates. However, it has been possible to show that the different types of monuments were probably sequential, most likely with chronological overlaps between the types: shell mounds (6000 – 5000 cal BC); then standing stones (5000 – 4000); then megalithic tombs (4500 – 3000); then rock-cut tombs (3500 – 3000); and lastly corbel vaulted tombs (3000 – 2500).

5000|$|... "There are {{likewise}} here many birds called barnacles,(barnacle geese) which nature produces in {{a wonderful}} manner, out of her ordinary course. They resemble the marsh-geese, but are smaller. Being at first, gummy excrescenses from pine-beams floating on the waters, and then enclosed in shells to secure their free growth, they hang by their beaks, like seaweeds attached to the timber. Being in progress of time well covered with feathers, they either fall into the water or take their flight in the free air, their nourishment and growth being supplied, while they are bred in this very unaccountable and curious manner, from the juices of the wood in the sea-water. I have often seen {{with my own eyes}} more than a thousand minute embryos of birds of this species on the seashore, hanging from one piece of <b>timber,</b> covered with <b>shells,</b> and, already formed. No eggs are laid by these birds after copulation, {{as is the case with}} birds in general; the hen never sits on eggs to hatch them; in no corner of the world are they seen either to pair or to build nests. Hence, in some parts of Ireland, bishops and men of religion make no scruple of eating these birds on fasting days, as not being flesh, because they are not born of flesh, But these men are curiously drawn in error. For, if anyone had eaten part of the thigh of our first parent, which was really flesh although not born of flesh I should think him not guiltless of having eaten flesh. Repent, O unhappy Jew, recollect, though late, that man was first generated from clay without being procreated by male and female; nor will your veneration for the law allow you to deny that. In the second place, woman was generated of the man, without the intervention of the other sex. The third mode of generation only by male and female, as it is the ordinary one, obstinate as you are, you admit and approve. But the fourth, from which alone came salvation, namely, birth from a woman, without union with a man, you utterly reject with perverse obstinacy, to your own perdition. Blush, O wretched man, blush! At least recur to nature, which in confirmation of the faith for our best teaching, continually produces and gives birth to new animals without union of male and female. The first creature was begotten of clay; this last is engendered of wood. The one, proceeding from the God of nature for once only, was a stupendous miracle; the other, though not less admirable, is less to be wondered at, because imitative nature often performs it. But, human nature is so constituted, that it holds nothing to be precious and admirable but what is uncommon and of rare occurrence. The rising and setting of the sun, than which there is nothing in the world more beautiful, nothing more fit to excite our wonder, we pass by without any admiration, because they are daily present to our eyes; while an eclipse of the sun fills the whole world with astonishment, because it rarely occurs. The procreation of bees from the honeycomb, by some mysterious inspiration of the breath of life, appears to be a fact of the same kind (as the origin of barnacles)" ...|$|R
