After a prolonged visit to West Prussia in 1773, Frederick informed Voltaire of his findings and accomplishments: [...] "I have abolished serfdom, reformed the savage laws, opened a canal which joins up all the main rivers; I have rebuilt those villages razed to the ground after the plague in 1709. I have drained the marshes and established a police force where none existed[...] [...] [...] it is not reasonable that the country which produced Copernicus should be allowed <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> in the barbarism that results from tyranny. Those hitherto in power have destroyed the schools, thinking that the uneducated people are easily oppressed. These provinces cannot be compared with any European country--the only parallel would be Canada." [...] But {{in a letter to his}} favorite brother, Prince Henry, Frederick admitted that the Polish provinces were economically profitable: ...|$|E
2500|$|My next {{visit was}} to Pohick Church, in the {{vicinity}} of Mt. Vernon, the seat of General Washington. It was still raining when I approached the house, and found no one there. The wide open doors invited me to enter, as they do invite, day and night through the year, not only the passing traveller, but every beast of the field and fowl of the air. These latter however seemed to have reverenced the house of God, since few marks of their pollution were to be seen throughout it. The interior of the house, having been well built, is still good. The chancel, Communion table and tables of the law [...] are still there and in good order. The roof only is decaying; and at the time I was there the rain was dropping on these sacred places and on other parts of the house. On the doors of the pews, in gilt letters, are still to be seen the names of the principal Families which once occupied them. How could I, while {{for at least an hour}} traversing those long aisles, ascending the lofty pulpit, entering the sacred chancel, forbear to ask, And is this the House of God which was built by the Washingtons, the Mc.Cartys, the Lewises, the Fairfaxes?-the house in which they used to worship the God of our fathers according to the venerable forms of the Episcopal Church, and some of whose names are still to be seen on the doors of those now deserted pews? Is this also destined <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> piecemeal away, or, when some signal is given, to become the prey of spoilers, and to be carried hither and thither and applied to every purpose under heaven? ...|$|E

60|$|The {{house had}} been untenanted for some years and was {{threatening}} <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of it. This family consisted of only two individuals--John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In age {{he may have been}} about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of Sussex.|$|E
60|$|Several of {{the light}} sails had evidently been carried off, but all the heavy canvas was left on the yards which {{remained}} in their places. The vessel was large, exceedingly strong, as was proved {{by the fact that}} she had not bilged in beaching, and apparently well found. Nothing was wanting to launch her into the ocean but machinery and force, and a crew to sail her, when she might have proceeded on her voyage as if nothing unusual had occurred. But such a restoration was hopeless, and this admirable machine, like a man cut off in his youth and vigour, had been cast upon the shores of this inhospitable region, <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> where it lay, unless broken up for the wood and iron by the wanderers of the desert.|$|E

Ay, even so, for it looms yonder calm and unconcerned when we are ushered into the world, and when we are ushered out of it, and laid <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> away under the mountain's shadow; and it will rear its bold bluffs to heaven and smile in the sunlight or frown in the gloom after we who now love to gaze upon it are blind to the solemn loveliness of its impassable face.

60|$|And if {{comforts of}} apparel, comforts of eating and drinking, and comforts of the feather-bed and easy-chair kind {{can make a}} woman happy, Mrs. Moulder was no doubt a happy woman. She had quite fallen in to the mode of life laid out for her. She {{had a little bit}} of hot kidney for breakfast at about ten; she dined at three, having seen herself to the {{accurate}} cooking of her roast fowl, or her bit of sweetbread, and always had her pint of Scotch ale. She turned over all her clothes almost every day. In the evening she read Reynolds's Miscellany, had her tea and buttered muffins, took a thimbleful of brandy and water at nine, and then went to bed. The work of her life consisted in sewing buttons on <b>to</b> <b>Moulder's</b> shirts, and seeing that his things were properly got up when he was at home. No doubt she would have done better as to the duties of the world, had the world's duties come to her. As it was, very few such had come in her direction. Her husband was away from home three-fourths of the year, and she had no children that required attention. As for society, some four or five times a year she would drink tea with Mrs. Hubbles at Clapham. Mrs. Hubbles was the wife of the senior partner in the firm, and on such occasions Mrs. Moulder dressed herself in her best, and having travelled to Clapham in an omnibus, spent the evening in dull propriety on one corner of Mrs. Hubbles's sofa. When I have added <b>to</b> this that <b>Moulder</b> every year took her to Broadstairs for a fortnight, I think that I have described with sufficient accuracy the course of Mrs. Moulder's life.|$|R
60|$|The pathway, after a {{very few}} minutes' walking, brought him close to the house, towards which, and {{especially}} towards one particular window, he directed many covert glances.

60|$|IT is a pious custom in some Catholic {{countries}} {{to honor the}} memory of saints by votive lights burnt before their pictures. The popularity of a saint, therefore, may be known {{by the number of}} these offerings. One, perhaps, is left <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> in the darkness of his little chapel; another may have a solitary lamp to throw its blinking rays athwart his effigy; while the whole blaze of adoration is lavished at the shrine of some beatified father of renown. The wealthy devotee brings his huge luminary of wax, the eager zealot, his seven-branched candlestick; and even the mendicant pilgrim is by no means satisfied that sufficient light is thrown upon the deceased unless he hangs up his little lamp of smoking oil. The consequence is, that in the eagerness to enlighten, they are often apt to obscure; and I have occasionally seen an unlucky saint almost smoked out of countenance by the officiousness of his followers.|$|E
60|$|But {{an honest}} man has nothing to fear. If we lie down in the grave, the whole man a piece of broken machinery, <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> with the clods of the valley, be it so; at least there is an end of pain, care, woes, and wants. If that part of us called mind does survive the {{apparent}} destruction of the man--away with old-wife prejudices and tales. Every age and every nation has had {{a different set of}} stories; and as the many are always weak, of consequence they have often, perhaps always, been deceived. A man conscious of having acted an honest part among his fellow-creatures--even granting that he may have been the sport at times of passions and instincts--he goes to a great unknown Being, who could have no other end in giving him existence but to make him happy, who gave him those passions and instincts, and well knows their force.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{anybody who}} cares {{to examine the}} age of Shakespeare will see that {{archaeology}} was one of its special characteristics. After that revival of the classical forms of architecture {{which was one of}} the notes of the Renaissance, and the printing at Venice and elsewhere of the masterpieces of Greek and Latin literature, had come naturally an interest in the ornamentation and costume of the antique world. Nor was it for the learning that they could acquire, but rather for the loveliness that they might create, that the artists studied these things. The curious objects that were being constantly brought to light by excavations were not left <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator, and the ennui of a policeman bored by the absence of crime. They were used as motives for the production of a new art, which was to be not beautiful merely, but also strange.|$|E
