500|$|Structural {{problems}} with the undercroft of the garden were discovered in the early 21st century and the garden was closed and fenced off in 2004. The memorial remained fenced off for seven years and fell into disrepair as the city council lacked the funds {{to carry out the}} necessary repairs, though access was granted to representatives of the Royal British Legion to lay wreaths during Remembrance Sunday services. The journalist Martin Bell remarked on the condition of the memorial in 2007: [...] "to find a war memorial in a state like <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to go to Iraq".|$|E
500|$|Having {{successfully}} completed and published the other {{books on the}} geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles. Two volumes on Lepadidae (goose barnacles) were published in 1851. While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles, Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the Royal Society had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science. Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote telling him that [...] "Pordock proposed you for the Coral Islands & Lepadidae, Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone, & then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> [...] to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Praise You In This Storm" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics following {{the release of}} Lifesong. Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today said [...] "it's vertical in focus and a typical-sounding power ballad, but it's {{not hard to imagine}} people latching on to its powerful Job-like expression of faith and hope.". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised it as [...] "sonic" [...] and called it a [...] "passionate and emotional worship experience". Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song's lyric [...] "I was sure by now <b>that</b> <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> reached down and wiped our tears away/Stepped in and saved the day/But once again, I say 'Amen,' and it's still raining" [...] would resonate with listeners.|$|E

2500|$|On {{returning}} to England in October 1655 he was arrested, and on refusing {{to submit to}} the government was allowed to retire to Essex.

[...] What can you desire more than you have? [...] It were easy,' said I, 'to tell what we would have.' [...] 'What is that, I pray? said he. [...] 'That which we fought for," [...] said I, 'that the nation might be governed by its own consent." ...|$|E

[...] This is to advise you that a decision has been made to locate the project in Clark Township. It is desired to make it entirely clear, however, that in reaching this decision this office in no manner agrees that the numerous protests received from various persons and organizations in Union Township were based upon valid premises. [...] We feel certain that if you and the other protesters had been acquainted with all of the facts in the situation, you would not have filed your protest. [...] On the contrary, it is believed <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> urged the Government to locate the project in your township. [...] Since the project will be undertaken in your immediate neighborhood, you will have ample opportunity to determine for yourselves whether or not the disadvantages to the community, as claimed by your Mayor, were based upon sound facts." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ”You professed to {{have felt}} delighted {{when you heard}} of my arrival, {{thinking}} {{that it would have}} been of great advantage for the emperor and the people; you added <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> obeyed my summons had not a previous intimation of the emperor prevented you. But you ought to have regarded an order from the Apostolic See as not less weighty than one from the emperor. ...The government of souls, which belongs to bishops, is more important than the imperial, which is only concerned with the temporal. Your assertion that I have only come to blindly excommunicate is shameless, and your offer to give me an honourable reception if I should have come exactly in the way the emperor wanted me to is contemptuous. With regards to the oaths I have taken to the emperor, I will avoid perjury by pointing out to the emperor what he has done against the unity and peace of the Church and his kingdom. With regards to the bishops, in opposing my efforts in behalf of peace, what they threaten has not been done, from the beginning of the Church.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then you {{are going}} to stay with me, lad!" [...] his uncle exclaimed, in a tone of much satisfaction. [...] "I was afraid <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> got so fond of soldiering <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thrown this over, altogether." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No harm? You {{have done}} {{your best to}} get an {{innocent}} man hanged. If it wasn't for this gentleman here, I am not sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> succeeded." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lopez had {{expected}} {{the attack and}} had endeavoured to prepare himself for it. [...] "I should <b>have</b> thought, sir, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{paid much attention to}} such statements in a newspaper." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Karel Schampers, [...] "Jonathan Meese {{can tell}} a story in such a {{gripping}} way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> the idea to doubt its truth. Especially his installations benefit from this quality." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Lundie {{raised her}} eyes, devotionally, to the ceiling. She {{looked like a}} martyr to duty. If you had seen her ladyship at <b>that</b> moment, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said yourself, [...] "A martyr to duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, she is {{made for}} you then. Sir Hugo said you were bitterly against being a singer, and I can see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> let {{yourself}} be merged in a wife, as your father was." ...|$|R

6000|$|Wyllard smiled again. [...] "Nellie and {{her husband}} are good friends of mine, but {{sometimes}} our friends are a little too officious. Anyway, it doesn't count. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> right, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> told me to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{returned}} his dragoman confidentially, [...] "in <b>that</b> sentiment <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> with <b>you</b> the whole male population.
