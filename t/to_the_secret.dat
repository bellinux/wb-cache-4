5|$|French {{settlers}} {{began to}} arrive from settlements {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi in 1764 due to fears of British control, given the transfer of eastern land to Great Britain after the Treaty of Paris.

As part of the peace negotiations to end the Seven Years' War, Spain gained control of Louisiana according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762. Due to travel times and the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768, the Spanish took official control in St. Louis only in May 1770.

5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{unveiling}} a {{new type}} of augmentation that will negate the use of Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by the Tyrants. Adam Jensen attempts to save Megan Reed and her fellow scientists, but Tyrant leader Namir critically wounds him and apparently kills Megan and the scientists.

5|$|The Great Arab Revolt {{started on}} 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the {{fighting}} reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917. By 1918, the revolt — with the Allies' support — successfully {{gained control of}} most of the territories of the Hejaz and the Levant, including Damascus. However, it failed to gain international recognition as an independent state, due mainly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement and the 1917 Balfour Declaration. This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British, including the 1915 McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, in which the British stated their willingness to recognise the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo to Aden under the rule of the Hashemites. The region was divided into French and British spheres of influence. Abdullah I, the second son of Sharif Hussein arrived from Hejaz by train in Ma'an in southern Jordan on 11 November 1920, where he was greeted by Transjordanian leaders. Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan on 11 April 1921, which then became a British protectorate.|$|E
5|$|While {{the guests}} search for clues in {{discovering}} the killer's identity, they realise {{that many of}} them had motives for wanting revenge on James Woods. Tom did not take the part of Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street due to James advising him not to, Brian had the pilot of his series messed up by James, and Quagmire lost Cheryl Tiegs due to him, while Consuela the Mexican maid says he molested her nephew, causing him to 'shoot himself in the face'. After reading a notebook belonging to Woods and found in a secret room, Mort Goldman's wife, Muriel, disappears after it is discovered that she was being blackmailed by Woods, causing everyone to suspect her as the culprit. Peter accidentally got Joe knocked out, so organizes the groups, however several of them are separated from each other due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> passages. However, Muriel turns up dead soon after by being stabbed in the back with the same knife that killed James, placing suspicion on Priscilla, who also disappeared during the commotion. Jillian's husband, Derek goes to an upper balcony to find a cell phone signal and contact the police, but is soon murdered by the unseen killer with one of Woods's Golden Globe Awards. The guests search everyone's rooms until they locate the bloodstained award and Priscilla's dead body in Tom Tucker's guest room. Tom is thus implicated as the killer and is chased and caught by Peter, Joe, Carl, Dr. Hartman, Quagmire, Seamus, and Mayor Adam West.|$|E
