All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant.

5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E

There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him.

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E

However, this is disproven when the robbers execute one of the hostages.|$|E
5|$|In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes {{should be}} avoided for consumption. Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> had suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated {{in the death of}} someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005. A report from Australia records a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after consuming a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.|$|E
5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E

5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E
5|$|Men {{were also}} {{motivated}} by positive means. New medals were instituted: the Military Cross {{was created in}} December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for enlisted men in March 1916 (although to the regret of some men, it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one grade) was instituted in 1917. By 1918, medals for bravery were often awarded within a week to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{lived long enough to}} receive it.|$|E

5|$|Ole Ewé, {{a former}} member of BOPA—another group in the Danish {{resistance}} movement—disagreed with the description of the attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the Roskildevej road. In the film, the car had Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot up the car. Ewé said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> in the car was in civilian clothes and there were no Nazi flags on the car.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} local science museum has a display of meteorites, the Fringe team is able to secure Dr. Crick (Alan Ruck), {{the man behind the}} osmium injections, and another {{paraplegic}} who has taken Dr. Crick's injections as they attempt to steal the display. With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft. He happened upon the combination of the osmium-lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air, and sought to refine a permanent solution to give his own paraplegic son the ability to walk, having promised the same to those that had died from earlier, lethal doses of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Scully becomes {{concerned}} that Mulder let Haley get away, but he dodges her queries. Later, she informs a counter-terrorism task force headed by Skinner and U.S. Attorney Leamus (Sam Anderson) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{in the park}} {{was killed by a}} biological agent. Skinner explains that August Bremer (Michael MacRae), the leader of the New Spartans, is involved in an internal power struggle with Haley. Scully follows Mulder and sees him meeting with Haley. When she tries to pursue them, she is surrounded by government agents and brought before Skinner and Leamus, who inform her that Mulder is infiltrating the group as an undercover agent.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle of al-Qaeda. Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was not active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official.|$|E
5|$|The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called {{attention}} to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state-run television, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who self-immolated on the square {{was not the same}} person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV. It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance the theory that the self-immolators were actors.|$|E
