25|$|Losartan, valsartan, candesartan, irbesartan, <b>telmisartan</b> and {{olmesartan}} all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> is {{the only}} ARB that can cross the blood–brain barrier and can {{therefore}} inhibit centrally mediated effects of Ang II, contributing to even better blood pressure control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telmisartan,</b> {{which was}} {{discovered}} and developed in 1991 by Boehringer Ingelheim, has carboxylic acid as the biphenyl acidic group. It has the longest elimination half-life of the ARBs or about 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|Other {{attributes}} of ARBs are also under investigation, {{such as the}} positive effects of <b>telmisartan</b> on lipid and glucose metabolism and losartan's effects of lowering uric acid levels. Such effects might lead to new indications for these drugs but further research is needed.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan and {{olmesartan}} {{have the}} highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan. Valsartan, <b>telmisartan</b> and EXP 3174 have similar affinities that are about ten-fold {{less than that of}} candesartan. Losartan has the least affinity. ARBs' affinity for the AT2 receptor is generally much lower (or around 10,000 times less) than for the AT1 subtype. Therefore they allow unhindered stimulation of the AT2 receptor.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs {{have the}} same {{mechanism}} of action and differences in their potency {{can be related to}} their different pharmacokinetic profiles. A few clinical head-to-head comparisons have been made and candesartan, irbesartan and <b>telmisartan</b> appear to be slightly more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure. This difference may be related to different strengths of activity at the receptor level, such as duration and strength of receptor binding.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. <b>Telmisartan</b> is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tetrazole}} {{group has}} been successfully replaced by a carboxylic acid group {{as is the case}} with <b>telmisartan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> has a {{carboxylic}} acid at the 2-position of the biphenyl-methyl group {{and is more}} potent than the tetrazole analogue.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{study with}} 18 patients, <b>telmisartan</b> can replace {{valsartan}} and candesartan for hypertensive patients which have also diabetes type II because <b>telmisartan</b> has additional advantages of insulin sensitivity and antiatherosclerosis through probably its effects on PPAR-y.|$|E
50|$|The Ongoing <b>Telmisartan</b> Alone and in {{combination}} with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) {{was one of the}} largest ARB clinical studies ever undertaken; 25,620 patients from 733 centres in 41 countries were randomised for 5.5 years of treatment of either <b>telmisartan,</b> the ACE inhibitor ramipril or a combination of the two. The study aimed to investigate the role of <b>telmisartan</b> in cardiovascular (CV) protection through the primary composite outcome of death from CV causes, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for heart failure, in high CV risk patients.|$|E

50|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> is {{indicated}} {{in the treatment of}} essential hypertension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> is {{contraindicated}} during pregnancy. Like {{other drugs}} affecting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), <b>telmisartan</b> can cause birth defects, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. It {{is not known}} whether the drug passes into the breast milk. Also it is contraindicated in bilateral renal artery stenosis in which it can cause renal failure.|$|E
50|$|Losartan, valsartan, candesartan, irbesartan, <b>telmisartan</b> and {{olmesartan}} all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E
50|$|Ramipril {{was found}} to have similar results as <b>telmisartan,</b> an {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker.|$|E
50|$|The {{study showed}} <b>telmisartan</b> was as {{effective}} as ramipril but with lower rates of cough and angioedema, which led to fewer discontinuations. The combination group experienced similar efficacy, but with increased risk of hypotensive symptoms. Moreover, in a patient population selected to tolerate ACE inhibitors, <b>telmisartan</b> was shown to be better tolerated and associated with higher treatment compliance than ramipril.|$|E
50|$|Some {{evidence}} exists {{to suggest that}} the Angiotensin II receptor blocker drug <b>telmisartan</b> will prevent corneal neovascularization.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} ONTARGET study, {{patients}} who could not tolerate ACE inhibitors {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either <b>telmisartan</b> or placebo as part of the <b>Telmisartan</b> Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) study. An accompanying editorial comments: [...] "Overall, data supporting use of angiotensin-receptor blockers to prevent vascular events in various cardiovascular groups, other than heart failure, are incomplete. TRANSCEND's results challenge the non-inferiority shown in ONTARGET and suggest no more than a modest effect, if any at all." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> is an {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker {{that shows}} high {{affinity for the}} angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), with a binding affinity 3000 times greater for AT1 than AT2.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> (INN) [...] is an {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker, ARB) used in {{the management}} of hypertension. It was discovered by Boehringer Ingelheim and launched in 1999 as Micardis.|$|E
50|$|Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, valsartan, fimasartan and azilsartan {{include the}} {{tetrazole}} group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, and <b>telmisartan</b> include {{one or two}} imidazole groups.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telmisartan,</b> {{which was}} {{discovered}} and developed in 1991 by Boehringer Ingelheim, has carboxylic acid as the biphenyl acidic group. It has the longest elimination half-life of the ARBs or about 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Formylphenylboronic acid {{is used in}} Suzuki couplings, {{for example}} in the build up of {{pharmacologically}} active biphenyl compounds such as a precursor of the antihypertensive AT1 antagonist <b>telmisartan</b> in an improved synthesis: ...|$|E
50|$|Telmisartan's {{activity}} at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) receptor has prompted speculation around its potential as a sport doping agent {{as an alternative to}} GW 501516. <b>Telmisartan</b> activates PPAR-δ receptors in several tissues.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study of}} 108 {{patients}} with early morning blood pressure more than 135/85 mmHg, Candesartan showed significantly early morning Blood Pressure decreased over amlodipine, and also to ARBs, valsartan, losartan, <b>telmisartan,</b> but not olmesartan.|$|E
50|$|The Prevention Regimen For Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) study {{investigated}} therapy with <b>telmisartan</b> initiated soon after an ischemic stroke and continued for 2.5 years. This treatment {{did not significantly}} lower the rate of recurrent stroke, major cardiovascular events, or diabetes.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{mechanism}} of action, <b>telmisartan</b> increases blood potassium levels. Combination with potassium preparations or potassium-sparing diuretics could cause hyperkalaemia (excessive potassium levels). Combination with NSAIDs, especially {{in patients with}} impaired kidney function, has a risk of causing (usually reversible) kidney failure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Telmisartan</b> {{has been}} found to have {{activity}} against a variety of cancers in vitro, including prostate, renal, colon, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. [...] The mechanisms of telmisartan's anti-cancer activity have been found to include up-regulation of proliferator-activated-receptor (PPAR) pathway, Bcl-2, and caspase activation.|$|E
50|$|Its {{portfolio}} of treatments for cardiovascular disease include ACE inhibitors to treat {{high blood pressure}} (including enalapril and perindopril), sartans for those unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors (including losartan, valsartan and <b>telmisartan),</b> statins to reduce high cholesterol levels (including simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) and clopidogrel, a blood clot inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to blocking the RAS, <b>telmisartan</b> {{acts as a}} selective modulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a central regulator of insulin and glucose metabolism. It is believed that telmisartan’s dual mode of action may provide protective benefits against the vascular and renal damage caused by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).|$|E
50|$|Candesartan and {{olmesartan}} {{have the}} highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan.
