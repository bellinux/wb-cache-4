5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment</b> has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep and bear arms as protected under <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment.</b> However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>amendment</b> to the {{articles}} of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the free-floating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy. The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution's capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation. This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point {{in the evolution of}} the Fund's mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries' overall economic policies.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the modern utility of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> guarantee of “the {{right to keep}} and bear arms” in light of the phenomenon of modern crime, particularly black-on-black violence in urban America. Although many advocates of gun control have argued that crime in modern cities is a reason for modifying or severely truncating the right to have arms, the Authors argue that the right to have arms and <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> notion of a universal militia can be the basis of a new partnership between police and citizens in urban America. This new partnership can, if properly developed, be a useful tool in fighting crime in inner-city communities...|$|R
25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the U.S. Constitution, which protects {{the right to keep}} and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment.</b> Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{to keep and bear arms}} for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E
