5|$|What came to {{be known}} as the Long Parliament also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were {{religious}} in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan-sympathizing members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, but there was little agreement over what shape <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> take. Later in 1640, the Root and Branch petition was presented to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15,000 Londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the Tower of London as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished.|$|E

25|$|The {{creation}} of a Christian canon was probably a response to career of the heretic Marcion (c. 85–160), who established a canon of his own with just one gospel, the gospel of Luke, which he edited to fit his own theology. The Muratorian canon, the earliest surviving list of books considered (by its own author at least) to form Christian scripture, included Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and Irenaeus of Lyons went further, stating {{that there must be}} four gospels and only four because there were four corners of the Earth and thus <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>should</b> have four pillars.|$|E

Ioannidis {{together}} with another theologian, Amilkas Alivizatos, contributed significantly to the debates that led to the drafting of the [...] "Toronto Statement", a foundational document which facilitated Orthodox participation in the organization and constitutes today its ecclesiological charter. Ioannidis was against the view that <b>the</b> Orthodox <b>church</b> <b>should</b> participate in discussions about Dogmatic theology. On the other hand, he believed that the discussions among the representatives of <b>the</b> various <b>Churches</b> <b>should</b> focus on social and political issues.

According to a nationwide poll of 2,242 U.S. adults surveyed online in September 2005 by Harris Interactive (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to sampling errors, non-response,etc.), 90% of U.S. Catholics supported the use of birth control/contraceptives. A survey conducted in 2015 by the Pew Research Center among 5,122 U.S. adults (including 1,016 self-identified Catholics) stated 76% of U.S. Catholics thought that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> allow Catholics to use birth control.|$|E
25|$|The early Anabaptists {{believed}} that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor {{by the use of}} the sword; Christianity was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it. Protestant ecclesial leaders such as Hubmaier and Hofmann preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ("believer's baptism") instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the Albigenses in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. Thomas Müntzer was involved in the German Peasants' War. Andreas Karlstadt disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers. Kaspar Schwenkfeld and Sebastian Franck were influenced by German mysticism and spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|Pope Innocent III {{represented}} the absolute zenith of papal {{power in the}} Middle Ages. Among the many reforms he established was the banning of any ecclesiastic to have income {{from more than one}} church or parish. Bracton had received a dispensation to receive the proceeds from three. This indicates his special position within the Church political structure. Innocent III exercised more power than any of his predecessors, or his successors. He famously placed England under interdict during the reign of John of England. During and after the Fourth Lateran Council, Innocent III proclaimed that all tithes to <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>should</b> take precedence over any taxes imposed by a state. This was controversial. He also excluded all lay interference (including matters of civil and criminal law). He affirmed the right of Rome to review any and all important legal cases. This made appeal to the Pope more attractive and easier to obtain than in previous generations. He gave the Chancery an improved and more efficient organisation. All this occurred in the generation before Bracton, and still was rancorous in his time.|$|E
50|$|During the Revolution, Saint Thomas, {{like most}} Episcopal Churches, fell upon hard times. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> was {{probably}} closed {{for a number}} of years as were many others in the area. The parish was not served again by a resident minister until the Rev. William W. Wheeler began his work in 1786 and continued until 1798 when he was asked to leave due to his political opinions. At a meeting on August 6, 1798 the parish voted among other things, that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> wardens <b>should</b> notify Mr. Wheeler that the said Society would have no further service for him as minister of said Society; that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> wardens <b>should</b> go and demand the Library (Coram) and the records belonging to the church; that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> wardens <b>should</b> demand possession of the Glebe and make a settlement with Mr. Wheeler.|$|R

More recently, <b>the</b> <b>churches,</b> while re-affirming {{that the people of}} God should marry only the people of God, stated that in any breach of this, they would discriminate between rebellion and weakness of faith, and only excommunicate where a spirit of rebellion in going against the counsel of Scripture was evident.|$|R

25|$|The PCA has {{its roots}} in {{theological}} controversies over liberalism in Christianity and neo-orthodoxy that had been a point of contention in the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. (formerly the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America) which had split from the mainline Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A along regional lines {{at the beginning of the}} Civil War. While the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy had led to a split in the PC-USA in the mid 1930s, leading to the formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Bible Presbyterian Church, the PCUS remained intact. However, beginning in 1942, as the PCUS began to experiment with confessional revision, and later, when neo-orthodoxy and liberalism began to become influential in the PCUS' seminaries, and attempts were made to merge with the more liberal PC-USA and its successor, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., renewal groups began to be formed, including the Presbyterian Churchmen United, which had been formed by more than 500 ministers and ran 3/4 page statements of their beliefs in 30 newspapers, the Presbyterian Evangelistic Fellowship, conducted revivals in PCUS churches, the Concerned Presbyterians, and the Presbyterian Churchmen United (PCU), an organization of conservative pastors in the Southern Presbyterian Church. They sought to reaffirm the Westminster Confession of Faith as the fullest and clearest exposition of biblical faith, which many conservatives felt that presbyteries had been violating by receiving ministers who refused to affirm the virgin birth and bodily resurrection, and to expect all pastors and leaders to affirm the inerrancy of scripture. Opponents of the merger took specific issue with the United Presbyterian Church's adherence to the Auburn Affirmation and the Confession of 1967; the Southern Presbyterian denomination rejected the adoption of these confessions as official standards, noting amorphous biblical doctrine, lax sexual ethic, and conversations with other church bodies that rejected the Reformed faith, such as those explored by the Consultation on Church Union. They also felt <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> disavow the ordination of women.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Cross {{church was}} built in 1929 from the master of church {{building}} Martin Weber and is {{at the edge of}} the housing development at the Bornheimer Hang. Martin Weber built also the churches St. Bonifatius in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen in 1927 and Heilig-Geist in Frankfurt-Riederwald in 1931. The planned community center at the end of the Wittelsbacher Allee was not built so there was enough space for building the new church. The Holy Cross Church was the second catholic church in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The parish was an outsourcing of the later neighbour fold St. Josef, the first catholic church in Bornheim. Reason was the expansion of the quarter Bornheim eastward at the Bornheimer Hang with the new settlement of the town planner Ernst May who built many new apartment buildings. This caused a growing number of Catholics who were living in the quarter. On 3 August 1927 a jury decided in a competition for the draft with the name slope crown from the master of church building Martin Weber. The three other participators of the competition were Hans and Christoph Rummel (Frankfurt), Richard Steidle (Munich) and Robert B. Witte (Dresden). There were several specifications for the architects like for example the front of the steeple at the Wittelsbacher Allee, between 700 and 800 seats, a high altar and two side altars and an organ loft for 150 people. The building model was called by Martin Weber slope crown, since <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> crown the Bornheimer Hang (slope). On 19 February 1928 the construction work began with the first cut of the spade. The 18. March 1928 was the day of the laying of the foundation stone. The topping-out ceremony was celebrated on 14 September 1928. On 25 August 1929 the church was inaugurated by Ludwig Maria Hugo, the Bishop of the Diocese of Mainz. The name was selected, since medieval Frankfurt possessed several the holy cross dedicated places. One of it was the chapel of the hospital to the holy cross which was donated in 1343 by Wicker Frosch. It formed with the chapel of the cloister of St. Katharinen which {{was built in}} 1354 a small double church, the predecessor building of the today's Evangelical-Lutheran Katharinen church. Until 1950 were the Holy Cross parish financially still a part of the St. Josef parish with which it has a common church executive committee.|$|E
500|$|Lang's liberal {{conservatism}} {{enabled him}} to associate easily with Socialist leaders such as Will Crooks and George Lansbury, successive mayors of Poplar; {{he was responsible for}} bringing the latter back to regular communion in the Church. In 1905 he and Lansbury joined the Central London Unemployed Body, set up by the government to tackle the region's unemployment problems. [...] That same year Lang took as his personal assistant a young Cambridge graduate and clergyman's son, Dick Sheppard, who became a close friend and confidante. Sheppard was eventually ordained, becoming a radical clergyman and founder of the Peace Pledge Union. [...] Lang believed that socialism was a growing force in British life, and at a Church Congress in Great Yarmouth in 1907 he speculated on how <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>should</b> respond to this. His remarks reached The New York Times, which warned that modern socialism was often equated with unrest, that [...] "the cry of the demagogue is in the air" [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>should</b> not heed this cry.|$|E

50|$|Andrews and Cottrell shared {{similarly}} views regarding church organization. They {{believed that}} <b>the</b> Christian <b>Church</b> <b>should</b> use <b>the</b> early <b>church</b> record {{to define their}} efforts to organize <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> They understood this to put most of the responsibility on <b>the</b> local <b>church</b> for ownership and administration of Gospel work.|$|R

500|$|While {{there is}} an {{identifiable}} mainstream within the Churches of Christ, there are also significant variations within the fellowship. [...] The approach taken to restoring the New Testament church has focused on [...] "methods and procedures" [...] such as church organization, the form of worship, and how <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> function. As a result, most divisions among Churches of Christ {{have been the result}} of [...] "methodological" [...] disputes. These are meaningful to members of this movement because of the seriousness with which they take the goal of [...] "restoring the form and structure of the primitive church".|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1807 a northerly storm {{combined}} with a high tide to bring erosion of the cliff on which the church stood to within the churchyard, destroying [...] "ten yards [...] of the wall around the churchyard, not ten yards from {{the foundation of the}} church". Sea defences had been in place since at least 1783, but although they had been costly to build their design had led to further undermining of the cliff. Two further schemes were devised by Sir Thomas Page and John Rennie to preserve the cliff by means of new sea defences, Rennie's being estimated to cost £8,277. Instead, at a vestry meeting on 12January 1808, and at the instigation of the vicar, Christopher Naylor, it was decided that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> be demolished. The decision was reached by vote among eight of the leading residents of Reculver and Hoath, including the vicar: the votes were evenly split, so the vicar used his casting vote in favour of demolition. Naylor applied to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton, for permission to demolish, arguing that [...] "in all human probability the parishionsers [...] shortly be deprived of a place for the interment of their dead." [...] The archbishop commissioned neighbouring clergy and landowners to assess the situation, and they reported in March 1809 that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> be demolished [...] "to save the materials for the erection of another church." ...|$|E
500|$|Crowds {{were drawn}} to the {{northeast}} corner of the Churchyard, St Paul's Cross, where open-air preaching took place. It was there in the Cross Yard in 1549 that radical Protestant preachers incited a mob to destroy many of the cathedral's interior decorations. In 1554, in an attempt to end inappropriate practices taking place in the nave, the Lord Mayor decreed that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>should</b> return to its original purpose as a religious building, issuing a writ stating that the selling of horses, beer and [...] "other gross wares" [...] was [...] "to the great dishonour and displeasure of Almighty God, and the great grief also and offence of all good and well-disposed persons".|$|E

5000|$|Examining how to {{establish}} a new order, Hitler argued that the greatness of powerful organizations was reliant on intolerance of all others, so that the greatness of Christianity arose from the [...] "unrelenting and fanatical proclamation and defence of its own teaching." [...] Hitler rejected a view that Christianity brought civilization to the Germanic peoples, however: [...] "It is therefore outrageously unjust to speak of the pre-Christian Germans as barbarians who had no civilization. They never have been such." [...] Foreshadowing his conflict with <b>the</b> Catholic <b>Church</b> over euthanasia in Nazi Germany, Hitler wrote that <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>should</b> give up missionary work in Africa, and concentrate on convincing Europeans that is more pleasing to God if they adopt orphans rather than [...] "give life to a sickly child that will be a cause of suffering and unhappiness to all." [...] <b>The</b> Christian <b>churches</b> <b>should</b> forget about their own differences and focus on the issue of [...] "racial contamination," [...] he declared.|$|R
