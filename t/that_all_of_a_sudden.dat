[...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous <b>that</b> ... <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|In the 2012 presidential campaign, {{during which}} he {{acknowledged}} {{it was unlikely that}} he would win the Republican Party nomination, Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs. He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught. So, let's support anybody at all … even if they disagree with everything that we do." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, <b>that,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. <b>That</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 Moore {{declared}} {{himself to be}} a ceremonial magician. The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics. He did so through Image Comics, widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style, graphic violence, and scantily clad large-breasted women, something that horrified many of his fans. His first work published by Image, an issue of the series Spawn, was soon followed by the creation of his own mini-series, 1963, which was [...] "a pastiche of Jack Kirby stories drawn for Marvel in the sixties, with their rather overblown style, colourful characters and cosmic style". According to Moore, [...] "after I'd done the 1963 stuff I'd become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I'd been away [...] <b>That</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> it seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story, just lots of big, full-page pin-up sort of pieces of artwork.

One of them was that I should live on good nourishing diet. The other was, that I should keep my mind easy.|$|E
60|$|In his {{own room}} Mr. Bosengate sat at his wide open window, smoking a cigarette; there was no light. Moths went past, the moon was {{creeping}} up. He sat very calm, puffing the smoke out in to the night air. Curious thing-life! Curious world! Curious forces in it--making one do {{the opposite of what}} one wished; always--always making one do the opposite, it seemed! The furtive light from that creeping moon was getting hold of things down there, stealing in among the boughs of the trees. 'There's something ironical,' he thought, 'which walks about. Things don't come off as you think they will. I meant, I tried but one doesn't change like <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> it seems. Fact is, life's too big a thing for one! All the same, I'm not the man I was yesterday--not quite!' He closed his eyes, and in one of those flashes of vision which come when the senses are at rest, he saw himself as it were far down below--down {{on the floor of a}} street narrow as a grave, high as a mountain, a deep dark slit of a street walking down there, a black midget of a fellow, among other black midgets--his wife, and the little soldier, the judge, and those jury chaps--fantoches straight up on their tiny feet, wandering down there in that dark, infinitely tall, and narrow street. 'Too much for one!' he thought; 'Too high for one--no getting on top of it. We've got to be kind, and help one another, and not expect too much, and not think too much. That's--all!' And, squeezing out his cigarette, he took six deep breaths of the night air, and got into bed.|$|E
60|$|Ferdinand Armine {{was always}} {{looked up to}} at Grandison, and always spoken of by her {{grandfather}} as a very fine fellow indeed; a wonderfully fine fellow, his favourite grandson, Ferdinand Armine: and now he had arrived. His knock was heard at the door, his step was on the stairs, the door opened, and certainly his first appearance did not disappoint his cousin Kate. So handsome, so easy, so gentle, and so cordial; they were all the best friends in a moment. Then he embraced his father with such fervour, and kissed his mother with such fondness: {{it was evident that}} he had an excellent heart. His arrival indeed, was a revolution. Their mourning days seemed at once to disappear; and although they of course entered society very little, and never frequented any public amusement, it seemed to Katherine <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> she lived in a round of delightful gaiety. Ferdinand was so amusing and so accomplished! He sang with her, he played with her; he was always projecting long summer rides and long summer walks. Then his conversation was so different from everything to which she had ever listened. He had seen so many things and so many persons; everything that was strange, and everybody that was famous. His opinions were so original, his illustrations so apt and lively, his anecdotes so inexhaustible and sparkling! Poor inexperienced, innocent Katherine! Her cousin in four-and-twenty hours found it quite impossible {{to fall in love with}} her; and so he determined to make her fall in love with him. He quite succeeded. She adored him. She did not believe that there was anyone in the world so handsome, so good, and so clever. No one, indeed, who knew Ferdinand Armine could deny that he was a rare being; but, had there been any acute and unprejudiced observers who had known him in his younger and happier hours, they would perhaps have remarked some difference in his character and conduct, and not a favourable one. He was indeed more brilliant, but not quite so interesting as in old days; far more dazzling, but not quite so apt to charm. No one could deny his lively talents and his perfect breeding, but there was a restlessness about him, an excited and exaggerated style, which might have made some suspect that his demeanour was an effort, and that under a superficial glitter, by which so many are deceived, there was no little deficiency of the genuine and sincere. Katherine Grandison, however, was not one of those profound observers. She was easily captivated. Ferdinand, who really did not feel sufficient emotion to venture upon a scene, made his proposals to her when they were riding in a green lane: the sun just setting, and the evening star glittering through a vista. The lady blushed, and wept, and sobbed, and hid her fair and streaming face; but the result was as satisfactory as our hero could desire. The young equestrians kept their friends in the crescent at least two hours for dinner, and then had no appetite for the repast when they had arrived.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. RoboCup is an {{international}} robot soccer competition that has been running since 1997. <b>A</b> frequent criticism <b>of</b> any such competition is <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team's development is narrowly focussed on a very spe-ci c task and consequently, little contribution is made to science. In this paper, we describe our involvement in the RoboCup four-legged robot league and show how the competition has, indeed, resulted in contribu-tions beyond robot soccer. We describe innovations in vision, localisation and locomotion. In particular, we discuss the stimulus that RoboCup has given to system integration and cooperative behaviour between multiple agents. ...|$|R

40|$|In The Case for Animal Rights, Tom Regan argues <b>that</b> <b>all</b> {{subjects}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{life have}} equal inherent value and an equal right {{to not be}} caused harm.

This implies <b>that</b> <b>all</b> subjects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> life have an equal right not to be killed. One of the most important challenges to this view stems from the thought that the value of life is greater for more psychologically complex beings. This has led philosophers like Mary Anne Warren to hold that some beings have a stronger right to life than others. I argue that it makes sense to think that life has greater value for some beings than others. However, I aim to reconcile this position with Regan 2 ̆ 7 s view <b>that</b> <b>all</b> subjects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> life possess a strong right to life. Along the way, I point out some of Regan 2 ̆ 7 s key contributions to our understanding of the mental lives and moral status of animals...|$|R

30|$|The dichotomous Rasch model 2 is a psychometric {{model for}} {{binomial}} (dichotomous) data.

It further demands subgroup homogeneity, which means <b>that</b> <b>all</b> items <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test measure the same underlying construct across different subgroups (e.g., girls and boys). Moreover, the Rasch model claims that every item must contribute equally to the estimated ability level, implying equal item discrimination and thus, the absence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item discrimination parameter.
