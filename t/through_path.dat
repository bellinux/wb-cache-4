5000|$|The first example fails the series-series test {{because the}} <b>through</b> <b>path</b> between the lower {{terminals}} of 2-port #1 short-circuit {{part of the}} circuitry in 2-port #2. The second example passes the series-series test. The 2-ports {{are the same as}} in the first example, but 2-port #2 has been flipped or equivalently the choice of terminals to be placed in series has changed. The result is that the <b>through</b> <b>path</b> between the lower terminals of 2-port #1 simply provide a parallel path to the <b>through</b> <b>path</b> between the upper terminals of 2-port #2. The third example {{is the same as the}} first example, except that it passes the Brune test because ideal isolating transformers have been placed at the right side terminals which break the through paths.|$|E

50|$|While {{not located}} in the hippocampus, grid cells from within the medial entorhinal cortex have also been implicated {{in the process of}} path integration, {{actually}} playing the role of the path integrator while place cells display the output of the information gained <b>through</b> <b>path</b> integration. The results of path integration are then later used by the hippocampus to generate the cognitive map. The cognitive map likely exists on a circuit involving much more than just the hippocampus, even if it is primarily based there. Other than the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and parietal cortex have also been implicated in the generation of cognitive maps.|$|E

5000|$|The Hochblassen can be {{climbed from}} the Höllentalanger Hut (Höllentalangerhütte, [...] ) to the {{northwest}} via the Grießkarscharte (with safety cables) and the Nordgrat in, according to the literature, an easy climb (no <b>through</b> <b>path),</b> in places difficulty up to UIAA grade II. The duration of this tour is just under nine hours. On the north and southern sides of the mountain there are serious and demanding climbing routes of UIAA grade V difficulty and upwards. In addition, it can be ascended over the Hochblassen Ostgrat (or Blassengrat). This ridge is about 3 km long and it takes about 6 hours. There are sections classed as UIAA grade III, {{but most of it}} is grade II or walkable.|$|E
50|$|In June 2006, both {{buildings}} on Bay Street {{attached to this}} property were emptied of tenants and by December 11, 2006, both buildings had been taken down, with {{the north and west}} facades of the National Building (347 Bay) being removed for incorporation into the new buildings. The National Building had only recently been designated a heritage building under the Ontario Heritage Act (Part IV). By December 2006, dismantling of the service shaft stump was complete. Construction of the PATH tunnel north from Scotia Plaza through the Bay Adelaide Centre started in fall 2007. Completion of this section closed the last remaining gap in the north-south route <b>through</b> <b>PATH</b> that parallels Yonge Street, thus eliminating the need to double back from Bay Street to get between buildings located on the eastern edge of PATH.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Taking Jinan Yellow River Bridge as an example, using 3 D {{finite element}} method, {{displacement}} {{and behavior of}} four-line high-speed railway bridge with two main trusses, K-shaped brace and middle suspender is studied. The results show that transversal wave of displacement of floor system is significant, and the difference of the displacement in transversal direction reaches 6 mm. The causes includes: large distance between two main trusses, large stiffness of stringers, longitudinal stiffeners and crossbeams, weak transversal stiffeners which do not connect to lower chords. About 90 % of the loads are transferred to the crossbeam <b>through</b> <b>path</b> 1 and about 60 % to 80 % of these loads through K-shaped braces.

40|$|Thyroxine is an {{endocrine}} hormone that regulates cellular and organismic metabolism. Current research on thyroxine has primarily examined its adaptive potential and genetic inheritance patterns. To date, no studies {{have attempted to}} investigate {{the interaction between the}} genetic and environmental components of thyroxine variation. This approach is useful because hormones are on feedback regulation; thus interaction occurs between the environment and gene expression. The purposes of this research are to characterize the genetic and environmental components of thyroxine variation using univariate statistics and to estimate the genetic and cultural heritabilities <b>through</b> <b>path</b> analysis. For univariate analyses, analyses of variance are used {{to determine whether or not}} age, sex, or community affiliation are covariates of thyroxine level. Significant differences existed in thyroxine level based on sex and community affiliation (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The genetic and environmental components of thyroxine variation were partitioned <b>through</b> <b>path</b> analysis. Heritability was estimated at 0. 317 ± 0. 109 for the genetic component and at 0. 060 ± 0. 029 for the environmental component.
