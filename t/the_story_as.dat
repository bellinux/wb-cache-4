5|$|Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> a stage play or musical than read the book. Eric Lott, in his book Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production, {{estimates}} that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's growing {{interest}} in art was reflected in <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>as</b> he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|E

5000|$|Writer {{and critic}} Steve Bodio {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "some straight forward," [...] and [...] "some supernatural" [...] and [...] "uncanny" [...] {{in the line}} of tales by T.H. White from the 1930s and Geoffrey Household from the 1950s. Bodio describes <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> having a [...] "touch of terror." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{book was}} edited by Kevin J. Anderson, who wrote one of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the novella, in which the physical transformation of Jekyll into Hyde is revealed near the end, most dramatic adaptations show it early in the play, because the audience is familiar with <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>As</b> one of its first adapters, Sullivan worked {{in an environment where}} the transformation would still shock the audience, and he held the reveal until the third act.|$|E
5|$|She was {{eventually}} revealed as a hoax. A young man, his advances rebuffed by a woman, had started <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> {{a means of}} revenge. It was reported that the stream of visitors wishing to meet the Pig-faced Lady became so annoying, the young woman in question was forced to move house.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Troilus' romance {{developed}} {{within the context}} of the male-centred conventions of courtly love and thus the focus of sympathy was to be Troilus and not his beloved. As different authors recreated the romance, they would interpret it in ways affected both by the perspectives of their own times and their individual preoccupations. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> it would later develop through the works of Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare is summarised below.|$|E
5000|$|Dobson Books {{published}} {{a collection of}} <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Unorthodox Engineers [...] in November 1979.|$|R
5000|$|Astounding {{reviewer}} P. Schuyler Miller praised <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> providing [...] "powerful {{and lasting}} stimulation to the imagination." ...|$|R
5000|$|Galaxy {{reviewer}} Floyd C. Gale praised <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "very high in inventiveness, {{ingenuity and}} reader appeal." ...|$|R
5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, {{was inspired by}} it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> (<b>as</b> in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E
50|$|Don Martin {{illustrated}} all <b>the</b> Captain Klutz <b>stories.</b> Numerous {{writers were}} credited for <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> A listing of <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> credited writers, follows.|$|R
5000|$|Astounding {{reviewer}} P. Schuyler Miller praised <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "representative {{examples of}} de Campian whimsy and reverse plot-twists." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fast {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "about <b>the</b> general childishness of man, {{the only}} {{form of life}} that refuses to grow up." ...|$|R
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>As</b> a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} {{his vision of the}} 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by watching {{and listening to}} episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing the direction of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E
50|$|Note: Combining <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Solomon <b>as</b> a whole reveals {{allows one}} to view <b>the</b> <b>story</b> holistically <b>as</b> a motif for tawhid and the believers.|$|R
50|$|Chronologically, <b>the</b> short <b>stories</b> {{collected}} <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Coming of Conan are {{the earliest}} in Gnome's Conan series; <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> collected <b>as</b> Conan <b>the</b> Barbarian follow.|$|R
25|$|He {{followed}} {{this with a}} twist-in-the-tail anthology series Thriller (ITV 1973-1976; aka Menace), for which he wrote all <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> well as 38 of the scripts.|$|R
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>As</b> part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted to add more to <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed drawing {{the characters in the}} end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> soon as possible.|$|E
50|$|Mrs. Thayer: {{the real}} estate agent, she is aware that there is {{something}} unusual about the Aylwood place but she tries to dismiss <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> local gossip.|$|R
5000|$|Galaxy {{reviewer}} Groff Conklin described <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "three creaking classics [...] [...] [...] fun to read, but rococo antiques without believable characters, human relations, even logical plots." [...] Boucher and McComas {{dismissed the}} book as [...] "a hopelessly outdated set of novelets [...] [...] [...] of concern {{only to those who}} wish to observe the awkward larval stage of a major figure in science fiction." [...] P. Schuyler Miller described <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "old-fashioned fun which Campbell no longer takes any more seriously than you need to." ...|$|R
5000|$|Delia Falconer {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "patchy collection, {{much less}} satisfying than Close Range". [...] <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> set in Hell {{have also been}} criticized as—while being witty and well-written—ill-fitted to a book of Wyoming stories.|$|R
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>As</b> a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>as</b> well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained by falling out of a tree. In June 2006, Verbinski finally managed to make room in Richards' schedule to shoot that September.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a {{combination}} between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system {{that is used to}} increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or to learn a new skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>as</b> well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} a graphic {{exploration}} and analysis of Toni Morrison s fiction. It attempts to concretize the imagined spaces of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> well as map the unusual and idiosyncratic details of the architecture. There is an awareness {{that there is an}} origin for her architecture in real life, however what is recounted in <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> is a mutated architecture that is a product of Morrison s memory and imagination. Graphic and literary analysis look for the symbols and elements that are recurrent in <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> <b>as</b> a way to grasp an idea of an architecture that is part of a particular and potent black fiction...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing the {{original}} edition for Galaxy, Groff Conklin described <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> [...] "completely enchanting -- wise, mad, fantastic, funny, warmly human and often very moving." [...] P. Schuyler Miller compared <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> to Lord Dunsany's [...] "Jorkens" [...] tales.|$|R
50|$|The two epigraphs that Gogol {{attaches}} to Mirgorod reveal {{his intention to}} present <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> a cycle: “Mirgorod is an extremely small town near the Khorol river. It has one rope factory, one brick works, four water mills and forty five windmills” and “Although in Mirgorod bread rings are baked from black dough, they are very tasty,” ostensibly taken from works entitled Zyablovsky’s Geography and Notes of a Traveler respectively. Gogol conceived of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>as</b> circular like a Mirgorod bread ring, and endeavored to exhaustively display in them the panorama of traditional Ukrainian provincial life.|$|R
