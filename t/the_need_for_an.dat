Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E

5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> international consensus on risk assignment {{has also been}} recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also {{commonly referred to as}} MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, {{the absence of a}} central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of a}} different military doctrine. <b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{improved}} CSBS {{was known}} in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF {{was working on the}} Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E

5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, wrote of <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip {{he took in}} the previous October {{to look for a}} new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E

The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Swedish Air Force saw <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{interceptor}} that could reach enemy bombers {{at a higher}} altitude than the J 29 Tunnan that formed {{the backbone of the}} fighter force. A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s (equivalent to the Mk 4) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955. The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm. The J 34 was armed with four 30mm (1.18in) cannon and two Sidewinders. The Swedish Air Force's aerobatic team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s. The J 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings, F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in Ängelholm, during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative to the size of the tsunami that followed.|$|E
5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria {{it was decided}} that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E

5|$|The McDonnell {{design was}} {{therefore}} reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company {{received a letter}} of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.|$|E
5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{international}} standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 {{by a committee}} headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds. The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, {{making it one of}} the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. IUPAC as such was established in 1919. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.|$|E

Recognizing <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E
