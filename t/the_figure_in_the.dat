5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve {{to make him a}} mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of}} the mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E

25|$|At some point, the Mona Lisa {{was removed}} from its {{original}} frame. The unconstrained poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed {{near the top of}} the panel, extending down to the hairline of <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth.|$|E
25|$|Continuous phase {{transitions}}, such as order-disorder {{transitions in}} metallic alloys and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions, involve {{a transition from}} an ordered to a disordered state. In terms of correlation functions, the equal-time correlation function is non-zero for all lattice points below the critical temperature, and is non-negligible for only a fairly small radius above the critical temperature. As the phase transition is continuous, the length over which the microscopic variables are correlated, , must transition continuously from being infinite to finite when the material is heated through its critical temperature. This {{gives rise to a}} power-law dependence of the correlation function as a function of distance at the critical point. This is shown in <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left for the case of a ferromagnetic material, with the quantitative details listed in the section on magnetism.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{the cavity}} is {{held at a}} fixed {{temperature}} T and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at thermal equilibrium with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing {{in and out of}} the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate black-body radiation that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature T and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole. See <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Introduction for the spectrum as a function of the frequency of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation E=hf, with E = energy, h = Planck's constant, f = frequency.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drawing {{relates to}} a woman seated in the lower left {{foreground}} of the painting. Included in the study are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic. The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model. The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light bistre, and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink. Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground, in this case achieved by rubbing crushed red chalk onto the paper.|$|E
25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture), probably to wash the crushed ore from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E

500|$|The opening stanza, [...] "" [...] (Christ lay in death's bonds) {{is treated}} as a chorale fantasia. Without {{instrumental}} opening, the movement starts with the chorale tune sung by the soprano in very long notes, with all other parts entering soon after the soprano begins each choral statement. The alto line {{is derived from the}} chorale tune, while the viola parts principally reinforce the alto and tenor voices. The violin parts are independent and, as Traupman-Carr notes [...] "further activate the texture with a virtually continuous exchange of sixteenth-note snippets". <b>The</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> violins known as [...] (sigh) reflects [...] "Christ's suffering in the grip of death".|$|E
500|$|Jenny Uglow {{believes}} that the boy echoes <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last print of William Hogarth's The Four Stages of Cruelty by pointing out the arrogance and potential cruelty of experimentation, while David Fraser also sees the compositional similarities with the audience grouped round a central demonstration. The neutral stance of the central character and the uncertain intentions of the boy with the cage were both later ideas: an early study, discovered {{on the back of}} a self-portrait, omits the boy and shows the natural philosopher reassuring the girls. In this sketch it is obvious that the bird will survive, and thus the composition lacks the power of the final version.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Nibley of Brigham Young University {{notes that}} the {{seemingly}} misidentified characters in Facsimile No. 3 may have been participating in a ritual where {{both men and women}} can be represented by the opposite sex. Nibley also argues that Smith's interpretation of the facsimile avoids making [...] "romantic and quite unjustified conclusions" [...] (e.g. identifying the seated person as Pharaoh, identifying the two feminine figures as Pharaoh's wife and daughter, or as Abraham's wife Sarah); instead, Nibley contends that Smith's interpretation of the facsimile is consistent with modern understandings of [...] "the court scenes on other biographical or autobiographical records" [...] (for instance, that <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of a stele is usually the owner or [...] "usually some personal servant or palace officer attendant on Pharaoh", and that Smith indeed identified one of the central figure as a servant-cum-waiter named Shulem).|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} {{have often been}} compared to the seven pages of the Turin-Milan Hours illuminated manuscript attributed to the unidentified artist [...] "Hand G", generally {{thought to have been}} Jan van Eyck. The closeness is seen to lie both in the miniaturist technique and the particular painterly style. The similarity of a Turin drawing of the crucified Christ to <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New York diptych has led some art historians to conclude they were, at least, painted near the same time, during the 1420s and early 1430s. Most believe both the drawing and diptych panel at least originated from a prototype designed by Jan van Eyck. Panofsky attributed the New York panels to [...] "Hand G". When the Turin-Milan Hours miniatures were discovered they were at first believed to have been painted before the Duke of Berry's death in 1416, an idea that was quickly rejected with the date extended to sometime in the early 1430s.|$|E
