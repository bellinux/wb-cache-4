Norman Wilson remarks that the bodies are attributable to the Royce administration and Michael Steintorf, the new chief of staff, states that <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> {{of the story is}} that it draws attention away from the massive school deficit. Steintorf counsels that they should use this as cover to avoid dealing with the deficit as it would hamstring Carcetti's plans to run for governor and that Carcetti will have the funds to address the city's education problems when he becomes governor. Wilson is disappointed to see that Carcetti is willing to trade fulfilling his responsibilities as mayor with increasing his chances of becoming governor.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} '80s a {{decision}} was taken to stop bloodlines (no stabbing). <b>The</b> <b>silver</b> <b>line</b> complained that <b>the</b> gold line were now not doing their jobs. The gold <b>line</b> complained about <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>line</b> being greedy with the food. In {{the days when the}} bloodlines were still open the gold line members had a very strict diet to follow as they were not allowed to get fat. They were not allowed to eat eggs for example and were never allowed sugar with the coffee and their porridge. All these items went to <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>lines</b> instead. Upon <b>the</b> closing of the bloodlines the gold line demanded that they get the food they wanted since there was no longer a need to stay fit. <b>The</b> <b>silver</b> <b>line</b> refused, and thus the gold line declared war on <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|On December 13, 2009, <b>the</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line,</b> Metro's second Metro Transitway (bus rapid transit) line, began service {{between the}} Harbor Gateway Transit Center, Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station.

500|$|Janet Maslin, {{writing in}} The New York Times, thought Johnny Depp [...] "proved" [...] {{himself as an}} {{established}} [...] "certified great actor". [...] "Depp captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> of any cloud." [...] Todd McCarthy from Variety called Ed Wood [...] "a fanciful, sweet-tempered biopic about the man often described as the worst film director of all time. Always engaging to watch and often dazzling in its imagination and technique, picture is also a bit distended, and lacking in weight at its center. The result is beguiling rather than thrilling." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Stuart, from The Guardian, {{pointed out}} the {{contrast}} between Square Enix's policy and that of companies like Valve, which officially adopted the Half-Life fan mods Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat, and Vivendi Universal Games, which granted a licence to the King's Quest fan game <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Lining.</b> He noted that since Crimson Echoes was a ROM hack, {{it was in a}} [...] "trickier area of copy protection law" [...] than those other projects, but felt that its release would have had next to no commercial impact since the game was to be distributed as an IPS patch rather than a ROM image. Finally, he noted that an official port of the fangame to the Nintendo DS or WiiWare would have had more [...] "marketing benefits" [...] for Square Enix.|$|E
500|$|In July 1790 the Russian Baltic Fleet was {{defeated}} by the Swedish at the Battle of Svensksund. Despite the damage, <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> for the Russians was that the Swedes now felt able to negotiate on an even footing and a peace was soon signed, based on the status quo ante bellum, thus ending the threat of invasion. The peace also freed up military resources for {{the war against the}} Turks. Potemkin had moved his evermore lavish court to Bender and there were soon more successes against Turkey, including the capture of Batal-Pasha and, on the second attempt, of Kilia on the Danube. By the end of November, only one major target remained: the Turkish fortress of Izmail. At Potemkin's request, General Suvorov commanded the assault, which proved to be costly but effective. The victory was commemorated by Russia's first, albeit unofficial, national anthem, [...] "Let the thunder of victory sound!", written by Gavrila Derzhavin and Osip Kozlovsky.|$|E

2500|$|... 1983–84 was a trying {{season in}} the league, with Everton being in {{the bottom half of}} the First Division for much of the season and fans making {{continued}} calls for Howard Kendall to be sacked, but a good run of form in the final weeks of the season saw Everton achieve a seventh-place finish once again. Everton, however, were progressing on two cup fronts. Reaching their second League Cup final, now known as the Milk Cup, the Blues drew 0–0 with Liverpool at Wembley, but eventually lost the replay.

2500|$|In 1994, Depp {{reunited with}} {{director}} Tim Burton, playing {{the title role}} in Ed Wood, a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors.

[...] He found that the role gave him a [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun" [...] and that working with Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting".

2500|$|That {{company of}} Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was {{organized}} somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept {{of which was}} just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in 1594, after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: Philip Henslowe functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (<b>The</b> <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. (Francis Langley, builder of the Swan Theatre, operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.) ...|$|E

50|$|Usage of {{the lanes}} and bus {{services}} has been low, but <b>the</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> has helped raise ridership on the Harbor Transitway. <b>The</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> began service on December 13, 2009. Ridership {{is lower than}} the El Monte Busway, which is also served by <b>the</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> A number of reasons have been identified: The main causes for the low ridership are the premium express fare charged to passengers compared to riders on the Blue Line and Metro Rapid (up to $1 more each way than a trip made on the Rapid or Blue Line), the isolated and noisy freeway environment of the stations, and the inconvenience of accessing the stations (and lack of surrounding buses) around the stations compared to surface level light rail or Rapid service. Ridership began increasing with the advent of <b>the</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> In late June 2011, Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> service frequency increased from 30 mins to 15 mins on Weekdays and on Saturdays, service increased from 60 mins to 40 mins. In the February 2012 Metro Express Lanes Program report, ridership on <b>the</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> alone on <b>the</b> Harbor Transitway was 3,969. The report revealed that ridership on <b>the</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> alone increased 43% from the June 2011 improved frequency of <b>the</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> On June 17, 2012 Metro added the second phase of adding more service to <b>the</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> Weekday peak hour service was added for <b>the</b> Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> (an improvement from 10 mins to 4-8 mins). Saturday, Sunday/Holiday service was added for <b>the</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> (an improvement from 40 mins to 20 mins on Saturdays and from 60 mins to 30 mins on Sundays/Holidays).|$|R
2500|$|The band's seventh album, Let Your Dim Light Shine (1995), {{peaked at}} number {{six in the}} US and in Canada. It was {{certified}} double-platinum in Canada and platinum in the US.

2500|$|The story follows Sakura, a 14-year-old princess who'd rather marry {{for love}} and make her own choices in life than be married away to someone she's never met. Her best friend is Asagiri, a cute female Mononoke (a tiny spirit) who she once saved from a life of slavery (unbeknownst to her, Asagiri is really a Yuki-Onna). Since birth, she's been engaged to Prince Oura. Not wanting to marry the prince after a {{precarious}} argument with Prince Oura's messenger, named Aoba, Sakura runs away but gets lost and accidentally looks at the full moon, which she was warned to never do. A man-eating demon arrives, referring to Sakura as [...] "Princess Kaguya" [...] and nearly wounds her, but Aoba and a priestess that Sakura knows named Byakuya arrive. Priestess Byakuya tells Sakura that she is in fact Princess Kaguya's granddaughter {{and is the only}} one able to destroy the demons. By drawing a pair of back-to-back crescent moons on her palm, she is able to summon the mystic sword Chizakura and kill the demon. She also discovers the word “destroy” is actually her Soul Symbol (a symbol each person possesses that best represents his or her true nature). Soon after, Sakura, Asagiri, and Aoba travel to Prince Oura's estate, where it's discovered that Aoba actually is Prince Oura, explaining {{that he wanted to be}} mischievous. Of course, the two don't get along from then on, until finally while relaxing under a tree, the two finally seem to come to an understanding, and do appear to be finding <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> in their arranged engagement. Unfortunately, she is soon under threat of execution, as Aoba turns on her, as he's afraid that she will eventually become a demon herself, like her mother and grandmother before her. Aoba shoots an arrow through her chest and Sakura falls into a river, only to be found by a cute and sassy young ninja named Kohaku and her childhood friend Hayate, who used to be human but was accidentally turned into a frog by Kohaku (although he regains his human form during the full moon). While with Kohaku, the two form a nice friendship, and Sakura reveals that she is being hunted by Kohaku's master, who just so happens to be Aoba. Kohaku though in return admits already knowing this, and tells that she doesn't wish to harm her, and wants to protect her. The two, along with Asagiri and Hayate, soon encounter Aoba and his men, and Volume 1 ends with Sakura being affected by a youko whistle that Aoba has.|$|E
