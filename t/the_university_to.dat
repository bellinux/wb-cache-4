5|$|After {{a lengthy}} battle between {{supporters}} of the University of Houston, led by school president A.D. Bruce, and forces from state universities geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> enter the state system in 1963.|$|E

5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut when he left <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed {{he and his wife}} received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E

5|$|All this time, Bradbury {{remained}} nominally {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>to</b> terminate the contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> Hamilton was first {{brought up by}} a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by {{the university}} until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated {{the future of the}} university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5|$|By late 1975, {{after seven}} years at the helm, Charles Perry felt he had {{accomplished}} his goal and left <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> become {{president and publisher of}} the Sunday newspaper magazine Family Weekly (now USA Weekend), one of the country's largest magazines. When he left, there were more than 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 regular season where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two African-American members of the team {{would not be allowed to}} play because of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50years later.|$|E
5|$|Female {{students}} were {{admitted to the}} college {{for the first time}} in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain on college numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was unable to provide accommodation for all of its fresher students {{for the first time in}} its history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate numbers have been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E
5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> reinstate his original salary.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the McGill University Health Centre, McGill has been directly partnered with many teaching hospitals for decades, and also {{has a history of}} collaborating with many hospitals in Montreal. These cooperations allow <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> graduate over 1,000 students in health care each year. McGill's contract-affiliated teaching hospitals include the Montreal Children's Hospital, the Montreal General Hospital, the Montreal Neurological Hospital, the Montreal Chest Institute and the Royal Victoria Hospital which are all now part of the McGill University Health Centre. Other hospitals that health care students may use include the Jewish General Hospital, the Douglas Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital Center.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky's {{football}} program was overshadowed by its successful basketball program during Collier's tenure. Collier was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills, a crucial factor for college coaches. Many fans wrote <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> complain {{about him and}} his staff. Still, several future star coaches served as assistants under Collier at Kentucky, including Don Shula, Chuck Knox, Howard Schnellenberger and Bill Arnsparger. Standout players under Collier included All-Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{week after}} the season's conclusion, backup quarterback Tyler Ferguson {{announced}} his plans to transfer from <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>to</b> somewhere he would have an opportunity to start, rather than be Christian Hackenberg's backup for the remainder of his career. Later, it was announced that though he originally intended to transfer to Western Kentucky (WKU), at which Bobby Petrino was head coach; when Petrino accepted the head coaching position at Louisville, Ferguson changed his plans, and transferred there. In early December, it was reported that quarterbacks coach Charlie Fisher and linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden, the latter of whom was a holdover from the Joe Paterno era, departed, with speculation that they were forced out by Bill O'Brien.|$|E

5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} school teachers begin their teacher education at the University of Malta by gaining a Bachelor of Education (Honours), which typically takes four years of study to achieve.

University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a postgraduate certificate in education.

The Minister for Education may also grant a temporary warrant to teach, valid for one year, to any person the Minister believes has the ability to teach in the country.|$|E
