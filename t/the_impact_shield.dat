The probehead was designed for a 17. 6 Tesla (750 MHz) wide-bore magnet, and operates within a 40 mm inner diameter gradient set with maximum strength 1 Tesla per metre. We performed simulations to estimate <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of <b>shielding</b> between <b>the</b> coils on the B 1 field distribution. Results showed that for coil-shield separations on the order of a coil radius, no significant change in B 1 homogeneity is expected, and therefore coils were spaced accordingly. Coil isolation of greater than 35 dB was achieved for all coils, and the Q values were 160 unloaded and 60 loaded with 100 mM NaCl solution. Practical use of the probehead was demonstrated by obtaining simultaneously four three-dimensional T 1 maps of chemically fixed Xenopus laevis oocytes at a spatial resolution of 30 60 60 m. The T 1 values for the nucleus were 2. 7 seconds, an...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives {{a summary}} of <b>the</b> {{findings}} from <b>impacts</b> on <b>shielded</b> gas-filled cylindrical aluminium alloy (Al 2219 T 851) and titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) pressure vessels that were performed at the Ernst-Mach-Institute {{in the frame of}} an ESA contract [1]. <b>The</b> effect of <b>impacts</b> on <b>shielded</b> vessels with projectiles that have a kinetic energy close to the ballistic limit of the combined system of shield and vessel's front wall was investigated. The shields were single Al-bumper plates, unreinforced MLI and MLI reinforced with 2 layers of Betacloth. The threshold diameters that cause leakage from the vessel's front wall were determined experimentally as a function of shield material and shield spacing. For Al-shielded Al- and Ti-vessels, a safety design factor to avoid leakage is presented based on existing Whipple shield equations...|$|R
40|$|A {{hypervelocity}} <b>impact</b> <b>shield</b> {{and method}} for protecting a wall structure, {{such as a}} spacecraft wall, from impact with particles of debris having densities of about 2. 7 g/cu cm and impact velocities up to 16 km/s are disclosed. The shield comprises a stack of ultra thin sheets of impactor disrupting material supported and arranged by support means in spaced relationship {{to one another and}} mounted to cover the wall in a position for intercepting the particles. The sheets are of a number and spacing such that <b>the</b> <b>impacting</b> particle and <b>the</b> resulting particulates of <b>the</b> <b>impacting</b> particle and sheet material are successively impact-shocked to a thermal state of total melt and/or vaporization to a degree as precludes perforation of the wall. The ratio of individual sheet thickness to the theoretical diameter of particles of debris which may be of spherical form is in the range of 0. 03 to 0. 05. The spacing between adjacent sheets is such that the debris cloud plume of liquid and vapor resulting from an impacting particle penetrating a sheet does not puncture the next adjacent sheet prior to the arrival thereat of fragment particulates of sheet material and the debris particle produced by a previous impact...|$|R
2500|$|On March 28, 2014, the NHTSA {{announced}} that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S design was making the electric car prone to catch fire, after the automaker said it would provide more protection to its lithium-ion batteries. According to the NHTSA, the titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, reduce the severity, frequency, and fire risk of underbody strikes. All Model S cars manufactured after March 6 have the [...] aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield {{designed to protect the}} battery and charging circuitry from being punctured even in very high speed <b>impacts.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>shielding</b> features a hollow aluminum tube to deflect impacting objects, a titanium shield to protect sensitive components from puncture damage, and an aluminum extrusion to absorb <b>impact</b> energy. <b>The</b> new <b>shields,</b> which decrease vehicle range by 0.1%, will be installed free-of-charge in existing Model S vehicles by request or during the next scheduled maintenance. According to the NHTSA, the titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, [...] "should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk." ...|$|R
