25|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> put renewed development {{pressure on the}} mountain, especially as its owners dynamited areas to create steeper trails. A proposal to amend the state constitution and trade land closer to the summit ridge to <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> for holdings elsewhere was vigorously opposed by environmentalists and failed to pass the legislature in the early 1990s. Governor George Pataki's 1999 designation of most Catskill High Peaks as a state Bird Conservation Area, to protect Bicknell's thrush and other threatened montane bird species, finally put the idea to rest.|$|E

25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, {{wanted to do something}} with <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas at the time and opened a -long alpine slide down very steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).|$|E

25|$|GAR, as {{its legal}} {{troubles}} would suggest, {{was accused of}} cutting corners to maximize its profits.

These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety (in the park's last year, it kept part of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> open despite being unable to obtain liability insurance).|$|E

40|$|Ruapehu is {{an active}} volcano located on the North Island of New Zealand, with the most recent major eruptions {{occurring}} in 1945, 1969, 1975, and 1995 / 96. Ruapehu {{is also home to}} the three major North Island <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> Whakapapa, Turoa, and Tukino. Because of the high frequency of eruptions, there is a significant volcanic hazard at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> particularly from lahars which can form even after minor eruptions. Most recently, lahars have affected Whakapapa <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> in 1969, 1975, and 1995 / 96. The most significant risk at Turoa is from ballistic bombs due to the proximity of the top two T-Bars to the crater. Ash fall has also caused disruption at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> covering <b>the</b> snow and causing damage to structures. There is yet to be a death at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> from a volcanic event; however the risk at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> is too high to be completely ignored. <b>The</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> at Whakapapa and Turoa are currently operated by Ruapehu Alpine Lifts (RAL), who have been significantly improving their commitment to providing volcanic hazard training for their staff and preparing for handling a volcanic eruption. RAL is joined by the Institute of Geological Sciences (GNS) and the Department of Conservation (DoC) in trying to mitigate this risk through a range of initiatives, including an automated Eruption Detection System (EDS), linked to sirens and loudspeakers on Whakapapa <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as by providing staff training and public education. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide RAL with recommendations to improve their staff training and warning system response. Staff induction week at both Turoa and Whakapapa <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> was observed. Surveys were distributed and collected from staff at both <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> and interviews were conducted with staff at Whakapapa <b>ski</b> <b>area.</b> Data obtained from staff interviews and surveys provided the author with insight into staff's mental models regarding a volcanic event response. A simulation of the warning system was observed, as well as a blind test, to collect data on the effectiveness of training on staff response. Results indicated permanent and seasonal staff were knowledgeable of the volcanic hazards that may affect <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> but had differing perspectives on the risk associated with those hazards. They were found to be confident in the initial response to a volcanic event (i. e. move to higher ground), but were unsure of what would happen after this initial response. RAL was also found to have greatly improved their volcanic hazard training in the past year, however further recommendations were suggested to increase training effectiveness. A training needs analysis was done for different departments at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> by taking a new approach of anticipating demands staff may encounter during a volcanic event and complementing these demands with existing staff competencies. Additional recommendations were made to assist RAL in developing an effective plan to use when responding to volcanic events, as well as other changes that could be made to improve the likelihood of customer safety at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> during an eruption...|$|R
