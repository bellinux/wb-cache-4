5|$|Article 33 of the BSAC {{charter of}} 1889 gave the British {{government}} the right <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> or repeal {{any of the}} administrative provisions of the charter after 25 years.

5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea fish are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
