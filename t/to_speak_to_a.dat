5|$|In 1927, Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, {{the leader}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association of Haifa, a {{prominent}} merchant, and future associate of Darwaza, invited him to his home <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large group of students and notables about nationalist (qawmiyya) and patriotic (wataniyya) education. This was recognition that Darwaza's contribution to the spread of Arab nationalist sentiments gained influence not only in an-Najah School, but throughout Palestine.|$|E

As MalcolmX and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot Malcolm in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun. Two other men charged the stage and fired handguns, hitting MalcolmX 16 times.|$|E
5|$|Black {{tracks the}} history of the second kidnapper, finding that he was {{involved}} in a military medical group; Swan's name is also associated with this group. As Black is investigating, Watts approaches him, showing him a second photograph of Taylor, now looking sickly, beside the canister. Watts believes she has less than two days to live. Meanwhile, Hollis has discovered that Swan frequently called Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM radio show under a pseudonym to discuss conspiracy theories about Gulf War syndrome. Bell invites Black onto the show <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> listening Swan; the two realise that Black's wife was killed by a pathogen Swan was ordered to test on his troops during the Gulf War—an order which came from a group outside of the Army.|$|E

5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prostitute whom he sees across {{the room with a}} prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E
5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise, {{under the}} command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, they find that Jameson is becoming stronger and more able to move about on his own, and is no longer showing signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to have before he was beamed aboard. The crew discovers that Jameson has been taking an array of drugs to reverse the aging process over the last two years, and only recently has taken an overdose of the drugs to prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E

Allegations against the hospital were directed at the examining nurse who allegedly fabricated statements concerning the initial medical examination, her supervisor (who adopted those statements {{even though they were}} contrary to the examination), and the failure of the Hospital to supervise these employees.|$|E

25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E
25|$|Three months later, Tony {{returns to}} Miami. All of his assets have been frozen, and {{the districts of}} Miami he used to {{dominate}} have been divided among other drug cartels. His first act is to ask George Sheffield (James Woods) to become his lawyer again. Sheffield reluctantly agrees, but at higher wages than before. As Tony has no real power anymore, he has little choice. He next travels to see his old friend and contact Felix (Carlos Ferro), who tells him Sosa is working with Gaspar Gomez (Cheech Marin) {{in an effort to}} take over all of Tony's old turf. He also warns Tony there are very few dealers who can be trusted anymore, as most report back to Sosa. Tony says he needs to make some small deals so he can make enough money to buy his mansion back from the Vice Squad, and begin to rebuild his empire. Felix advises him <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bartender named Coco (Willa Holland). She puts him in touch with some dealers, as he slowly begins to re-establish his name, earning enough to re-purchase his mansion. He calls Felix, who tells him that he thinks Gaspar is smuggling cash. Tony steals one of Gaspar's trucks, carrying $50,000, and uses it to open a bank account. Reconnecting with his old banker, Jerry (Michael York), Montana uses the bank to launder his money as he sets out to reclaim control of Little Havana from the Diaz Brothers. As Tony's reputation increases, the brothers attempt to have him killed. He survives the assassination attempt, and one of the killers tells him the Diazes have murdered his mother. Killing them both in retaliation, he regains control of Little Havana.|$|E

500|$|Members of the London Labour groups chastised Livingstone for his {{controversial}} statements, believing them {{detrimental to the}} party, leading Labour members and supporters to defect to the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Many highlighted Labour's failure to secure the seat in the Croydon North West by-election, 1981 {{as a sign of}} Labour's prospects under Livingstone. Some called for Livingstone's removal, but Michael Foot's Trotskyist assistant Una Cooze defended Livingstone's position to her boss. Television and radio outlets welcomed Livingstone on for interviews; described by biographer John Carvel as having [...] "one of the best television styles of any contemporary politician", Livingstone used this medium <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wider audience, gaining widespread public support, something Carvell attributed to his [...] "directness, self-deprecation, colourful language, complete unflappability under fire and lack of pomposity", coupled with popular policies like Fares Fair.|$|E
500|$|This {{development}} had {{a ripple}} effect throughout both regions and in the Paris markets. Both Champagne and Burgundy were deeply concerned with the [...] "healthiness" [...] reputation of their wines, even {{to the extent of}} paying medical students to write theses touting the health benefit of their wines. These theses were then used as advertising pamphlets that were sent to merchants and customers. The Faculty of Medicine in Reims published several papers to refute Fagon's claim that Burgundy wine was healthier than Champagne. In response, Burgundian winemakers hired physician Jean-Baptiste de Salins, dean of the medical school in Beaune, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> packed auditorium at the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Salins spoke favorably of Burgundy wine's deep color and robust nature and compared it to the pale red color of Champagne and the [...] "instability" [...] of the wine to travel long distances and the flaws of the bubbles from when secondary fermentation would take place. The text of his speech was published in newspapers and pamphlets throughout France and had a damaging effect on Champagne sales.|$|E
500|$|Hannah {{eventually}} {{began dating}} Simon, whom she {{met at a}} glazier where they both work. Despite their rules, Hannah sleeps with Simon and becomes pregnant, which upsets Eve, who makes {{an effort to get}} pregnant but is unable to do so; Hannah miscarries in the eighth month, much to Eve's relief. Years later, Simon meets Eve in a bar. The two begin an affair, and Eve becomes pregnant; by this time, Hannah is infertile. On their birthday, Simon gives a handmade mirror to Hannah, but they have an argument, and Hannah reveals that she has a sister who is pregnant; Simon realises he is the father. The following day, Hannah has an argument with Eve over the matter and the latter flees to Glasgow. Hannah, wearing Eve's wig, confronts Simon. Unaware that she is Hannah, Simon gifts her another mirror, stating his desire to be with Eve instead of Hannah. Hannah becomes furious, shattering the mirror and slicing Simon's throat with a piece of it, killing him, though this is said to be accidental. When Eve returns, the two agree to hide Simon's body, and use Eve's trip to Glasgow as an alibi. At the end of the interview, Eve says that Hannah is [...] "gone", asks <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lawyer, and cryptically says that [...] "...all these stories we’ve been telling each other… just that… stories." [...] It is not entirely clear if Eve's story of being an identical twin is true, an intentional fabrication meant to confuse the police, or a case of split personality.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} 10 years, Truth spoke before dozens, perhaps hundreds, of audiences.

In 1853, she spoke at a suffragist [...] "mob convention" [...] at the Broadway Tabernacle in New York City; that year she also met Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1856, she traveled to Battle Creek, Michigan, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> group called the [...] "Friends of Human Progress."

2500|$|Soon {{after this}} {{there was a}} rather strange {{series of events that}} led to the {{deportation}} of Bishop Colin Winter. David de Beer, the diocesan treasurer, was asked <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> student group at the University of the Witwatersrand (his alma mater) on Namibia. Among other things he spoke about the contract labour system, saying that it was a form of slavery, and mentioned an incident in which the supervisor of a group of contact workers had threatened them with immediate dismissal if they bought Bibles, {{on the grounds that they}} were [...] "communist Bibles". So the employers controlled the workers' leisure time, and told them what they could or could not read.|$|E
2500|$|Both Thompson and Colburn {{were interviewed}} {{for the film}} Four Hours in My Lai (1989) (Remember My Lai? on PBS) - which {{went on to win}} a British Academy Award and an {{international}} Emmy award. The interview showed Thompson relating what he had witnessed at My Lai: [...] "Here {{we were supposed to be}} the guys in the white hats. It upset me". Bilton and his colleague Kevin Sim then began researching a book and Bilton conducted further interviews with Thompson and Colburn. When the book Four Hours in My Lai (1992) was published, it prompted a campaign to have the heroism of Thompson and his helicopter crew recognised. Several senior figures in the U.S. military supported the campaign, as did President George H. W. Bush. Thompson and Colburn were invited <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide range of audiences about the ethics of warfare including at West Point, a conference in Norway, and at Connecticut College in New London, where they were each awarded an honorary doctorate.|$|E
