5|$|The most {{significant}} {{findings from the}} ice survey were a positive reading from the metal detector, coupled with a significant echo from the Ground Penetrating Radar, both from the small area where <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> assumed to have sunk.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins {{assert that}} Earp carried the pistol {{featured}} in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder have been replaced. Only <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> original, and its serial number has been filed off. However, X-ray testing showed an original serial number, 5686, which matches a batch of revolvers purchased by the U.S. Army in 1874.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> {{a diamond}} design with a {{reinforced}} single front down tube bolting to the engine's crankcase. The top of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> a reinforced double-tube over and under configuration meeting a multi-tube box under the rider.|$|R
50|$|In a {{strip of}} movie film, {{individual}} <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> separated by <b>frame</b> lines. Normally, 24 <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> needed for one second of film. In ordinary filming, <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> photographed automatically, one after the other, in a movie camera. In special effects or animation filming, <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> often shot one at a time.|$|R
25|$|Although the axes of <b>the</b> unprimed <b>frame</b> <b>are</b> {{orthogonal}} and <b>the</b> axes of <b>the</b> primed <b>frame</b> <b>are</b> inclined, <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> actually equivalent. <b>The</b> asymmetry {{is due to}} unavoidable mapping distortions, {{and should}} be considered no stranger than the mapping distortions that occur, say, when mapping a spherical Earth onto a flat map.|$|R
5|$|The {{objects to}} be {{transformed}} may be something else than ordinary physical objects extending in three spatial dimensions (and time, unless <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> the rest frame). It is for these objects that representation theory is needed for the mathematical description of transformations induced by ordinary Lorentz transformations of spacetime. For instance, the electromagnetic field is often (naively) envisaged by the assignment to each point in spacetime of a three-dimensional vector representing the electric field and another three-dimensional vector representing the magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> projected.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> {{changed to}} allow half-{{elliptic}} springs to be fitted {{in place of}} the old three-quarter elliptic springs. The back end of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> given a deeper channel section, it now sweeps up over the rear axle. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> also receives bracing from the running board brackets and cross hangers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{throstle}} <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> {{a descendant}} of <b>the</b> water <b>frame.</b> It used <b>the</b> same principles, was better engineered and driven by steam. In 1828 <b>the</b> Danforth throstle <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> invented in <b>the</b> United States. The heavy flyer caused the spindle to vibrate, and the yarn snarled every time <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> stopped. Not a success.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> total <b>frame</b> height <b>is</b> 115 cm, and {{the iron}} bars which form <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>are</b> {{approximately}} 4 cm wide and 1.5 cm thick.|$|R
25|$|In {{the above}} lines of text, when the orange circle is shown, all {{the text in}} <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> {{rendered}} using ClearType (RGB subpixel rendering); when the orange circle is absent all the text is rendered using normal (full pixel greyscale) anti-aliasing.|$|E
25|$|Collected trot: A very engaged trot {{where most}} of the horse's weight is carried toward the hindquarters. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> {{compressed}} and the stride length is shorter {{than any of the other}} trots with the horse taking higher steps. The horse is lighter and more mobile in the collected trot.|$|E
25|$|The banjo is a four-, five- or six-stringed {{instrument}} {{with a thin}} membrane {{stretched over}} a frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head. The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> typically circular. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{construction}} {{consists of}} a platform or netting mounted on two long poles, lashed {{in the shape of}} an elongated isosceles triangle; <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> dragged with <b>the</b> sharply pointed end forward. Sometimes the blunt end of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> stabilized by a third pole bound across the two poles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> main PROP-M <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> a squat {{box with}} a small {{protrusion}} at <b>the</b> center. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> supported on two wide flat skis, one extending down from each side elevating <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> slightly above <b>the</b> surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The general {{situation}} and the future development of ballast cleaner are summarized. The principleand structureof RM 80 ballast cleaner is introduced. The three-dimensional model of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> has <b>been</b> established. By finite element analysis software the structural changes of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> has <b>been</b> analyzed. <b>The</b> weak links of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>are</b> identified and <b>the</b> improvement methods are put forward...|$|R
25|$|A low {{aluminium}} {{glass mirror}} is manufactured by coating silver and {{two layers of}} protective paint on the back surface of glass. A low aluminium glass mirror is very clear, light transmissive, smooth, and reflects accurate natural colors. This type of glass is widely used for framing presentations and exhibitions in which a precise color representation of the artwork is truly essential or when the background color of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> predominantly white.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> {{a single}} tube {{following}} {{the circumference of}} the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any trail. A spoon brake is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever {{from one of the}} handlebars. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the headset. The saddle mounts on the frame less than 50cm (18in) behind the headset.|$|E
25|$|Spare:A spare is scored {{when all}} pins are felled {{by the first}} one or two balls. In such a case <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> reset and the player {{continues}} until all three balls have been rolled. The maximum score in a 9-pin frame is therefore 27, although this is extremely rare if not unheard of. On some alleys a 12-spare is not uncommon. Once the front has been felled the front pin of the reset frame {{does not need to}} be hit again.|$|E

25|$|Touring {{models are}} {{distinguishable}} by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over air suspension {{and are the}} only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> distinguished by {{the location of the}} steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.|$|E
25|$|Like {{some other}} {{transforms}}, wavelet transforms {{can be used}} to transform data, then encode the transformed data, resulting in effective compression. For example, JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard that uses biorthogonal wavelets. This means that although <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> overcomplete, it is a tight frame (see types of frames of a vector space), and the same frame functions (except for conjugation in the case of complex wavelets) are used for both analysis and synthesis, i.e., in both the forward and inverse transform. For details see wavelet compression.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{cylinders}} in {{these types of}} revolvers are firmly attached at {{the front and rear}} of the frame, and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> typically full thickness all the way around, fixed cylinder revolvers are inherently strong designs. Accordingly, many modern large caliber hunting revolvers tend {{to be based on the}} fixed cylinder design. Fixed cylinder revolvers can fire the strongest and most powerful cartridges, but at the price of being the slowest to load and reload and they cannot use speedloaders or moon clips for loading, as only one chamber is exposed at a time to the loading gate.|$|E
50|$|The base of <b>the</b> goal <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> now {{shallower}} and narrower by 4 inches. The {{overall width}} of the base of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 96 to 88 inches {{and the depth of}} the base of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 44 to 40 inches. Additionally, the corners where the goal post meets the crossbar were bent with a smaller radius, allowing more area across the goal plane. The size of the goal itself remains 6 feet wide and 4 feet tall.|$|R
3000|$|At <b>the</b> encoder, <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> {{separated}} into two sets.

25|$|Smart's unsentimental {{paintings}} encompass lonely urban vistas {{that seem}} both disturbing and threatening. Isolated individuals seem lost in industrial wastelands, full of high rise construction, concrete street-scapes and an eerie feeling of harmony and equilibrium – where silence and stillness create a deathly ambience. 'The express rape of the landscape' is one title hanging over Smart's paintings, {{referring to the}} freeways, street signs, trucks, oil drums, containers, buildings and concrete dividers that are the ever-present subjects of his work. At the same time his paintings – full of bold colours and perfect symmetry – are beautiful. The repetition of road signs in his works, for example, suggest an inconclusive direction and a world outside <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> tantalising suggested.|$|E
25|$|Also {{completed}} in 1966 was the Mining and Minerals Engineering and Physical Metallurgy Departments, {{which was designed}} by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates. This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than ten feet away. The building received the 1966 RIBA Architecture Award for the West Midlands. It was statutorily listed in 1993. Taking the full five years from 1962 to 1967, Birmingham erected twelve buildings which each cost in excess of {{a quarter of a}} million pounds.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{animation}} {{was added}} to the GIF89a spec via the Graphics Control Extension (GCE), which allows various images (frames) in the file to be painted with time delays, forming a video clip. An animated GIF file comprises a number of frames that are displayed in succession, each introduced by its own GCE, which gives the time delay to wait after <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> drawn. Global information {{at the start of the}} file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file-offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> totally redesigned, with engine {{mounting}} and steering geometry changes.|$|R
30|$|Complexity {{reduction}} is initially obtained with temporal downsampling, since only <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> conventionally encoded. However, if <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> to be encoded as I-frames, {{a more significant}} complexity reduction can be achieved, since {{there will be no}} motion estimation at the encoder side. Note that if <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> selected as <b>the</b> reference <b>frames</b> and <b>the</b> WZ <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> nonreference <b>frames,</b> then <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> can <b>be</b> coded as conventional I-, P-, or reference B-frames, without drifting errors. This not only increases the performance in terms of RD, but also increases the complexity since motion estimation may be used for <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> as well.|$|R
