40|$|Because Louisiana {{is facing}} {{financial}} difficulties, {{the impact of}} reductions in federal aid since 1980 has been severe. With a state economy dependent on gas, oil, and agriculture, Louisiana suffers when oil prices are low and farming costs are high. Reduced tax income for the state lowers state spending, forcing additional enterprises out of business. Louisiana is left with a shrinking tax base {{at a time when}} state and local support for education must be increased. The major source of income for local schools is the property tax. Homestead exemption regulations shift the burden of taxation onto businesses and commercial property. Shrinkage of the local tax base results in disproportionate school funding. Small financial disparities between districts can result in large educational disparities for students. Efforts at educational reform require additional money and can lead to further regressivity of the taxing system. Just as school financial situations are best understood in terms of the local context, proposals for alternative, equitable financing must be based on local variables. A <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources for selected Louisiana districts is provided and three pages of references are included.

40|$|Despite {{the monthly}} {{year-on-year}} drop in gaming revenues for 18 consecutive months, casino operators in Macau keep opening new properties and adding more inventory to already excess supply <b>of</b> <b>tables.</b> Yet, a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} drivers <b>of</b> <b>table</b> game <b>revenues</b> eludes many casino operators. Gaming tables account for around 90 percent <b>of</b> all gaming <b>revenues</b> in Macau, while slots, which generate most <b>of</b> the <b>revenues</b> in markets such as the U. S., generate only around five percent <b>of</b> total gaming <b>revenues.</b> It is therefore imperative that casino operators have a holistic understanding of the determinants <b>of</b> <b>table</b> game <b>revenues.</b> This presentation develops a comprehensive model {{of the factors that}} influence table game revenues on the main gaming floor in Macau casinos and the interrelationships across these factors. Some of the factors discussed in the presentation include table minimum, main gaming floor customer service, main gaming floor physical environment, player reinvestment rates, and number of hands dealt per hour. Ways in which each of these factors can be measured are also suggested. This model will assist casino operators in making their table games operations more synergistic and more profitable...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent times}} utility {{companies}} have to orient to effective business due to hard market conditions. Thus, companies want to diminish business expenses and increase the revenues. Effective revenue capture is, after all, the aim <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance. Actually the revenue capture is usually not perfect and without losses. A part <b>of</b> <b>revenues</b> are always lost on the way from a service to payment, which is called revenue leakage and causes a financial loss. The revenue leakage is above all the result of bad infrastructure management, ineffective human and IT processes, ineffective billing and debt collection, frauds etc. The base <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> correction is unified understanding {{of the problem and}} standardization <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance, which could be achieved by determination <b>of</b> responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance and aspects <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> leakage. It is important to determine the objectives and aims of leakage correction. Understanding of problem reflects in the revenue assurance maturity. The thesis explains the revenue leakage and determines the areas <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance in utility companies as well as the relations among them. Varieties <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> leakages are determined and it is explained why and where they occur; thus solutions of problems are presented. The proposals for leakage corrections and problems which should be considered at leakage correction are presented as well. Main tasks that should be undertaken to achieve the core aims <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance are presented too. The point of view <b>of</b> eligibility <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance and leakage correction is emphasized. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} international {{experience with the}} assignments <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources to different levels of government, the public finance literature still lacks a general theory <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments. Two sets of arguments have been separately developed in the literature to explain and guide the practice <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments. The first is based on Musgrave and Oates’ tradition, and emphasizes the benefit principle and other means for increasing accountability and efficiency in the allocation of public expenditures. The second is based on optimal taxation principles, which emphasizes the marginal cost of public funds and the correct mix <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> instruments. The two approaches provide important insights to the problem, but they remain practically unconnected. This paper develops a theory <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments that integrates the two approaches. We discuss the validity and scope <b>of</b> currently applied <b>revenue</b> assignment rules, and provide practical recommendations to implement an optimal assignment <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources...|$|R
