5|$|But at {{that same}} moment <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> came into my mind. Don't let me find him! If only I could {{get rid of this}} dead weight, so that I could use all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use a}} subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> in his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the change to}} {{one-step}} procedures, reconstructiong opening and closing phases at the same time.

25|$|At {{this moment}} I {{have to tell}} Germany, I have {{to report to the}} Fuehrer in particular, that the {{thoughts}} of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Fuehrer and his faithful people were thinking of me. <b>This</b> <b>thought</b> gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colors.|$|E
25|$|In 1848 Young left Tennants', and in {{partnership}} with his friend and assistant Edward Meldrum, set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the sandstone roof of the coal mine, theorised that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> {{that it might be}} produced artificially.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>thought</b> {{experiment}} has two purposes. First, it {{is intended}} to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since {{there is a difference between}} a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.|$|E

25|$|Nietzsche {{may have}} {{encountered}} {{the idea of}} the Eternal Recurrence in the works of Heinrich Heine, who speculated that one day a person would be born with the same thought-processes as himself, and that the same applied to every other individual. Nietzsche expanded on <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory. Schopenhauer postulated that a person who unconditionally affirms life would do so even if everything that has happened were to happen again repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|In <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> {{experiment}} the telescopes {{are always}} present, but the experiment {{can start with}} the detection screen being present but then being removed just after the photon leaves the double-slit diaphragm, or the experiment can start with the detection screen being absent and then being inserted just after the photon leaves the diaphragm. Some theorists aver that inserting or removing the screen {{in the midst of}} the experiment can force a photon to retroactively decide to go through the double-slits as a particle when it had previously transited it as a wave, or vice versa. Wheeler does not accept this interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Dirac's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the Poisson brackets {{that occur in the}} classical dynamics of particle motion. From <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to a more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field. Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the quantisation rules in a novel and more illuminating manner. For this work, published in 1926, Dirac received a PhD from Cambridge. This formed the basis for Fermi-Dirac statistics that applies to systems consisting of many identical spin 1/2 particles (i.e. that obey the Pauli exclusion principle), e.g. electrons in solids and liquids, and importantly to the field of conduction in semi-conductors.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
500|$|In {{philosophy}} of mathematics, {{he and his}} mentor W. V. Quine developed the [...] "Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis", an argument for the reality of mathematical entities, later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but [...] "quasi-empirical". In the field of epistemology, he {{is known for his}} critique of the well known [...] "brain in a vat" [...] thought experiment. <b>This</b> <b>thought</b> experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.|$|E
500|$|The still-incomplete [...] was {{considered}} for a conversion to be the Navy's first guided-missile cruiser; <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> lasted until 26 February 1952, when a different conversion to a [...] "large command ship" [...] was contemplated. In anticipation of the conversion, her classification was changed to CBC-1. This would have made her a [...] "larger sister" [...] to , but {{a year and a}} half later (9 October 1954) she was re-designated CB-3. Hawaii was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and was sold for scrap in 1959.|$|E

500|$|During the lyrics, Stan sings, [...] "You make me this, {{bring me}} up, bring me down, plays it sweet/Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat", which Baines wrote was Stan's [...] "vision {{of the perfect}} man". He also wrote, [...] "The second verse informs us that he's a 'sexy boy' who can set Stan 'free,' but that he's just as 'shy' as he is 'dirty.' Mr. Saxobeat, so it would seem, {{contains}} multitudes." [...] Echoing <b>this</b> <b>thought,</b> Stan stated that [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] was only her vision of the perfect man when on German television ARD.|$|E
500|$|When Cunningham {{first heard}} the track, he wrote down the words [...] "milk", [...] "sexual", [...] "surgery", and [...] "white porcelain"; they outline {{what would become the}} music video. Concerning this, Cunningham added that it was like Karma Sutra meeting Industrial Robotics and that because of the surreal nature of the images, they could be [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] as they liked. [...] Initially, it was planned that during the visual's ending, the robots would unfold like a flower as they mated, {{revealing}} an abstract life form made from the two artificial forms.

500|$|Interviewed by Jacob Fortin on {{guilt about}} being a skeptic on a show that Richard Dawkins campaigned against, Davis replied that at first he had some {{trepidation}} until realizing that Dawkins [...] "had no evidence whatsoever and presented none" [...] that the show encouraged people to think uncritically. [...] "The show is fiction... it isn't a documentary." [...] In another interview with Justin Trottier of Center for Inquiry Canada Davis answered similarly, adding that from his own informal polls of audiences of X-Files fans it seemed there was no greater belief in the paranormal than the normal population and he comforted himself with <b>this</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E

500|$|Spielberg courted Jack Nicholson for {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Sr. and towards this end, had August compose two {{additional}} drafts for Nicholson's part. August recalls: [...] "There was <b>this</b> <b>thought</b> that there wasn't enough for Jack Nicholson to do in the movie so we built new sequences. Pieces got moved around, but it wasn't a lot of new stuff being created. It ended up being a really good intellectual exercise in my explaining and defending and reanalyzing pieces of the story." [...] Spielberg eventually left Big Fish when he became distracted with Catch Me If You Can (2002), and DreamWorks also backed out of the film.|$|E
500|$|Existence {{resists the}} {{indifference}} {{of life and}} death, it lives beyond mechanical [...] "life," [...] it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is {{the very thought of}} this film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become <b>this</b> <b>thought,</b> so that they become the evidence of this thought—and not in order to [...] "represent" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} positive towards the music video. Fabien Eckert from 20 minutes wrote {{that it was}} appealing to the male audience, noting Inna's lascivious appearance. An editor from RnB Junk similarly said that the singer showed [...] "her model physics" [...] in the clip, and thought that [...] "the clip will make the singer's [...] fans happy as the female audience can simply skip it". Edi of Urban.ro found that [...] "Inndia" [...] was Inna's sexiest and most explicit visual, further noting semi-nude dancers and Inna's portrayal of a lesbian woman.
