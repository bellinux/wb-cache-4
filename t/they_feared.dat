5|$|Farming and {{forestry}} {{are other}} important industries. 2008 {{plans for a}} large salmon farm holding 800,000 or more fish in Lamlash Bay have been criticised by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> the facility could jeopardise Scotland's first marine No Take Zone, which was announced in September 2008.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reaction}} {{within the}} Communist Bloc was mixed. Hungary's János Kádár was highly supportive of Dubček's appointment in January, but Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> might weaken {{the position of}} the Communist Bloc during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May, the {{situation}} in the newly declared State of Israel and the remnants of Palestine was chaotic with the British leaving.

5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E

This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.|$|E
5|$|Before long, the Ottoman {{garrison}} at Ruse also capitulated. Vlad gave asylum to {{more than}} 11,000 Bulgarians who had rebelled against the Ottomans, assisting them to cross the Danube into Wallachia. The Burgundian crusaders and the Wallachians approached Nicopolis, where a Hungarian army {{under the command of}} John Hunyadi joined them on 14 September. However, an early frost forced the crusaders to abandon the campaign in October, because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> that the Danube would freeze over.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned {{himself with the}} autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E

5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E

5|$|In August 2005, Houston {{became a}} shelter {{to more than}} 150,000 people from New Orleans, who {{evacuated}} from Hurricane Katrina. One month later, about 2.5million Houston-area residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving little damage to the Houston area. This was the largest urban evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States. In September 2008, Houston was hit by Hurricane Ike. As many as 40% of residents refused to leave Galveston Island because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> the type of traffic problems that had happened after Hurricane Rita.|$|E
5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1098, the crusaders {{defeated}} Kerbogha in a pitched battle {{outside the}} city, a victory caused by Kerbogha's inability {{to organize the}} different factions in his army.

According to Christian eyewitnesses, an army of Christian saints came {{to the aid of}} the crusaders during the battle and crippled Kerbogha's army.|$|E

Following a suggestion from Robert Henderson, a Canadian prospector, they began looking for gold on Bonanza Creek, then called Rabbit Creek, one of the Klondike's tributaries. It is not clear who discovered the gold: George Carmack or Skookum Jim, but the group agreed to let George Carmack appear as the official discoverer because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> that mining authorities would be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indigenous Person.|$|E
5|$|Smith disbanded Ross's {{company in}} early September 1860. Within a week, Governor Sam Houston {{authorized}} Ross {{to raise his}} own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from the reservations, and <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> Ross's friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins, with Ken Keeler {{coming up with the}} story and the general idea of {{intentionally}} bad writing. It was directed by Neil Affleck, and Tim Conway, Gailard Sartain and Phil Hartman guest-starred. The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> that the purposely bad writing would be mistaken for actual bad writing. The episode, however, now appears on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes.|$|E
