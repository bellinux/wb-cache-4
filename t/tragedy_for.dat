5|$|After the 1836 election, Harrison did {{not really}} stop running for president, nor did his {{supporters}} stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him as early as 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of Hamilton County's circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> the general, as three of his adult children died and his wife Anna fell seriously ill. Harrison {{did his best to}} manage a network of acquaintances and supporters from his home in North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{the hotel}} was {{beginning}} to lose it reputation and a slow decline in popularity began which would culminate in <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> Tony Pike. In 1998, Pike had put the hotel up for sale. A deal was {{set up for the}} sale {{which turned out to be}} a scam and Pike was swindled out of £50,000. His son, Anthony Dale Pike, flew to Miami to resolve the situation for his father. However, he was killed the same day of his arrival on 15 February 1998, shot twice in the head and dumped in a secluded forest at Virginia Key beach. Miami Dade Police detectives believed it was clear that he was killed by the people plotting to seize control of the hotel. The police arrested and questioned German tennis professional Thomas Heinz Knott over the murder, but the investigation led them to charge Italian TV producer Enrico Forti with fraud over the transfer of £50,000 from Anthony’s father. In June 2000, Forti was also convicted of murdering Anthony Dale Pike in Miami. Forti is now serving a lifetime prison sentence at the Everglades Correctional Institution in Florida.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield {{were walking}} through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau. Guiteau, a {{deranged}} man who had earlier pestered Blaine and other State Department officials to be appointed to ambassadorships {{for which he was}} grossly unqualified, believed that by assassinating the President he could ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was captured immediately and hanged just short of a year later; he survived longer than Garfield, who lingered for two-and-a-half months, then died on September 19, 1881. Garfield’s death was not just a personal <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> Blaine; it also meant the end of his dominance of the cabinet and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur’s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway and Blaine’s days at the State Department were numbered. Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December; Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881 but agreed to remain in office until December 19, when his successor was in place. Blaine’s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart. Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine’s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, but they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a reciprocity treaty with Mexico in 1882.|$|E

5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|E

25|$|His {{death was}} {{a blow to the}} Heath government.

25|$|The Clan Ranald {{is one of}} {{the most}} tragic and unique shipwrecks in Australian waters. It {{represents}} one of the worst shipwrecks in Australian history with a massive loss of life. Combined with the grave sites of the officers and the crew in the nearby Edithburgh Cemetery, the Clan Ranald is a somber reminder of a huge <b>tragedy.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, the wreck site and the event itself is very important to the community of the lower Yorke Peninsula, not only because of the disastrous loss of life, but also because they played a major role in aiding the survivors. Even to this day, if you visit the graves, there are fresh flowers near the headstones.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{relationship}} with Sien, van Gogh experienced the loss of support and goodwill from family and friends and his relationship with his parents was further strained. His teacher and cousin-in-law, Anton Mauve, abruptly ceased his support and tutelage within a few weeks of Van Gogh first meeting Sien, although there were other factors involved as well, not least their mutual melancholy. Hulsker called this a simple <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> van Gogh. Likewise, a long-standing family friend, Hermanus Tersteeg, an influential art dealer who taught Vincent and his brother Theo a great deal about art and literature, and who gave Vincent his first set of art supplies when he decided to become an artist, although he was always somewhat equivocal in his support, abruptly withdrew at the same time.|$|E
25|$|William Harry Russell Andrews {{was born}} in Swindon the son of William and Betty Andrews. Betty's maiden name was Russell hence his third name. He had a younger brother Jack Andrews who played 7 matches as a wicket-keeper for Hampshire between 1937 and 1947, and also a sister known as Betty {{who was also a}} cricketer, being captain of a cricket team in Southern Rhodesia. In Swindon his father was a publican but the family moved to Weston-super-Mare in 1921 where Andrews saw the visiting Australians, sold {{scorecards}} and worked the scoreboard. Andrews left school at the age of fourteen and worked as an office boy in a solicitor's office where his fine handwriting was perhaps his greatest asset. There was <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> the family in 1925 when his mother died in childbirth. He played his cricket for the Weston club and learned more about cricket when Arthur Wellard lodged with the Andrews family, having moved to the county in 1927.|$|E

25|$|Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in {{the first}} episode, Crixus the Gaul {{initially}} endures mockery and threats of death, before eventually rising to become a gladiator of skill and fame second only to Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of Quintus' relentless ambition. Former champion gladiator Oenomaus reluctantly retires from combat to become Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan become fierce enemies as Ashur tries to prove himself worthy of being a gladiator. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus accept the rising star of Crixus but fear that their own careers will suffer, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia to court Capua's elite end in <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> {{several members of the}} household.

Gannicus again proves himself to be the champion of Capua and the god of the arena and by virtue of his win against Solonius' gladiators, becomes the champion of Capua and gains his freedom.|$|E
