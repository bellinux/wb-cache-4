5|$|On 18 November, while Allenby {{was at the}} British XXI Corps {{headquarters}} at El Kastine, {{the decision was made}} to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills.

Until 1914, he lived in seclusion in Omdurman or on Aba Island, closely watched by Slatin's intelligence agents. Despite the surveillance he built considerable influence in the White Nile region. He often visited the many mosques in Omdurman to meet his followers with his face covered so {{he would not be}} recognized by government agents. He received many visitors who sought his blessing.|$|E
5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed the Poles {{to mount a}} night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly needed time <b>to</b> <b>regroup</b> and receive reinforcements, which {{came in the form}} of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E
5|$|Although the Spanish had won decisive {{victories}} at Sonsonate and Acajutla, {{they failed}} to take the fortified Pipil cities of Cuscatlan and Izalco.

5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted Pillow, and Floyd intended to countermand the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed <b>to</b> <b>regroup</b> and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{implies that}} this {{occurred}} {{more or less}} directly after Labraunda, {{but it has also}} been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time <b>to</b> <b>regroup.</b> The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Djokovic in {{a two-day}} final in four sets, to ultimately achieve his seventh French Open title and deny Djokovic a Career Grand Slam.

50|$|On {{the night}} of February 28, 1966, the MNF {{launched}} an audacious attack on the district's major towns, resulting in the March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising. It declared independence and called on the Mizos to rise against Delhi. The Indian Government responded by sending troops and aircraft on bombing missions. Villagers were uprooted from the hills and sent <b>to</b> <b>Regrouped</b> Villages built along the highways. For the next 20 years, violence continued in the Mizo hills with the fighters camping in East Pakistan. With the fall of East Pakistan in 1971, Laldenga's men scattered to Myanmar while he moved to Pakistan. After secret meetings in Europe with Indian officials, he returned seeking a peaceful resolution of the problem.|$|R
5|$|Stoke {{improved}} {{after the}} break, but Manchester City {{had a key}} opportunity in the 56th minute when a counter-attack led by Carlos Tevez, who drifted out to the right flank, allowed David Silva to find space outside the Stoke City penalty area as the Stoke defence vanished. Tevez managed to pass to Silva, but Silva was guilty of over-elaboration instead of shooting first-time, and the Stoke City defence managed <b>to</b> <b>regroup,</b> dispossessing Silva before he could adjust himself to shoot at goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit led to British {{domination}} {{over most of}} Michigan Territory. Brock had planned to continue his campaign into the U.S., but he was thwarted by negotiation of an armistice by Prevost with American Major General Henry Dearborn. This stalled Brock's momentum, and gave the Americans time <b>to</b> <b>regroup</b> and prepare to invade Canada. Unable to predict the point of invasion, Brock frantically worked to prepare defences throughout Upper Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost {{the element of}} surprise. The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided <b>to</b> <b>regroup</b> in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians {{at the spot where}} they were originally discovered and assault the pillbox there, {{while the rest of the}} forces would try a turning movement.|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary <b>to</b> <b>regroup.</b>|$|E
5|$|At dusk, the Japanese {{turned away}} to the {{northwest}} <b>to</b> <b>regroup</b> and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during {{the afternoon of the}} following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched. They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to ditch. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba <b>to</b> <b>regroup</b> his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and they found {{that some of the}} Dutch soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered.|$|E
