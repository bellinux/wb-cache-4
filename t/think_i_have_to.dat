500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Escobar (2009) {{was delayed}} because of {{producer}} Oliver Stone's {{involvement with the}} George W. Bush biopic W. (2008). The release date of Escobar remains unconfirmed.. Regarding the film, Stone said: [...] "This is a great project about a fascinating man who took on the system. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> thank Scarface, and maybe even Ari Gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Samantha and {{eliminate}} Rachel, although he expressed severe disappointment with the result, saying [...] "Last night Cameron and I were both {{saying that we}} thought both of you would be fantastic Nancys and now here am I faced with this. But I've {{got to make a}} decision and I've got to think of where the show ultimately for Cameron is going to go and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go with you Samantha.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{very sweet}} in you," [...] she said; and perhaps {{she would have}} praised in the same terms the {{precisely}} opposite sentiment. [...] "It's some comfort," [...] she added, with a deep-fetched sigh, [...] "to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{make some}} of them saints. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make Enraghty Saint Paul, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make Hingston Saint Peter. You <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lie to them, to deceive them, to bewitch them. <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do {{anything}} of the kind. They did the lying and deceiving and bewitching themselves, and when they done it, they {{and all the rest}} of the believers, they had me fast, faster than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] Burton replied. [...] "I rather <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> my senses. <b>Have</b> you {{got those}} last {{furniture}} accounts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear it? What do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, then? I am not {{to marry}} you, and that's enough. Your letter was {{excellently}} plain. I {{want you to}} hear nothing--not I." ...|$|E
6000|$|As Clym {{descended into}} the valley Thomasin came down by the other path, and {{met him at the}} gate. [...] "What do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell you, Clym?" [...] she said, looking archly over her {{shoulder}} at him.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} the sitting-room of their cot {{up the hill}} she found it empty, and from a change perceptible {{in the position of}} small articles of furniture, something unusual seemed to have taken place in her absence. The dwelling being of that sort in which whatever goes on in one room is audible through all the rest, Picotee, who was upstairs, heard the arrival and came down. Picotee's face was rosed over with the brilliance of some excitement. 'What do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell you, Berta?' she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Festing. [...] "The {{trouble is}} I haven't much, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> enough <b>to</b> provide all that's {{strictly}} necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vulgar? Modest, I call it. I've {{never said}} anything, but d'you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> like <b>having</b> <b>to</b> {{look at those}} naked people all day long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, has he not? What could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done? What ought <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done? Tell me, Mr. Harcourt. It distresses me beyond {{measure that}} you should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>to</b> blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|Whatever {{time this}} {{explanation}} might have taken, {{there had been}} moments enough in the matter now--before the elder woman's conscience had done itself justice--to enable Milly to reply that although the fact in question doubtless had its importance she imagined they wouldn't find the importance overwhelming. It was odd that their one Englishman should so instantly fit; it wasn't, however, miraculous--they surely all had often seen that, as every one said, the world was extraordinarily [...] "small." [...] Undoubtedly, too, Susie had done just the plain thing in not letting his name pass. Why in the world {{should there be a}} mystery?--and what an immense one they would appear to have made if he should come back and find they had concealed their knowledge of him! [...] "I don't know, Susie dear," [...] the girl observed, [...] "what you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> conceal." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before {{the day was}} out Lady Albury {{did find}} her husband to be correct. Captain Batsby, though he was very jealous of his secret, {{acknowledged}} to himself the necessity of having one confidant. He could hardly, he thought, follow Ayala without some assistance. He knew nothing of Mrs. Dosett, nothing of Kingsbury Crescent, and very little as to Ayala herself. He regarded Lady Albury as his chosen friend, and generally communicated to her whatever troubles he might have. These had consisted chiefly of the persecutions {{to which he had}} been subjected by the mothers of portionless young ladies. How not to get married off against his will had been the difficulty of his life. His half sister-in-law had hitherto preserved him, and therefore to her he now went for assistance in this opposite affair. [...] "Rosalind," [...] he said in his gravest voice, [...] "what do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'He didn't summons me--because I'm in the House, <b>I</b> suppose. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask a Question,' said Pallant, reappearing at {{the close}} of the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so." [...] The Russian {{naval officer}} smiled in a knowing way. [...] "Captain Ponsberry, I am sorry, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> inspect your papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know what's come to {{my uncle}} of late," [...] said Hugh, after a while. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> drop them at the rectory altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{compared}} Tozer to the pianists Emil Gilels, Arthur Rubinstein, Sviatoslav Richter, Ferruccio Busoni, Artur Schnabel, and the soprano Maria Callas, {{who died}} alone in Paris in 1977. Keating said, [...] "In the end, his liver failed. But I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say we all let him down. ... We should have cared more and done more." ...|$|E
5000|$|The poems evoke {{a series}} of images to {{highlight}} the ambiguities in modern-day life. Although situated in a religious setting, they are not religious; in 1978, an interviewer {{asked him if he}} believed in God, and Kolatkar said: ‘I leave the question alone. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take a position about God one way or the other.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} before the 2013-14 season, Radionova said: [...] "I don't think that I am {{such a great}} athlete that won a lot. I just won the smallest one, Junior Worlds. In reality, there are competitions that are much more serious and more difficult. I don't feel any pressure yet. I just <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work harder and more, {{because there is no}} limit to perfection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Done? I cannot fancy it!' said Wilmet. 'Do you know, <b>I</b> {{believe it}} <b>has</b> been my bugbear for years past <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> persuade her to this?' ...|$|R
5000|$|On the Bennett {{students}}' 1960 protest:"We don't {{teach our}} students what to think. We teach how <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give exams in jail, that's what I'll do. - Willa B. Player ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admit {{you to the}} Blue Bowl League, Mr. Ericson. Speaking of which----Tell me, who did {{introduce}} us, you and me? I feel so apologetic for not remembering." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ware often {{refers to}} himself in the {{publicity}} {{for his work in}} self-effacing, even withering tones. He is considered by some critics and fellow notable illustrators and writers, such as Dave Eggers, to be among the best currently working in the medium; Canadian graphic-novelist Seth has said, [...] "Chris really changed the playing field. After him, a lot of cartoonists really started to scramble and go, 'Holy expletive, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> try harder.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Samantha and {{eliminate}} Rachel, although he expressed severe disappointment with the result, saying [...] "Last night Cameron and I were both {{saying that we}} thought both of you would be fantastic Nancys and now here am I faced with this.

5000|$|In week nine, Barks {{received}} the lowest number of public votes {{and so had}} {{to participate in the}} sing-off with Rachel Tucker. They sang [...] "Memory" [...] from the musical Cats. Andrew Lloyd Webber chose to save Barks and eliminate Tucker saying, [...] "Last night Cameron and I were both saying that we thought both of you would be fantastic Nancys and now here am I faced with this. But I've got to make a decision and I've got to think of where the show ultimately for Cameron is going to go and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go with you, Samantha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure it is}} {{my great}} delight," [...] said Marian; [...] "I {{do not know what}} I should do without hearing from Agnes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> learnt <b>to</b> prize her more since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known other people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Children," [...] said Old Pipes, [...] "I'm {{very tired}} tonight, and I don't believe I can climb up this steep path to my home. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{ask you to}} help me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby laughed almost light-heartedly. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> enough <b>to</b> take us all {{out at the}} {{cheapest}} rates, and you must let me lend it to you, if only to prove that {{what you believe in}} isn't an impracticable fancy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{appeared}} in court {{wearing a black}} and gray striped shirt over his costume on October 13, 2011. A court officer asked Jones to remove his mask, and he complied, putting the mask back on after the hearing. Jones then spoke with reporters and removed his mask again to reveal his identity as Ben Fodor. Fodor stated that he would continue patrolling the city: I will continue to patrol with my team, probably tonight 13, 2011. In addition to being Phoenix Jones, I am also Ben Fodor, father and brother. I am just like everybody else. The {{only difference is that}} I try to stop crime in my neighborhood and everywhere else. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look toward the future and see what I can do to help the city.|$|E
50|$|This is {{my first}} car in life, a three-door version SUV left the factory in 2005. Its body is pure yellow, and the inner space {{consists}} of black and red. I bought it on a second-hand car market {{in the middle of}} 2008. I can’t tell it is Made-in-China or Made-in-Japan. It is not because when I bought it the former owner had already changed the original car logo into another Japanese car logo under which trademark has another car identical in appearance but different in performance with this one, but because that the Chinese manufacturer of this car has used Japanese production line and pattern die to produce the car almost identical to Japanese car in China, which means the car is not some product surrogated by Japanese company to manufacture or sell in China. Considering the relatively tense relationship between China and Japan recently, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make some assistive clarification about the individual case of the car.|$|E
5000|$|At the semi-final stage, week nine, Tucker was in {{the bottom}} two for a third time, {{together}} with Samantha Barks, who had received the lowest number of viewers votes. They sang [...] "Memory" [...] from the musical Cats. Cameron Mackintosh joined the judging panel for this episode. Lloyd Webber chose to save Barks and eliminate Tucker saying: [...] "Last night Cameron and I were both saying that we thought both of you would be fantastic Nancys and now here am I faced with this. But I've {{got to make a}} decision and I've got to think of where the show ultimately for Cameron is going to go and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go with you Samantha. A week after the show, Lloyd Webber said: [...] "The fact is Cameron wanted Rachel to stay. He wanted Rachel and Samantha in the final {{from the beginning of the}} series. Rachel did a fantastic performance but I had to face up to the fact that she wouldn't have gone any further. What I may think professionally is sometimes different to what the public want. I saved Rachel three times and she still ended up in the bottom two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to ask you, Mr. Van Teyl," [...] he inquired, [...] "whether your Japanese servant was {{altogether}} a success? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get a temporary servant while I am over here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a fool, Sam Dickson," [...] {{his wife}} said, sharply. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived <b>to</b> {{the age of}} forty-five, and don't know a child's cry, when I hear it? Now {{are you going to}} get up, or am I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} {{interfere}} with your conscience in this matter, Robert; and my own feelings, American as I am by birth and family, rather incline me to think as you <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wished <b>to</b> see you, my son, on a different business." ...|$|R
