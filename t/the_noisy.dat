5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said that his parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in <b>the</b> <b>noisy</b> restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{probably}} breeds {{throughout its}} range. The breeding season is from June to January, {{with one or}} two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy deep bowl of sticks and bits of bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. Pandanus palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), <b>the</b> <b>noisy</b> miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (Melaleuca) which had been lined with messmate bark had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or rarely three eggs are laid, 22 × 32mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs, over a period of 16 or 17 days.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of <b>the</b> <b>noisy</b> arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E

40|$|Concerns about {{increases}} in offshore ambient noise due to commercial shipping {{have resulted in}} a work program by the International Maritime Organization to develop technical guidelines to reduce shipping noise. Targets to reduce the contribution from shipping noise to ambient noise have also been endorsed by the IWC Scientific Committee. At frequencies below 300 Hz, the underwater noise signature from large vessels will be dominated by propeller cavitation and <b>the</b> <b>noisiest</b> vessels are likely to be those that suffer excessive cavitation. Based on the distribution of source levels across merchant fleets, <b>the</b> <b>noisiest</b> 10 % of vessels may contribute between around 48 % and 88 % of the total sea area ensonified by shipping noise to a given level, depending on assumptions about propagation conditions. Thus noise reduction targets could most easily be achieved by targeting measures at a relatively small percentage of <b>the</b> <b>noisiest</b> vessels. These measures may also result in efficiency savings which could pay back initial costs within 1 or 2 years. Reductions in overall ambient noise achieved through quieting <b>the</b> <b>noisiest</b> vessels may also assist whales in avoiding collisions with quieter vessels and contribute to a reduction in ship strike mortality. Many data gaps remain in the understanding of factors that contribute to the variation in noise output from different vessels and there is a clear need for systematic studies of vessel noise. The equipment and deployment of recording devices for studies of whale vocalisations, combined with individual vessel tracking, may provide opportunities to obtain data on noise signatures from ships...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than <b>the</b> <b>noisy,</b> hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.|$|E

Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the red-eared firetail (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the karri forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and <b>the</b> <b>noisy</b> scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies.

25|$|Theoretical ecology is the {{scientific}} discipline {{devoted to the}} study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding <b>the</b> <b>noisy,</b> diverse biological world.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} pittas {{are found in}} South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus Pitta is the most widespread.

The most remote insular endemics are in this group as well, including the black-faced pitta, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The pittas of the clade Erythropitta are mostly found in Asia with one species, the Papuan pitta, reaching the north of Australia. The Hydrornis pittas are exclusively Asian. Some pittas have large distributions, like the hooded pitta, which ranges from Nepal to New Guinea, others have much smaller ones, like the superb pitta, which is endemic to the tiny island of Manus in the Admiralty Islands.|$|E
