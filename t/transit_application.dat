However, the GPS data is usually not directly accessible by passengers, but is used to provide real-time arrival estimates. This thesis attempts to approximate the locations of vehicles using the available real-time arrival estimates, through a smartphone application named TransitVision. By utilizing the SIRI standard(www. siri. org. uk), TransitVision is interoperable with other {{public transportation}} agencies. A preliminary study on travelers' habits and perceived waiting time, created a solid foundation for TransitVision. This thesis also includes a study into the state-of-the-art, to examine other applications, technologies and discover limitations. The study included a thorough examination of several SIRI implementations, to consider how to incorporate them in TransitVision. Finally, 15 testers evaluated the application's usability through the System Usability Scale([URL] The preliminary study indicated that mobile <b>transit</b> <b>application</b> users believed they waited on average five minutes, which {{was about the same}} as those using non-digital retrieval methods. TransitVision was initially developed for Oslo, but was also tested on transit data from Tampere. It worked well in both cities, confirming TransitVision's interoperability.

40|$|Public transit {{provides}} an indispensable service {{to many of}} those who make major cities their home. At the same time, smartphones have become a commonplace but powerful piece of consumer technology, whose relevance to its users' daily lives only promises to increase in the years to come. This paper discusses the intersection of these two fields, in the form of smartphone applications that provide realtime public transit information. Using data from the server logs of two real-time transit applications (Any Stop and TreKing), <b>transit</b> <b>application</b> users in Chicago, Illinois are compared with overall ridership of local public transit, to determine if they are analogous. Using odds ratio and scatter plots,it can be shown that these two groups ride transit in markedly similar manners: smartphone users demonstrate classic usage peaks during both morning and evening rush hours, and their ridership across one hundred and thirty transit routes parallels overall transit usage with 70 - 86 % accuracy. Aggregate travel data also illustrates overall patterns in how and why smartphone owners use their devices to navigate public transit. This paper then considers variables that might account for discrepancies between these two populations: recorded transit app usage demonstrated negative correlation with factors such as total hours of service and number of stops. positive correlation for spatial complexity, and statistically insignificant or inconclusive results for route length, stops per mile, and buses per hour. This type of crowdsourced, realtime travel data could very well provide transit planners with substantial insights into public transit, which might then be used to improve city transit services...|$|E

It consists of two squared metal hooks that engage with each other in a larger rectangular frame with air line connections above and below. Since the coupler's development the manufacturing arm of Ohio Brass was purchased by WABCO which now manufacturers the line along with the N-type. The Tomlinson coupler is the most widely used fully automatic heavy rail coupling in North America having been adopted by the DC Metro, MBTA, PATCO Speedline, SEPTA Broad Street Subway, LA Metro, Baltimore Metro, Miami Metro, MARTA Rail and the New York City Subway for its R44/R46 fleet and all modern classes starting with the R142. For applications outside of rapid transit the coupler had to be significantly enlarged to meet the increased strength requirements first appearing in this capacity on the Budd Metroliner and later on the Illinois Central Highliner fleet. Its relative lack of strength is one reason the N-Type has been more successful in the mainline railroad arena.|$|R
