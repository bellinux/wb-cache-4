5|$|Most {{people should}} like their name. Those {{that do not}} should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> rated their name {{relatively}} highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|The invitations were {{distributed}} among 450leading citizens and {{officials in the}} capital. The Cabildo compiled the guest list, and tried to guarantee the result, inviting people that {{would be likely to}} support the Viceroy. The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would be against Cisneros instead. The printer Agustín Donado, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600invitations instead of the 450requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos. During the night, Castelli, Rodríguez, French and Beruti visited all the barracks to harangue the troops and prepare them for the following day.|$|E
5000|$|Grip {{strength}} training requires {{a different type}} of training regimen than other muscular training. The reasons are primarily based on the interplay of the tendons and muscles and the lack of [...] "down time" [...] or rest <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people's</b> hands get.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated {{the men from}} the women and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E
5|$|Wong stated <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> {{take for}} granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test {{at different times}} or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E

60|$|In {{all these}} matters, looking back upon what I was taught, {{comparing}} it with what I now know, and comparing my mind with {{the minds of}} more fortunate individuals, I cannot resist the persuasion that I was very badly done indeed in this section. And it is small consolation to me to note <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people's</b> minds seem to be no better done than mine.|$|R
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
25|$|German Archbishop Heiner Koch said <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> {{he spoke}} to {{understood}} the admittance of remarried Catholics to the Eucharist {{as a matter of}} charity and mercy, not of the indissolubility of marriage.|$|E

50|$|When the Emersons {{return to}} Luxor, they concoct a story <b>that</b> for <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would be implausible, but does bear some {{resemblance}} to previous adventures, {{so no one}} asks much about it.|$|R
50|$|Newer {{studies also}} {{consistently}} show that Dutch anti-German sentiment has been falling steadily for years, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Dutch <b>people</b> today show a positive view towards both Germany and the German people.|$|R
25|$|The 1879 opera Eugene Onegin, by Tchaikovsky, {{based on}} the story, is perhaps the version <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> are {{familiar}} with. There are many recordings of the score, {{and it is one}} of the most commonly performed operas in the world.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} at the Society of Authors awards {{ceremony}} in June 2008 <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> realised that the author {{was in fact a}} man: 'Many initially assumed Boyle must be Walker's agent when he walked up to accept the £4,000 McMitterick Prize'.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeals {{ruled in}} 1991 <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> arrested must be {{released}} {{if they are}} not arraigned within 24 hours. In 2013, {{for the first time since}} 2001, the average time it took to arraign defendants fell below 24 hours in all five boroughs.|$|E
5000|$|Bet v I {{allergen}} is {{a family}} of protein allergens. Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions {{of the immune system}} to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) <b>that,</b> in <b>most</b> <b>people,</b> result in no symptoms.|$|R

25|$|Later studies support {{coevolution}} in that dogs can discriminate {{the emotional}} expressions of human faces, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> {{can tell from}} a bark whether a dog is alone, being approached by a stranger, playing, or being aggressive, and can tell from a growl how big the dog is.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} are {{infected}} with {{only a small number}} of worms have no symptoms. It is common to find <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> are infected by a small number of worms, while a small number of people are heavily infected, something that is characteristic of many worm infections.|$|E
25|$|Reef-keeping enthusiasts {{have begun}} {{to build their own}} LED light {{fixtures}} as well. Debate over their effectiveness towards coral is still inconclusive, particularly with respect to their ability to give off UV radiation, critical to obtaining a vibrant array of colors <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> interested in LED lighting are looking for.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the size}} of the opening for filling the bladder, it may be {{convenient}} to include, in hot weather, ice cubes or crushed ice when filling it. In theory too much ice means running out of liquid water while the bladder still has ice occupying space that could have been filled by more water (so it helps to take account of how temperature and humidity affect the balance between consumption rate and melting rate), but it helps <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people's</b> tendency seems to be to put in less ice than would last through the hike.|$|R
50|$|For poor law {{purposes}} district electoral divisions {{replaced the}} civil parishes {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century. Townlands are the smallest land unit in Ireland, and were the <b>most</b> precise address <b>that</b> <b>most</b> rural <b>people</b> have until the 2015 introduction of postcodes.|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 {{video game}} Dark Sector, protagonist Hayden Tenno suffers from this condition. This becomes a plot {{point when he}} is {{infected}} by a virus <b>that</b> drives <b>most</b> <b>people</b> insane due to the severe pain it causes in victims, which {{he is unable to}} feel.|$|R
25|$|Seventh-day Adventists {{have often}} focused on those doctrines which are {{distinctive}} to Adventism. This was {{particularly true in}} the early days of the movement, when it was assumed <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> the church witnessed to were already Christian to begin with, and that they already understood the gospel.|$|E
25|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> in Ireland {{belonged to}} some religion, {{and that the}} {{education}} system {{and to a lesser}} extent the health system were denominational in structure, with Roman Catholicism, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Jewish community and others running their own schools and non-governmental agencies.|$|E
25|$|The critic Camille Paglia has {{promoted}} bisexuality as an ideal. Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life, {{in which she}} argued <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.|$|E
60|$|Susan's {{point of}} view seemed to be <b>that</b> of <b>most</b> <b>people.</b> Leslie {{was the only one}} who sympathised understandingly with Anne. She had a good cry, too, when she heard the news. Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the {{preparations}} for moving.|$|R
60|$|Dutton and the {{lieutenant}} smiled, but Sir Wycherly's simplicity had {{a cast of}} truth and nature about it, <b>that</b> deterred <b>most</b> <b>people</b> from wishing to ridicule him. Then, the rank, fortune, and local interest of the baronet, counted for a good deal on all such occasions.|$|R
