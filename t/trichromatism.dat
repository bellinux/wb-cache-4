50|$|Like catarrhines, howler monkeys (a {{family of}} platyrrhines) show routine <b>trichromatism</b> {{that has been}} traced to an {{evolutionarily}} recent gene duplication. Howler monkeys {{are one of the}} most specialized leaf-eaters of the New World monkeys; fruits are not a major part of their diets, and the type of leaves they prefer to consume (young, nutritive, and digestible) are detectable only by a red-green signal. Field work exploring the dietary preferences of howler monkeys suggests that routine trichromaticism was selected by environment.|$|E
30|$|Dysfunction of cones (e.g., {{resulting}} in spectral sensitivity peak shift or shape alteration) can heavily {{affect the way}} color are perceived. Color vision deficiency has place when cone cells exhibit a partial or complete loss of function. The main types of CVD are known as anomalous <b>trichromatism,</b> dichromatism and monochromatism.|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} {{genetic analysis}} of the long-wavelength opsin (OPN 1 LW, “red”) color vision gene in a global sample of 236 human nucleotide sequences had previously discovered nine amino acid replacement single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were found at high frequencies in both African and non-African populations and associated with an unusual haplotype diversity. Although this pattern of nucleotide diversity is consistent with balancing selection, {{it has been argued}} that a recombination “hot spot” or gene conversion within and between X-linked color vision genes alone may explain these patterns. The current analysis investigates a closely related primate with <b>trichromatism</b> to determine whether color vision gene amino acid polymorphism and signatures of adaptive evolution are characteristic of humans alone. Our population sample of 56 chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) OPN 1 LW sequences shows three singleton amino acid polymorphisms and no unusual recombination or linkage disequilibrium patterns across the ∼ 5. 5 -kb region analyzed. Our comparative population genetic approach shows that the patterns of OPN 1 LW variation in humans and chimpanzees are consistent with positive and purifying selection within the two lineages, respectively. Although the complex role of color vision has been greatly documented in primate evolution in general, it is surprising that <b>trichromatism</b> has followed very different selective trajectories even between humans and our closest relatives...|$|E
40|$|Acquired {{disturbances}} {{of color}} vision are a highly varied group of defects with frequent departures from established patterns. They can progress from nor-mal <b>trichromatism</b> to anomalous <b>trichromatism</b> on to a dichromatic stage and to monochromatism where most color vision is lost, {{or they may}} be relatively stable [1]. A significant “modern effort ” to present such conditions was published for first time in 1972 [2], attention was drawn in a significant account given 15 years later by Jaeger and Krastel empha-sizing pharmaco-therapeutical effects [3]. Normally, dopaminergic neurons act in the outer and inner retina at multiple levels, producing alterations to the flow of visual information in a complex fashion. Dopamine is a chemical messenger for light adaptation, promoting the flow of information through cone circuits while dimin-ishing that through rod circuits [4]. Color vision relies on the cone photoreceptor population and is therefore largely confined to the central retina. Because there is a segregation of color-specific information at the retinal into blue-yellow and red-green pathways, it is possi-ble to use color discrimination tasks to assess cone and retinal ganglion cell subpopulations [4]. It has been reported that color vision is impaired in Parkinson’s disease (PD) [5] and some works have suggested that these disturbances to color vision affect predominantly the short-wave cone pathway [6]. Birch suggested that the acquired type three (tritan) defect at the reti-nal level as an early diagnostic sign of Parkinson’...|$|E
30|$|Anomalous <b>trichromatism</b> {{is due to}} a {{sensitivity}} peak shift of one of the fundamental cones. This deficiency is further classified in protanomaly, when malfunction is given by L cones, and deuteranomaly, when the disorder is associated to M cones. Depending on the extent the peak is shifted, the perception of anomalous trichromats can range from almost normal to dichromatic vision. Indeed, it has been estimated (DeMarco et al. 1992) that on average the peaks are respectively at 440, 543 and 566 nm for standard average vision, at 440, 543 and 553 for protanomalous trichromats, while deuteranomalous trichromats show peaks at 440, 560 and 566 nm. Therefore, vision deficiency is due to the lower distance between L and M sensitivity peaks (i.e.,respectively 10 and 6 nm).|$|E
40|$|To {{perform their}} job safely firefighters {{must be able}} to {{identify}} colours on industrial gas cylinders, portable fire extinguishers, road traffic signals and several pieces of firefighting equipment. Although good colour vision is necessary we believe that the existing colour vision standard, which bars entry to the fire service to applicants who fail more than two plates of the Ishihara test, is unnecessarily stringent. We have identified and quantified the colour coded information encountered by firefighters. Colours were plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram (1931) and isochromatic zones, which document the colour confusions of colour deficient observers, superimposed. This novel technique established possible colour confusions in different types of colour deficiency. Analysis of the results showed that red/green dichromats (protanopes and deuteranopes), severe deuteranomalous trichromats who fail the Farnsworth D 15 test, and protanomalous trichromats are unsuitable for firefighting work. However, people with slight deuteranomalous <b>trichromatism</b> who pass the D 15 test, are not disadvantaged and can be employed safely as firefighters. A new colour vision standard and a new testing procedure is recommended...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Threshold {{spectral}} sensitivities (in the dark, {{or against}} bright colored backgrounds) are identical in the red-green range for both protanopes (dichromats) and protanomalous trichromatic color defectives. The latter, however, {{must have an}} additional photolabile cone pigment in the red-green range, and its presence is revealed by heterochromatic brightness matching through the spectrum (i. e. luminosity curves). The absorption spectrum of the anomalous cone pigment can be inferred from the protanomalous and protanopic luminosity curve, given reasonable assumptions {{as to how the}} different cone mechanisms pool their responses. Depending upon these assumptions, the pigment inferred is either (a) dilute solution of the normal red pigment (assumed density 1. 0 for the deuteranope) or (b) similar in its absorption spectrum to the normal green pigment but shifted slightly toward the long wave end of the spectrum. Experimental attempts to choose between these alternatives have so far proved equivocal though (b) seems more likely on the basis of indirect evidence. Protanomalous <b>trichromatism</b> [...] an anomaly of color vision which affects about 1 % of the male, and 0. 02 % of the female, population [...] is operationally defined by the need for a larger than normal amount of red in a red-green mixture matched to a yellow (Rayleigh, 1881). In a previous paper (Alpern and Torii, 1968 a) it was shown that the only reasonable explanation is that the absorption spectrum of {{at least one of the}} three cone visual pigments in protanomalous trichromats is different from the comparable normal pigment(s). The nature of this spectrum (or spectra) is a mystery, since by the usual techniques for measuring action spectra of visual pigments in living human eyes, namely retinal densitometry (Rushton, 1963) and two-color thresholds (Stiles, 1939, 1959), protanomalous trichromats cannot be distinguished fro...|$|E
