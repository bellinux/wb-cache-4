40|$|About a year ago, I asked Prof. Dr. Leo Storme for a {{possible}} subject for my mas-ter dissertation, preferably in my favourite mathematical domains, i. e. coding theory and geometry. He suggested me among others to consider random network coding, a recently established powerful concept for information transmission in a network, with widespread applications for communication networks like the Internet, wireless commu-nication systems and cloud computing. In the recent award-winning article of Kötter and Kschischang ([28]), the network {{is viewed as a}} mechanism of transmitting not pack-ets or vectors but rather the subspace that these packets span, which leads to a new kind of coding theory employing subspace codes. After reading <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very enthusiastic to look into this subject in more depth, to explore the links between new and traditional concepts in different domains and to try to describe this in my thesis, which can be seen as an introduction to the mathematical part of random network coding and designs over Fq.

Our experience of the world could only be mediated through self-conscious sense data and thought, without our being in direct contact with the satisfaction of our needs or the consequences of our actions. This new conception of subjectivity has become an impediment to judgment, since splitting the actor from the spectator, and the judge from the life of the community, results in a denial of the capacity to interpret facts in the light of experience...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} 35 years, {{professionals}} in the field of early childhood special educationhave demonstrated great advances in social skills interventions for young childrenwith disabilities. We no longer question if social behavior is important or if we can teach children social behaviors. Despite what we have learned, much work remains. In <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> identify three areas in which work is still needed: (a) working with fami-lies to define social outcomes in a meaningful and culturally relevant manner; (b) ex-panding our definition of social behaviors and moving toward a framework based on social relationships rather than social skills; and (c) developing interventions that are socially valid, ecologically valid, and sustainable across settings. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asked to write <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite hon-ored that the editor of Topics in Early Childhood Special Education thought I had something visionary to say about social skills interventions for young children with dis-abilities. However, once the initial euphoria wore off, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stymied about how to begin. I turned to my dictio-nary; a definition of the &dquo;visionary&dquo; might help me de-termine the focus of the paper. According to Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (1994), a visionary is one &dquo;given to or characterized by fanciful, not presently work-able or unpractical ideas, views or schemes&dquo; (p. 1597). Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little less flattered, but <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> called worse, and this definition did provide some direction. In <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>I</b> hope to outline my ideas about inter-ventions that can facilitate meaningful social outcomes for young children with disabilities. I also hope to con-tradict the dictionary definition by providing ideas that are practical, achievable, sustainable, considered accept-able by consumers, and result in outcomes that are con-sidered to be important to those consumers. I will also discuss some of my recent work in facilitating social re-lationships for young children with disabilities and hope that this work provides some examples of intervention-based research that is innovative and practical...|$|R
