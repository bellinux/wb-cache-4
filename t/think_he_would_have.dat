25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture {{producer}} (I forget who) {{asked him to}} do a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.|$|E
500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group were}} not sociable with reporters, and {{according}} to the book Morrison's drinking habits made him reclusive. [...] "I regret that we couldn't have controlled Morrison better... I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Savernake, a sculptor, and {{cousin of}} Sir Henry, Lucy, Midge, Edward and David. She always knows {{the right words}} to say to make someone feel comfortable, albeit {{sometimes}} {{at the expense of}} the truth. Her art is the core of her being, which, at times, conflicts with her second important characteristic. She loves John Christow more than life itself yet abets his killer because she <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted her to do so, under the circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done that; {{there could}} have been no object for his putting the power of {{demanding}} his money and valuables out of his possession." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{recurring}} theme is {{the decline of}} civilisation; Cerdic often comments on the illiteracy of the Saxons and their simple adherence to custom, and on the advantages which his late Roman education gives him in thinking out his moves in advance. He also notes the decay of Roman buildings as they are abandoned and plundered and the dirt and uncleanliness of even Saxon nobles (whereas Roman nobles such as Cerdic himself in his youth bathed frequently). In his old age Cerdic sometimes <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred to be a Roman nobleman even though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> enjoyed as much personal freedom.|$|R
500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brianâ€“ give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|His {{decision}} {{left the}} field wide open for candidates, and a hotly contested race resulted {{in both the}} Republican and Democratic Party of Oregon primaries that year. Craig Berkman, Oregon Republican chairman at the time, {{was reported to be}} disappointed at Crookham's decision not to run. [...] "Frankly, this makes it very difficult for the Republican Party," [...] Berkman is quoted as saying. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made an excellent candidate, but I can hardly blame him for not wanting to commit to an office that he would be in until at least age 73." ...|$|E
2500|$|He toured New Zealand at the season's end {{and due to}} his keeping ability, Australia did {{not send}} a reserve for Barry Jarman. Burge said [...] "Cricket had been {{so much a part}} of Dad's life that I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted me to go." [...] He started the tour with a 105 against Canterbury and later made 81 not out against Auckland, but did not {{otherwise}} pass 50. New Zealand had Test status at the time, but the Australian Board of Control refused to ratify the matches between the two nations as such. Burge had little impact in three international matches, scoring 115 runs at 28.75 as Australia took the series 10. He ended the New Zealand tour with 310 runs at 38.75.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Did {{you ever}} know {{anything}} so unlucky? But {{he had promised}} Mr. Sowerby before he heard that you were coming. Pray do not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone away had he known it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, {{a little}} timidly, [...] "I don't {{understand}} this at all, {{but it is}} terribly tragic. Do you <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lived if <b>he</b> had not undertaken the journey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thy {{will be done}} on earth.' He who bade us {{ask that}} boon for generations yet unborn, was very God of very God. Do you <b>think</b> that <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> bidden us ask a blessing, which <b>He</b> knew <b>would</b> never come? ...|$|R
2500|$|Stephen Peck, son of actor Gregory Peck, also {{expressed}} concern. Responding {{to the question}} of how he thought his father would have reacted to the book, he said that he [...] "would have appreciated the discussion the book has prompted, but would have been troubled by the decision to publish it." [...] Peck noted that his father considered Lee a dear friend. She gave him the pocket watch that had belonged to her father, on whom she modeled Atticus and that Gregory wore it the night he won an Oscar for the role. Stephen, who is president and chief executive of the United States Veterans Initiative, went on to say [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felt very protective of her," [...] and that his father would have counseled Lee not to publish Watchman because it could taint Mockingbird, one of the most beloved novels (in) American history.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{explained}} that Lucky and Elizabeth's mutual unfortunate life circumstances were {{a major factor}} in their growing relationship, stating: [...] "They automatically had a chance to prove to each other {{that they were going to}} be there through some of the worst stuff. And they passed." [...] Jackson also felt that the couple's relationship was crucial to Lucky's growth and acceptance of his parents, stating to Soaps In Depth in 1999: [...] "I think it was through that relationship and that love that Lucky obtained a sense of peace that made him want to mend things with his parents more. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done it otherwise." [...] When Jackson left the series in April 1999, Lucky and Elizabeth's teenage romance ends as Lucky is presumed dead in a fire. The couple attempts reconciliation from 2000 to 2002 during Jacob Young's tenure, and reunites in 2005 while Greg Vaughan played the role. Lucky and Elizabeth have an on-and-off relationship throughout the years that includes marriages, infidelity and children. Herbst explained portraying the relationship through different actors to Comcast in 2010: [...] "The characters are still the same. Each individual actor chose to play him a little differently. You just roll with it. Each relationship was different. They all had their uniqueness." ...|$|E
60|$|But I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{consented to}} accept his liberty with three hundred a year,--so great to him was the relief.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Bella, tell me {{what the}} {{governor}} said to you." [...] Then she showed him the ring. [...] "Did he give you that?" [...] She nodded her head in assent. [...] "I did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> parted with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dared strike me," [...] {{replied the}} girl, [...] "though he {{threatened}} to do so. He is the coward who murdered poor Mr. Mallory upon the Lotus. He might stoop to anything after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Mannering {{appears to}} have your {{interests}} very much at heart," [...] Berenice said, quietly. [...] "She proved herself quite a match for Sir Leslie. I <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left here at once, only we are expecting Clara back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> abstained from telling you, {{because he}} might have thought you would have {{considered}} it a rash speculation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a better}} career in London?" [...] said Lily, {{speaking}} {{under the influence}} of her superior presence of mind.|$|E
60|$|If that Lion {{had been}} a Tiger, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed the man, whether he wished to eat him or not.|$|E
60|$|But {{how to get}} out was the {{difficult}} matter. And indeed I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> got out at all, but have stayed there till the cock-robins covered him with leaves, if he had not suddenly run his head against a wall.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because,' {{continued}} Agnes, 'Doctor Strong {{has acted}} on his intention of retiring, and {{has come to}} live in London; and he asked papa, I know, if he could recommend him one. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> his favourite old pupil near him, than anybody else?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bellamy is {{not even}} on the train," [...] Von Behrling protested. [...] "He went north to Berlin. That itself is the proof that they know nothing. If he had had the merest suspicion, do you not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> stayed with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Constance. 'Oh, aunt, I am so sorry! I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done it if {{the other}} boys had not teased him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If he had, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wronged me. He met {{you in my}} house, and I think {{must have}} known what my {{feelings}} were towards you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But as you say, it is said. He told {{me about}} it, not long afterwards, and I do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dared had there been anything--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To matins?" [...] echoed Dan. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> {{not quite}} <b>have</b> liked her a Catholic; he remembered with relief {{that she had}} said {{she was not a}} Roman Catholic; though when <b>he</b> came to <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> cared a great deal. Nothing could have changed her from being Alice.|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} rise, {{but the effort}} seemed too much for him. I hastened to his aid, or I <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fallen. <b>He</b> leaned on my arm heavily as we passed {{on our way to}} the avenue, where a {{carriage}} was already awaiting us.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are clear-headed fellows, these Scotchmen; {{whether they}} are in our army or Frederick's. What makes the affair more {{wonderful}} {{is that this was}} quite a young fellow, and probably understood no German; but I <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> acted more wisely, had he waited until the spring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{the grace}} to be ashamed," [...] grunted D'Hubert, who had stood {{still for a}} moment. He resumed his pacing while the doctor murmured.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If so, don't you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{let that}} house instead of keeping {{it up in}} empty state! There {{is a good deal}} of {{character}} in those Whites.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great Scott!" [...] {{answered}} her husband. [...] "How {{did you expect}} him to look? Did you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a red nose and a patch over one eye?" ...|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} <b>he</b> hoped <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{so many things}} to <b>think</b> about that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} to trouble about the little son who never came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Consider further," [...] the Marquis continued, [...] "that he {{has taken}} Broomleys and will {{therefore}} be a neighbour of ours for some time. Do you <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done this with the knowledge in his mind he had involved me in a transaction which was destined to have an unfortunate conclusion?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Natalia Victorovich Haldin: The independent-minded {{and sincere}} sister of Victor Haldin, {{she is not}} {{impressed}} by Peter Ivanovitch. She is described as [...] "full-figured" [...] with [...] "trustful eyes". She has a confident manner and a reputation for liberalism. She was educated in an institute for women (women were not easily allowed to study at university) where she was looked upon unfavourably because of her views. Both mother and daughter were later placed under surveillance in their country place. Natalia thinks that by befriending Razumov, she will stay faithful {{to the spirit of}} her brother, as he had described Razumov in his letters as possessing a [...] "lofty, unstained and solitary" [...] existence. She is suspicious of the circumstances of Haldin's capture, as she <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had an escape plan.|$|R
