25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the <b>turns</b> <b>ratio</b> of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high <b>turns</b> <b>ratio</b> transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885. Ottó Bláthy also invented the first AC electricity meter.|$|E
25|$|Strobe lights usually use flashtubes {{with energy}} {{supplied}} from a capacitor, an energy storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high <b>turns</b> <b>ratio.</b> This generates the weak but high voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a direct short circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.|$|E

The antenna's low resistance was increased (transformed) by a factor equal to the square of the <b>turns</b> <b>ratio</b> (the ratio of the number of turns the antenna was connected to, to the total number of turns of the coil), to match the resistance across the tuned circuit.

2500|$|A {{ribbon speaker}} {{consists}} of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal {{is applied to the}} ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little mass; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile—some can be torn by a strong gust of air. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier [...] "sees" [...] a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer <b>turns</b> <b>ratio</b> squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract　In {{various kinds}} of {{electronic}} circuits, transformers are practically utilized, which have been designed or analysed mainly with lumped constant circuit theory. 　In very high speed pulse circuits, however, travelling time within transformer becomes significant. 　Thus the lumped constant theory is no longer adequate for analysis, and transformers must be considered as distributed constant circuits. In some books, a few descriptions can be found about transmission-line pulse transformers. However, those <b>turn</b> <b>ratio</b> is limited to 1 : 1 and those discussions are rather quantative. 　This paper presents a distributed constant circuit theory for transformer of arbitrary <b>turn</b> <b>ratio</b> n: 1, and evaluates the pulse rise-time responses more accurately and regorously than in a lumped constant circuit theory. 　　変成器は種々の電子回路において実用されているが，その設計および解析は主として集中定数回路理諭によってなされている。しかし，ひじょうに高速のパルス回路においては変成器内部の伝搬時問が重要になり，集中定数論はもはや成立しなくなるので分布定数諭で考えなければならなくなる。伝送線路形パルス変成器に関する文献はわづかであり，しかも巻線１：１の場合に限られており，その説明も定性的である。　　本論文は任意の巻線比ｎ：１の変成器に関する分布定数論を提供するものであって，集中定数論におけるよりもさらに正確で厳密なパルス応答の立上り特性を求めている...|$|R

The maximum diversion in both cases is obtained by solving a linear programming problem.
