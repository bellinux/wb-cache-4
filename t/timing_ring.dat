Our results show that a topology preserving behaviour quite {{similar to that of}} Kohonen's self-organizing map can be achieved using temporal coding. In contrast to previous approaches, which use rate coding, the winner among competing neurons can be determined fast and locally. Hence our model is a further step towards a more realistic description of unsupervised learning in biological neural systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Myosin-II (Myo 2 p) and {{tropomyosin}} {{are essential}} for contractile ring formation and cytokinesis in fission yeast. Here we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to understand how these proteins function at contractile rings. We find that ring assembly is delayed in Myo 2 p motor and tropomyosin mutants, but occurs prematurely in cells engineered to express two copies of myo 2. Thus, the <b>timing</b> of <b>ring</b> assembly responds to changes in Myo 2 p cellular levels and motor activity, {{and the emergence of}} tropomyosin-bound actin filaments. Doubling Myo 2 p levels suppresses defects in ring assembly associated with a tropomyosin mutant, suggesting a role for tropomyosin in maximizing Myo 2 p function. Correspondingly, tropomyosin increases Myo 2 p actin affinity and ATPase activity and promotes Myo 2 p-driven actin filament gliding in motility assays. Tropomyosin achieves this by favoring the strong actin-bound state of Myo 2 p. This mode of regulation reflects a role for tropomyosin in specifying and stabilizing actomyosin interactions, which facilitates contractile ring assembly in the fission yeast system...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a scalable and partitionable asynchronous bus arbiter {{for use with}} chip multiprocessors (CMP) and its corresponding pre-layout simulation results using VHDL. The arbiter exploits {{the advantage of a}} concurrency control instruction (Brk) provided by the micro-threaded microprocessor model to set the priority processor and move the circulated arbitration token at the most likely processor to issue the create instruction. This mechanism provides latency hiding during token circulation by decoupling the micro-threaded processor from the <b>ring’s</b> <b>timing.</b> It is shown that this arbiter can be extended easily to support large numbers of processors and can be used for chip multiprocessor arbitration purposes. ...|$|R

40|$|Sub-level caving (SLC) is an {{important}} mass mining method which {{is based upon the}} utilization of gravity flow of waste material and blasted ore. The method function on the principle that ore is fragmented by blasting, while the overlying host rock fractures and caves by the action of mine induced stresses and gravity. The caved rock or debris from the previous blasted rings reduces the fragmentation and the swelling of the blasted ring as it absorbs some of the explosive energy and preventing all energy of the explosive to break the ore. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate a new concept for <b>timing</b> double <b>ring</b> blasts in terms of fragmentation. For this purpose, a series of tests has been made in small-scale SLC blocks. The idea is to blast two rings at the same time, but with a short delay time between the rings. In this case, the second ring will be blasted first which will create a slot between the blasted burden and the remaining rock which will eventually provide a free face for the first ring. This may result in improved fragmentation. Validerat; 20130501 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

Though, understanding the way these spike trains represent the stimuli is still a challenging issue, especially when considering their non-determinism. Interestingly, the spike-based code of the retina is binary-like, and thus we considered its study in a signal coding fashion. To do so, we specied a coding scheme based on the mean ring rate of spikes simulated by a realistic model of the mammalians retina. We, then, inverted the generated code to reconstruct the original input. Besides, we established some links between the processing occurring in the retina and state-of-the art methods in pure image coding.

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe divides using an actomyosin ring and is an attractive organism {{for the study of}} cytokinesis. Recent studies in S. pombe (Wu, J. Q., V. Sirotkin, D. R. Kovar, M. Lord, C. C. Beltzner, J. R. Kuhn, and T. D. Pollard. 2006. J. Cell Biol. 174 : 391 – 402; Vavylonis, D., J. Q. Wu, S. Hao, B. O'Shaughnessy, and T. D. Pollard. 2008. Science. 319 : 97 – 100) have suggested that the assembly of the actomyosin ring is initiated from a series of cortical nodes containing several components of this ring. These studies have proposed that actomyosin interactions bring together the cortical nodes to form a compacted ring structure. In this study, we test this model in cells that are unable to assemble cortical nodes. Although the cortical nodes {{play a role in the}} <b>timing</b> of <b>ring</b> assembly, we find that they are dispensable for the assembly of orthogonal actomyosin rings. Thus, a mechanism that is independent of cortical nodes is sufficient for the assembly of normal actomyosin rings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Various {{researchers}} have proposed using self-timed networks to generate and distribute clocks and other timing signals. We consider {{one of the}} simplest self-timed networks, a ring, and note that for <b>timing</b> applications, self-timed <b>rings</b> should maintain uniform spacing of events. In practice, all previous designs {{of which we are}} aware cluster events into bursts. In this paper, we describe a dynamical systems approach to verify the temporal properties of self-timed rings. With these methods, we can verify that a new design has the desired uniform spacing of events. The key to our methods is developing an appropriate model of the timing behaviour of our circuits. Our model is more accurate than the simplistic interval bounds of timed-automata techniques, while providing a higher level of abstraction than non-linear differential equation models such as SPICE. Evenly spaced and clustered event behaviours are distinguished by simple geometric features of our model. ...|$|R
40|$|The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe divides by medial fission {{through the}} use of an {{actomyosin}} contractile ring. Precisely at the end of anaphase, the ring begins to constrict and the septum forms. Proper coordination of cell division with mitosis is crucial to ensure proper segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells. The Sid 2 p kinase is one of several proteins that function as part of a novel signaling pathway required for initiation of medial ring constriction and septation. Here, we show that Sid 2 p is a component of the spindle pole body at all stages of the cell cycle and localizes transiently to the cell division site during medial ring constriction and septation. A medial ring and an intact microtubule cytoskeleton are required for the localization of Sid 2 p to the division site. We have established an in vitro assay for measuring Sid 2 p kinase activity, and found that Sid 2 p kinase activity peaks during medial ring constriction and septation. Both Sid 2 p localization to the division site and activity depend on the function of all of the other septation initiation genes: cdc 7, cdc 11, cdc 14, sid 1, spg 1, and sid 4. Thus, Sid 2 p, a component of the spindle pole body, by virtue of its transient localization to the division site, appears to determine the <b>timing</b> of <b>ring</b> constriction and septum delivery in response to activating signals from other Sid gene products...|$|R
40|$|The {{sectioned}} otoliths of four {{fish species}} from a tropical demersal trawl fishery in Western Australia revealed {{a series of}} alternating trans-lucent and opaque zones in reflected light. The translucent zones, referred to as growth rings, were counted to determine fish ages. The width of the opaque zone {{on the periphery of}} the otolith section as a proportion of the width of the previous opaque zone (index of completion) was used to determine the periodicity of growth-ring formation. This article describes a method for modeling changes in the index of ring completion over time, from which a parameter for the most probable time of growth-ring formation (with confidence intervals) can be determined. The parameter estimate for the timing of new growth-ring formation for Lethrinus sp. 3 was from mid July to mid September, for Lutjanus vitta from early July to the end of August, for Nemipterus furcosus from mid July to late September, and for Lutjanus sebae from mid July to mid November. The confidence intervals for the timing of formation of growth rings was variable between species, being smallest for L. vitta, and variable between fish of the same species with different numbers of growth rings. The stock assessments of these commercially important species relies on aging information for all the age classes used in the assessment. This study demonstrated that growth rings on sectioned otoliths were laid down annually, irrespective of the number of growth rings, and also demonstrated that the <b>timing</b> of <b>ring</b> formation for these tropical species can be determined quantitatively (with confidence intervals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The mitotic exit network (MEN) is {{required}} for events {{at the end of}} mitosis such as degradation of mitotic cyclins and cytokinesis. Bub 2 and its binding partner Bfa 1 act as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) to negatively regulate the MEN GTPase Tem 1. The Bub 2 /Bfa 1 checkpoint pathway {{is required}} to delay the cell cycle in response to mispositioned spindles. In addition to its role in mitotic exit, Tem 1 {{is required for}} actomyosin ring contraction. Results To test the hypothesis that the Bub 2 pathway prevents premature actin ring assembly, we compared the <b>timing</b> of actin <b>ring</b> formation in wild type, bub 2 Δ, mad 2 Δ, and bub 2 Δmad 2 Δ cells both with and without microtubules. There was no difference in the <b>timing</b> of actin <b>ring</b> formation between wild type and mutant cells in a synchronized cell cycle. In the presence of nocodazole, both bub 2 Δ and mad 2 Δ cells formed rings after a delay of the same duration. Double mutant bub 2 Δmad 2 Δ and bfa 1 Δmad 2 Δ cells formed rings at the same time with and without nocodazole. To determine if Bub 2 has an effect on actomyosin ring contraction through its regulation of Tem 1, we used live cell imaging of Myo 1 -GFP in a bub 2 Δ strain. We found a significant decrease in the total time of contraction and an increase in rate of contraction compared to wild type cells. We also examined myosin contraction using Myo 1 -GFP in cells overexpressing an epitope tagged Bub 2. Surprisingly, overexpression of Bub 2 also led to {{a significant increase in the}} rate of contraction, as well as morphological defects. The chained cell phenotype caused by Bub 2 overexpression could be rescued by co-overexpression of Tem 1, and was not rescued by deletion of BFA 1. Conclusion Our data indicate that the Bub 2 checkpoint pathway does not have a specific role in delaying actin ring formation. The observed increase in the rate of myosin contraction in the bub 2 Δ strain provides evidence that the MEN regulates actomyosin ring contraction. Our data suggest that the overexpression of the Bub 2 fusion protein acts as a dominant negative, leading to septation defects by a mechanism that is Tem 1 -dependent. </p...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the life}} {{history of a}} species is {{essential}} for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. This study describes the age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida waters: blackfin tuna Thunnus atlanticus, little tunny Euthynnus alletteratus, and skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis. Tuna specimens were collected via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains {{in the areas of}} the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line by the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center. Age was described via sagittal otolith deposition patterns. They were removed, dried, sectioned, and rings were counted as well as measured. Validation of the <b>timing</b> of <b>ring</b> deposits was done by marginal increment analysis. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of fish fork length to count measurements. This comparison via the Von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin, L∞ = 95. 34 cm, K = 0. 28, and t 0 = - 1. 53; little tunny, L∞ = 77. 93 cm, K = 0. 69, and t 0 = - 0. 69; and skipjack, L∞ = 112. 76 cm, K = 0. 24, and t 0 = - 1. 70. The curves indicate an average size of an individual of a given species at a certain age. They also give an estimation of a maximum length (L∞) of each species, in addition to specific growth rate, which is indicated by the slope. Parameters of each resulting Von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species.

40|$|The oceans around {{southern}} Africa form {{a unique}} system, impacting the regional and global climate [1]. From the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean vigorous interoceanic exchange of warm and saline waters takes {{place that is}} subject to a complicated interplay between local dynamics and global embedment. Central element of the circulation around South Africa is the Agulhas Current [2] that flows poleward along the east coast, closely bound to the shelf at first, and subsequently overshoots {{the southern tip of}} Africa to abruptly turn back into the Indian Ocean. Part of the warm and saline waters with tropical Indian Ocean origin, the “Agulhas leakage” [3], flows into the Atlantic and forms the surface return flow of the global thermohaline circulation towards the North Atlantic [4]. The exchange takes place in a highly nonlinear manner, with mesoscale eddies being separated from the retroflecting Agulhas Current, which then strongly interact in the Cape Basin [5]. West of the Cape Basin, large Agulhas rings that have been formed [6] transport the anomalous warm and saline waters into the South Atlantic. In addition to its own dynamics, the Agulhas Current system is influenced by nonlinearities in the source regions: mesoscale eddies originating from the Mozambique Channel and east of Madagascar [7, 8] drift southward and cause the Agulhas Current to be displaced offshore of its mean position by more than 100 km.

40|$|Chromosome {{replication}} {{and cell}} division of Escherichia coli are coordinated with growth such that wild-type cells divide once and only once after each replication cycle. To investigate {{the nature of}} this coordination, the effects of inhibiting replication on Z-ring formation and cell division were tested in both synchronized and exponentially growing cells with only one replicating chromosome. When replication elongation was blocked by hydroxyurea or nalidixic acid, arrested cells contained one partially replicated, compact nucleoid located mid-cell. Cell division was strongly inhibited at or before the level of Z-ring formation. DNA cross-linking by mitomycin C delayed segregation, and the accumulation of about two chromosome equivalents at mid-cell also blocked Z-ring formation and cell division. Z-ring inhibition occurred independently of SOS, SlmA-mediated nucleoid oc-clusion, andMinCDE proteins and did not result from a decreased FtsZ protein concentration. We propose that the presence of a compact, incompletely replicated nucleoid or unsegregated chromosomemasses at the normal mid-cell division site inhibits Z-ring formation and that the SOS system, SlmA, andMinC are not required for this inhibition. Bacterial DNA replication and cell division are coordinatedwith growth so that a single, timely division follows each ge-nome duplication. This rule, however, is {{complicated by the fact that}} cells can divide rapidly, with the replication and division ma-chinery operating continuously and concurrently (e. g., see refer-ence 1). Division at mid-cell, which occurs with high precision (2, 3), begins with polymerization of the FtsZ protein into a circum-ferential ring on the cytoplasmic membrane inner surface (4). Although division frequency is ultimately determined by growth rate (5, 6), regulatory mechanisms control both the location and <b>timing</b> of FtsZ <b>ring</b> assembly (for recent reviews, see the works of de Boer [7], Chien et al.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engines are}} one of the most {{promising}} engine technologies for the future of energy conversion from clean, efficient combustion. HCCI engines allow high efficiency and lower CO 2 emission through the use of high compression ratios and the removal of intake throttle valves (like Diesel), and allow very low levels of urban pollutants like nitric oxide and soot (like Otto). These engines, however, are not without their challenges, such as low power density compared with other engine technologies, and a difficulty in controlling combustion timing. This dissertation first addresses the power output limits. The particular strategies for enabling high power output investigated in this dissertation focus on avoiding five critical limits that either damage an engine, drastically reduce efficiency, or drastically increase emissions: 1) ringing limits, 2) peak in-cylinder pressure limits, 3) misfire limits, 4) low intake temperature limits, and 5) excessive emissions limits. The research shows that the key factors that enable high power output, sufficient for passenger vehicles, while simultaneously avoiding the five limits defined above are the use of: 1) high intake air pressures allowing improved power output, 2) highly delayed combustion <b>timing</b> to avoid <b>ringing</b> limits, and 3) using the highest possible equivalence ratio before encountering ringing limits. These results are revealed by conducting extensive experiments spanning a wide range of operating conditions on a multi-cylinder HCCI engine. Second, this dissertation discusses strategies for effectively sensing combustion characteristics on a HCCI engine. For effective feedback control of HCCI combustion timing, a sensor is required to quantify when combustion occurs. Many laboratory engines use in-cylinder pressure sensors but these sensors are currently prohibitively expensive for wide-scale commercialization. Instead, ion sensors made from inexpensive sparkplugs are proposed for sensing combustion timing. Ion sensing, however, is unreliable under certain HCCI conditions. The dissertation presents two strategies for improving the usefulness of ion sensors in HCCI engines: 1) the use of tiny fractions of metal-acetate fuel additives that expand the useful range of ion sensors, and 2) the use of ion sensors for detecting excessive ringing that must be avoided in HCCI engines. These two innovative research efforts make ion sensors viable for sensing combustion characteristics across the full range of HCCI operation, making them effective for use in engine control systems. In summary, this Ph. D dissertation addresses two important technical challenges facing HCCI engines: power output limits, and difficulty in sensing combustion characteristics for control applications. The strategies proposed in this dissertation research bring HCCI engines closer to widespread commercialization allowing vehicles to operate with significantly higher efficiency and with cleaner emissions...|$|R
