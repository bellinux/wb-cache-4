25|$|The {{evolution}} of flight {{is one of}} the most striking and demanding in animal evolution, and has attracted the attention of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend <b>to</b> <b>fossilize</b> infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, it can be difficult to discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{are only}} rarely {{preserved}} as fossils {{in the best}} of circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. This is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record is less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived. Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure <b>to</b> <b>fossilize,</b> only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only a snapshot of the process of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which will never demonstrate an exact half-way point.|$|E

"There {{have been}} some {{important}} revivals in religion; for the world won't stand still, and we must keep pace or be left behind <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> A free nation must have a religion broad enough to embrace all mankind, deep enough to fathom and fill the human soul, high enough to reach {{the source of all}} love and wisdom, and pure enough to satisfy the wisest and the best. Alarm bells have been rung, anathemas pronounced, and Christians, forgetful of their creed, have abused one another heartily. But the truth always triumphs in the end, and whoever sincerely believes, works and waits for it, by whatever name he calls it, will surely find his own faith blessed to him in proportion to his charity for the faith of others.|$|E
50|$|Mesozoic strata {{are largely}} absent in New York. Nevertheless, {{evidence}} suggests that during the Triassic the geologic forces responsible for the breakup of Pangaea formed rift basins in the state. Dinosaur footprints of the ichnogenus Grallator were left behind <b>to</b> <b>fossilize</b> in Nyack Beach State Park of Haverstraw during the Late Triassic. Other kinds of reptiles contemporary with the dinosaurian trackmakers left behind their own footprints <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> During the ensuing Jurassic, rift basin formation continued in the state as Pangea divided.|$|E

50|$|Styletoctopus is an extinct genus of octopus. The genus {{consists}} of the single species Styletoctopus annae, which lived approximately 95 million years ago. Very few octopus species appear in the fossil record, as octopuses consist of soft tissue that usually decomposes before it has time <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b>|$|E

50|$|Benthic diatoms are the {{dominate}} type of siliceous algae {{found in}} the beds. These are easy <b>to</b> <b>fossilize</b> due to their silica shells.

2500|$|Microfossil is a {{descriptive}} term applied <b>to</b> <b>fossilized</b> {{plants and animals}} whose size is just at or below {{the level at which}} the fossil can be analyzed by the naked eye. A commonly applied cutoff point between [...] "micro" [...] and [...] "macro" [...] fossils is 1mm. Microfossils may either be complete (or near-complete) organisms in themselves (such as the marine plankters foraminifera and coccolithophores) or component parts (such as small teeth or spores) of larger animals or plants. Microfossils are of critical importance as a reservoir of paleoclimate information, and are also commonly used by biostratigraphers to assist in the correlation of rock units.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the most}} visited springs today are Geyser Island Spouter and Orenda Spring, along Geyser Creek. Geyser Island Spouter, which sends a narrow plume of water 10 to 15 ft into the air, first emerged in the early 1900s. Since that time, it has {{deposited}} minerals that grow a tufa deposit {{at the rate of}} 2 in per year. Orenda Spring has created a massive tufa dome, which continues <b>to</b> <b>fossilize</b> leaves and other debris as it grows.|$|E
5000|$|In {{large enough}} quantities, the minute shells of these {{bivalves}} can affect environmental conditions, and {{this change in}} conditions can positively affect the ability of organic remains in the immediate environment <b>to</b> <b>fossilize</b> (one aspect of taphonomy). For example, in the Dinosaur Park Formation, the fossil remains of hadrosaur eggshells are rare. This is because the breakdown of tannins from the local coniferous vegetation caused the ancient waters to be acidic, and therefore usually eggshell fragments dissolved in the water before {{they had a chance}} to be fossilized.|$|E
50|$|Cephalopod egg fossils are the fossilized {{remains of}} eggs laid by {{cephalopod}}s. The fossil record of cephalopod eggs is scant since their soft, gelatinous eggs decompose quickly and have little chance <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> Eggs laid by ammonoids {{are the best}} known {{and only a few}} putative examples of these have been discovered. The best preserved of these were discovered in the Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay of England. Currently no belemnoid egg fossils have ever been discovered although this may be because scientists have not properly searched for them rather than an actual absence from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets <b>to</b> be <b>fossilized</b> since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} extremely rare.|$|R

50|$|Callao man refers <b>to</b> <b>fossilized</b> remains {{discovered}} inside Callao Cave in 2007 by Armand Salvador Mijares. Specifically, {{the find}} {{consisted of a}} single 61 mm metatarsal which, when dated using uranium series ablation, {{was found to be}} at least about 67,000 years old. If definitively proven to be remains of Homo sapiens, it would antedate the 47,000-year-old remains of Tabon Man to become the earliest human remains known in the Philippines, and one of the oldest human remains in the Asia Pacific. It has been noted by researchers that Callao Man was probably under four feet tall. Researchers also believe that Aetas, mountain dwellers today on Luzon Island, could be descendants of the Callao Man.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} explain this. Workers have attempted to discover: 1) why fossilization occurs, 2) the precipitating conditions, 3) what kind of linguistic material {{is likely to be}} fossilized, and 4) what type of learners are more prone <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> However, there has been almost no investigation by SLA theorists on the possibilities of preventing or overcoming fossilization, and little explanation related to those adult second language learners who overcome one or more [...] "areas of stability" [...] in interlanguage—those learners whose interlanguage does not fossilize, and who reach a high level of proficiency in the second language.|$|E
50|$|Eggs laid by {{invertebrate}} {{animals are}} {{known from the}} fossil record. Among these are eggs laid by ancient cephalopods. Eggs laid by ammonoids are the best known cephalopod egg fossils. The best preserved fossil ammonite eggs were preserved in the Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay of England. Nevertheless, the fossil record of cephalopod eggs is scant since their soft, gelatinous eggs decompose quickly and have little chance <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> Another major group of Mesozoic cephalopods, the belemnoids, have no documented eggs in the fossil record whatsoever, although {{this may be because}} scientists have not properly searched for them rather than an actual absence from the fossil record.|$|E
50|$|In {{large enough}} quantities, unionid shells can {{have enough of}} an impact on {{environmental}} conditions to affect the ability of organic remains in the local environment <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> For example, in the Dinosaur Park Formation, fossil hadrosaur eggshell is rare because the breakdown of tannins from local coniferous vegetation would have caused the ancient waters to become acidic. Eggshell fragments are present in only two microfossil sites, {{both of which are}} dominated by the preserved shells of invertebrate life, including unionids. The slow dissolution of these shells releasing calcium carbonate into the water raised the water's pH high enough to prevent the eggshell fragments from dissolving before they could be fossilized.|$|E

50|$|In fact, the Malacostracan has a {{well-documented}} fossil record, that, although patchy {{or missing}} entirely (ghost lineage) for certain clades, offer {{a unique opportunity}} to analyse the morphology of the ancestral taxa of a clade or a dead-end sister taxa (plesion), whose age (determined by its stratigraphy) gives an estimate of how long has a group been around. However, the major limitation <b>to</b> <b>fossilized</b> samples is that typically the soft parts do not fossilize and are therefore lost, as a consequence a much more limited amount of information that can be gathered. Furthermore, some taxa may not fossilize well, and therefore leave no trace even though they existed, when this occurs in the fossil record, the period where the taxa are expected to appear is called a ghost range.|$|R
50|$|In {{large enough}} quantities, {{gastropod}} shells can {{have enough of}} an impact on environmental conditions to affect the ability of organic remains in the local environment <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> For example, in the Dinosaur Park Formation, fossil hadrosaur eggshell is rare. This is because the breakdown of tannins from local coniferous vegetation would have caused the ancient waters to become acidic. Eggshell fragments are present in only two microfossil sites, {{both of which are}} predominated by the preserved shells of invertebrate life, including gastropods. It was the slow dissolution of these shells releasing calcium carbonate into the water that raised the water's pH high enough to prevent the eggshell fragments from dissolving before they could be fossilized.|$|E
50|$|Keuppia is an extinct genus of octopus. It {{consists}} of two species, Keuppia hyperbolaris and Keuppia levante, both of which lived approximately 95 million years ago. Both species were found in fossilized form, which is very uncommon for extinct octopuses, as the soft tissue of dead octopuses almost always disintegrates before it has a chance <b>to</b> <b>fossilize.</b> These fossils, {{along with those of}} the genus Styletoctopus, were found from the Cretaceous-age Hâqel and Hâdjoula localities in Lebanon. The presence of a gladius vestige in this genus shows a transition from squid to octopus in which the inner shell has divided in two in early forms to eventually be reduced to lateralized stylets, {{as can be seen in}} Styletoctopus.|$|E
5000|$|Bottosaurus is an extinct genus of crocodile. Specimens {{have been}} found from New Jersey, North and South Carolina, and Colorado. It had distinctively thick osteoderms that lacked the pitting of most other crocodylians. The unusual blunt, conical tribodontid {{crushing}} teeth {{are the most common}} diagnostic material <b>to</b> <b>fossilize</b> and be recovered, although teeth from the posterior portion of the jaw tend to be more laterally compressed like those of other related crocodiles. The teeth had a [...] "wrinkled" [...] enamel surface and prominent annual rings with vertical ridges running down them. A short, massive lower jaw that is nearly circular in cross-section is evident from remains of the type species B. harlani.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} publication described {{little in}} the way of diagnostic characteristics and was only supported by a few line drawings. This has led to speculation that the bones might actually be petrified wood, akin to the way the original discoverers of Sauroposeidon initially believed their find <b>to</b> be <b>fossilized</b> tree trunks.|$|R
5000|$|The genus name {{is derived}} from the name of the Huari people, an ancient culture from Peru, and from the Latin word for [...] "dolphin"; delphis.
