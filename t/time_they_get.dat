5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively {{accepting}} a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite {{that the two}} have only {{known each other for}} a short <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>get</b> married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|Batman, Robin and Batgirl {{decide to}} go after Freeze together. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to the {{observatory}} where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane. They eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him {{over the death of}} wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E

50|$|However, it {{is similar}} to the {{basketball}} game H-O-R-S-E- in the sense that a player must hit the ball to a target area of the field, or <b>they</b> <b>get</b> a letter of the word horse. <b>They</b> must <b>get</b> as many points as they can before <b>they</b> miss five <b>times.</b> <b>They</b> <b>get</b> bonus points for hitting the ball further, and are eliminated when they spell out the word horse.|$|R

Lum develops a fan base of admirers among the boys of the school, including Shutaro Mendou, the rich and handsome heir to a large corporation that all the girls from Tomobiki have a crush on. Despite their romantic interest, none of Lum's admirers will risk upsetting Lum by trying to force her and Ataru apart, although this doesn't stop them from trying to get Ataru punished due to his bad behavior, and interfering every <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> close to him.|$|E
25|$|Catherine Chandler, a law student, {{witnesses}} {{her mother}} being shot {{the same night}} she is saved from her mother's murderers by a supposed beast. Nine years later, and now working as a detective for the NYPD, a case leads her to discover that Vincent Keller, an ex-soldier {{believed to have been}} killed in action during military service, is actually alive. As Catherine gets to know him, she starts finding out more about her mother's murder and about who (and what) Vincent really is. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to know one another and eventually fall in love.|$|E
25|$|Hero Points allow {{characters}} {{to perform the}} unlikely or cinematic stunts from the genre. Characters earn a Hero Point every <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> a Quality 1 result on a skill other than combat, also when the GM chooses to award one for a clever or dramatic action. A Hero Point may be spent to change the Quality Rating of any result by one level, whether for or against the character, also to change the environment, such as having something just show up by coincidence - the more fantastic, the more expensive in terms of Hero Points.|$|E

25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, the All-China Women's Federation {{posted a}} {{controversial}} article titled 'Leftover Women Do Not Deserve Our Sympathy' shortly after International Women's Day. An excerpt states, [...] "Pretty girls {{do not need}} a lot of education to marry into a rich and powerful family. But girls with an average or ugly appearance will find it difficult" [...] and [...] "These girls hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is, they don't realise that as women age, they are worth less and less. So by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> their MA or PhD, they are already old â€” like yellowed pearls." [...] Originally at least 15 articles were available on its website relating to the subject of sheng nu, which have now been subsequently removed, that included matchmaking advice and tips.|$|E
500|$|During game six, Valeri Kharlamov was {{targeted}} by Team Canada for attention. According to Conacher, [...] "every <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> a chance, they're taking {{him for a}} rough ride along the boards." [...] Kharlamov {{was the target of}} numerous bodychecks by Brad Park. Things started to heat up in the second period. Kharlamov had knocked down Bobby Clarke, who in retaliation, rubbed Kharlamov's face with his glove to raise Kharlamov's temper and the two exchanged punches. Bergman then stepped in and bumped into Kharlamov and harassed him {{all the way back to}} the bench. Peter Mahovlich later elbowed Kharlamov, who retaliated by dumping Mahovlich to the ice. Later, Clarke raced down the ice to catch a streaking Kharlamov and deliberately slashed Kharlamov's already sore ankle, injuring it and according to reports, fracturing it. Kharlamov skated over to the Canadian bench and yelled at the Canadians, before limping off the ice to the dressing room. The referees handed Clarke a minor penalty for slashing and an additional 10-minute misconduct penalty. Later, with Clarke still stuck in the box serving the misconduct, the referees also gave Dennis Hull a slashing penalty, during which Yakushev scored. On his injured ankle, Kharlamov returned to play and very nearly scored on Dryden during a power play later in the second period.|$|E

6000|$|There is one paper {{published}} {{here in the}} English language--The Levant Herald--and {{there are}} generally a number of Greek and a few French papers rising and falling, struggling up and falling again. Newspapers are not popular with the Sultan's Government. They do not understand journalism. The proverb says, [...] "The unknown is always great." [...] To the court, the newspaper is a mysterious and rascally institution. They know what a pestilence is, because they have one occasionally that thins the people out {{at the rate of}} two thousand a day, and they regard a newspaper as a mild form of pestilence. When it goes astray, they suppress it--pounce upon it without warning, and throttle it. When it don't go astray for a long <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> suspicious and throttle it anyhow, because they think it is hatching deviltry. Imagine the Grand Vizier in solemn council with the magnates of the realm, spelling his way through the hated newspaper, and finally delivering his profound decision: [...] "This thing means mischief --it is too darkly, too suspiciously inoffensive--suppress it!

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren, {{her eyes}} twinkling, [...] "I wouldn't {{advise you to}} run across the Green Meadows in sight of King Eagle. I am told he is very fond of Rabbit. In fact he is very fond of fresh meat of any kind. He even catches the babies of Lightfoot the Deer when he gets a chance. He is so swift of wing that even {{the members of the}} Duck family fear him, for he is especially fond of fat Duck. Even Honker the Goose is not safe from him. King he may he, but he rules only through fear. He is a white-headed old robber. The best thing I can say of him is that he takes a mate for life and is loyal and true to her as long as she lives, and that is a great many years. By the way, Peter, did you know that she is bigger than he is, and that the young during the first year after leaving their nest, are bigger than their parents and do not have white heads?

6000|$|Yes, {{there they}} sit; and others, perhaps, besides Fitz have cast a sheep's-eye through those {{enormous}} plate-glass windowpanes. I {{suppose it is}} the fact of perpetually living among such a quantity of good things that makes those young ladies so beautiful. They come into the place, let us say, like ordinary people, and gradually grow handsomer and handsomer, until they grow out into the perfect angels you see. It can't be otherwise: if you and I, my dear fellow, were to have a course of that place, we should become beautiful too. They live {{in an atmosphere of}} the most delicious pine-apples, blanc-manges, creams, (some whipt, and some so good that of course they don't want whipping,) jellies, tipsy-cakes, cherry-brandy--one hundred thousand sweet and lovely things. Look at the preserved fruits, look at the golden ginger, the outspreading ananas, the darling little rogues of China oranges, ranged in the gleaming crystal cylinders. Mon Dieu! Look at the strawberries in the leaves. Each of them is as large nearly as a lady's reticule, and looks {{as if it had been}} brought up in a nursery to itself. One of those strawberries is a meal for those young ladies, behind the counter; they nibble off a little from the side, and if they are very hungry, which can scarcely ever happen, they are allowed to go to the crystal canisters and take out a rout-cake or macaroon. In the evening they sit and tell each other little riddles out of the bonbons; and when they wish to amuse themselves, they read the most delightful remarks, in the French language, about Love, and Cupid, and Beauty, before they place them inside the crackers. They always are writing down good things into Mr. Fubsby's ledgers. It must be a perfect feast to read them. Talk of the Garden of Eden! I believe it was nothing to Mr. Fubsby's house; and I have no doubt that after those young ladies have been there a certain <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to such a pitch of loveliness at last, that they become complete angels, with wings sprouting out of their lovely shoulders, when (after giving just a preparatory balance or two) they fly up to the counter and perch there for a minute, hop down again, and affectionately kiss the other young ladies, and say, [...] "Good-by, dears! We shall meet again la haut." [...] And then with a whir of their deliciously scented wings, away they fly for good, whisking over the trees of Brobdingnag Square, and up into the sky, as the policeman touches his hat.|$|E
