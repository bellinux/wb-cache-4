Many ionic liquids such as [C 4 min][PF 6], [C 8 mim][PF 6], [C 4 min][bistrifluromethane sulflonimide], [C 4 min][BF 4], [C 8 mim][BF 4], and [C 4 min][bistrifluromethane sulflonimide] were synthesized and characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), viscometry, and some other methods. Properties such as decomposition temperature, melting point, viscosity, density, heat capacity, and thermal expansion coefficient were measured. The calculated storage density for [C 8 mim][PF 6] is 378 MJ/m 3 when the inlet and outlet field temperatures are 210 o C and 390 o C.

As a consequence TSCs have a potentially important role in meeting future carbon reduction goals. This research has produced a comprehensive numerical model for TSCs based on Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analyses. The model allows parametric studies of key variables and is differentiated from previous models in that it takes full account of factors such as: wind speed and direction, non-uniform flow, turbulent flow, solar radiation intensity, sun position and flow suction rates. It comprises a full size section of cassette-panel TSC that can be easily morphed to reflect a wide range of geometries. A multi-block meshing approach has been employed to reduce grid size and to also resolve jet flows and boundary layers taking place in the plenum and around the absorber plate. Accuracy of the CFD model has been validated against experimental data. Modeling demonstrated that factors such as wind angle have unexpectedly significant adverse effects on system thermal performance. The studies also furthered understanding of key performance attributes including the effects of suction ratio in terms of optimising performance, and the relationship between sun angle and system operating temperature (important for effective operation of heat storage systems).

40|$|Inorganic salts {{are very}} {{promising}} as high-temperature heat transfer fluids and <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> in {{solar thermal power}} production. The dual-tank molten salt storage system, for example, has been demonstrated to be effective for continuous operation in solar power tower plants. In this particular storage regime, however, much of the thermal storage potential of the salts is ignored. Most inorganic salts are characterized by high heats of fusion, so their use as phase-change materials (PCMs) allows for substantially higher energy storage density than their use as sensible heat storage alone. For instance, use of molten sodium-potassium eutectic salt over a temperature range of 260 to 560 °C (the approximate operating parameters of a proposed utility-scale storage system) allows for a volumetric energy storage density of 212 kWhth/m 3, whereas the use of pure sodium nitrate (T_m = 307 °C) over the same temperature range (utilizing both sensible and latent heat) yields a storage density of 347 kWhth/m 3. The main downside to these media is their relatively low thermal conductivity (typically {{on the order of}} 1 W/m-K). While low conductivity is not as much an issue with heat transfer fluids, which, owing to convective heat transfer, are not as reliant on conduction as a heat transfer mode, it can become important for PCM storage strategies, in which transient charging behavior will necessarily involve heating the solid-phase material up to and through the process of melting. This investigation seeks to develop new methods of improving heat transfer in inorganic salt latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) media, such as sodium / potassium nitrates and chlorides. These methods include two basic strategies: first, inclusion of conductivity-enhancing additives, and second, incorporation of infrared absorptive additives in otherwise transparent media. Also, in the process, a group of chloride based salts for use as sensible storage media and/or heat transfer fluids has been developed, based on relevant cost and thermophysical properties data. For direct conductivity enhancement, the idea is simple: a PCM with low conductivity can be enhanced by incorporation of nanoparticulate additives at low concentration (5 wt...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolid ceramic {{particles}} {{have proven}} to be an effective heat transfer and <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> for central receiver power production for a heat input temperature up to 1000 °C. In the directly illuminated solid particle receiver, a cascade of ∼ 0. 1 - 1 mm diameter particles is directly heated within a receiver cavity by concentrated solar energy. The efficiency of this approach, with respect to the energy balance on the receiver itself, is dependent on the physical properties of the particles. In this work, the radiative properties, solar weighted absorptance and thermal emittance, have been measured for several commercially available particle candidates both in the as-received state and after thermal exposure to simulate extended operation at elevated temperature in air between 700 ∘C- 1000 ∘C. Heating the particles is shown to significantly reduce the solar weighted absorptance of as-received particles within 24 hours of exposure to air at 1000 °C, while heating at 700 °C in air has relatively little effect. In the as-received state, solar weighted absorptance can be as high as 93 %, dropping to 84 % after 192 hours at 1000 ∘C. Particle stability is better at 700 ∘C, and the solar absorptance remains above 92 % after 192 hours of exposure. Analysis using x-ray diffraction (XRD) shows evidence of multiple chemical transformations in the sintered bauxite particle materials, which contain oxides of aluminum, silicon, titanium, and iron, following heating in air. However, the XRD spectra show only small differences between as-received and heat treated particles leaving open the possibility that the observed change in radiative properties results from a change in oxidation state without a concomitant phase change. Regardless of the specific degradation mechanism, t he solar weighted absorptance of the particles can be increased beyond the as-received condition by chemically reducing the particles in forming gas (5 %H 2 in N 2 or Ar) above 700 °C, providing a possible means of periodically rejuvenating degraded particles in situ...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Instantaneous {{availability}} {{of power is}} taken for granted {{in much of the}} developed world. Provided a fuel source is unlimited and readily available, the expectation of instant power is readily fulfilled with available technology. However, it is now accepted that human kind’s most utilised fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) are in fact diminishing and their availability cannot be guaranteed as demand outstrips supply. Not only supply limitations exist, the burning of these fuels contributes heavily to dangerous climate change. Thus technology needs to be developed to efficiently utilise fuels intermittently or take advantage of other energy sources which may also be intermittent. Thermal energy storage devices store heat energy through sensible heating, a phase change or a combination of the two. A device can be coupled to a power cycle to provide thermal inertia to the system. Power cycles that generate electricity from an intermittent heat source are an obvious application. Applications also exist in industrial processes requiring continuous heat for drying or a chemical reaction and control of air temperature in sensitive environments. Many thermal energy storage devices exist, tailored to particular temperature ranges and storage capacities. This thesis introduces the Miscibility Gap Alloy as a potential thermal storage technology. Miscibility Gap Alloys overcome a number of the shortcomings of molten salt, paraffin and sensible storage media but their properties are not yet well communicated. Material properties, lifetime estimates, economic characteristics and implementations of Miscibility Gap Alloys are discussed in this dissertation. Through analysis of these aspects a number of novel methodologies, theories and devices were developed. The Lattice Monte Carlo method was successfully employed to model effective conductivity of binary composites. The results of these analyses and existing homogenisation models were generalised for volume fraction and constituent conductivity ratio through a novel concept titled ‘microstructural efficiency’. This work enabled the effective thermal conductivity (and indeed any 2 nd rank tensor property obeying Fick’s Law) to be estimated with great accuracy for a number of idealised and common morphologies with generality in volume fraction and conductivity ratio of constituents. Best practice manufacturing methods for different Miscibility Gap Alloys were identified through experiment and presented. This led to knowledge of the morphology of the materials (including potential porosity). From this, good estimates were made of all material properties relevant to the alloys use as thermal storage. The hypothesised material property advantages of Miscibility Gap Alloys are thus confirmed and compared with the existing state of the art. A discussion of the long term behaviour of Miscibility Gap Alloys follows. Consideration is given to diffusion as well as mechanical and chemical dominated aging mechanisms. It was found that diffusion dominated aging is most likely for systems with non-negligible solubility of the components and where discrete large powders undergo large temperature changes through cycling. Mechanical effects should not contribute beyond the first few cycles as the matrix deforms to accommodate any mismatch in thermal expansion. Chemical aging is likely for systems exposed to air or water but may be mitigated through isolation of the material. Establishment of material and long term properties of the alloys enables a discussion of the comparative economics of using Miscibility Gap Alloys as thermal storage. The alloys are shown to be extremely competitive compared to existing thermal energy storage solutions. They have a higher capital cost generally, due to the high cost of metals. However, the infrastructure and maintenance costs required are a fraction of that for most other <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> Finally a number of potential implementations are introduced ranging from thermal inertia for power production to heating for the drying of foods. Detailed calculations and engineering drawings are provided for an air heater device intended for room heating. Specific methods of storage for concentrated solar thermal plants are described before more exotic implementations are presented. The thesis concludes with a summary of work and a critical evaluation of the potential of Miscibility Gap Alloys as <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> Potential work for future research is provided with guidance as to how it might be initiated...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{suitable}} {{materials for}} energy stores for stationary applications, specifically a prototype hydrogen store, domestic thermal store operating between 25 - 100 C and a moderate thermal store for a {{concentrated solar power}} (CSP) plant operating at 400 C. The approach incorporated a unique coating technique to deliver prototype hydrogen and <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media,</b> where the coating could offer commercial advantages, for example, {{in the form of}} hydride activation and enhanced kinetics during successive cycling. The highly reversible Mg-MgH 2 system is particularly promising for thermal storage, obtaining an enthalpy of reaction of 74. 5 kJ/mol H 2 that translates to a thermal energy capacity of approximately 2800 kJ/kg of MgH 2. Nevertheless, magnesium is hindered by slow activation and poor kinetics of (de) hydrogenation, even when approaching temperatures ideal for concentrated solar power applications (in the region 400 C). Elevated temperature cycling studies were performed on commercial atomised Mg powder with magnetron sputtered catalysts (chromium, iron, vanadium and stainless steel) applied to their surfaces; the aim of which was to fabricate hydrogen storage materials that possess (de) hydrogenation characteristics equal to or even bettering their nanocrystalline equivalents, yet in a potentially economic and scalable manner. Following 50 cycles at 400 C, the coatings were found to have little to no positive impact on the behaviour of the atomised Mg powders. In addition, for both uncoated and coated samples the effects of an activation process at 400 C are matched by cycling the material 5 times from the outset, after which identical behaviour is observed during subsequent cycles. At 350 C, the benefits of catalyst coatings on the hydrogen storage properties of atomised Mg powders are evident during activation and successive cycling up to 90 times. The material undergoes different microstructural evolution during cycling when {{in the presence of a}} surface catalyst, causing an enhancement of the `nucleation and growth' stage of (de) hydrogenation. This was attributed to particle reorientation dominating particle sintering, whereas the opposite occurs for the uncoated material. For the domestic thermal and prototype hydrogen stores a selection of AB and AB 2 intermetallic hydrides enhanced through catalysis or thermodynamic modification were investigated. TiFe produced via powder atomisation obtained thermodynamic properties (dehydrogenation H = 28. 9 kJ/mol H 2 and S = 105 J/K. mol H 2) in line with published results. The minor substitution of Ni into TiFe 1 -xNix resulted in different hydrogenation characteristics to TiFe, for example, TiFe 0 : 96 Ni 0 : 04 possessed a dehydrogenation of H = 29. 9 kJ/mol H 2 and S = 107 J/K. mol H 2. Discrepancies between maximum achieved and theoretical capacities were observed for both atomised TiFe and TiFe 0 : 96 Ni 0 : 04 and a range of possible contributing factors are discussed. A minor addition of Pd (1. 17 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|The European Union targets a {{reduction}} of greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % of renewable energy sources in the EU energy mix by 2020. New generations of technologies have to be developed through breakthroughs in research if the vision is to be met. The deregulation of the electric power market has opened the market to investors seeking profits and growth via the installation of additional capacity. This literature review report is a introductory step towards a more detailed and targeted work for a system concept evaluation, analysis and optimization of solar turbines in concentrating solar thermal power production. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) has grown {{in recent years to}} be the largest bulk producer of solar electricity in the world and every square meter of a CSP field that produces 400 - 500 kWh of electricity per year, saves 0, 45 ton of CO 2 and contributes to a 0, 1 ton reduction of fossil fuels use annually. The CSP is divided in two concepts and three main technologies: Linear– and point focus concept; Parabolic trough -, Power Tower- and dish- Stirling engine technologies. Whereas the Power Tower technology has the best gross efficiency, the parabolic trough has the advantage to be the most mature technology, being in grid connected power plant operation for at least two decades. Dish-Stirling engine systems have the highest net efficiency but suffer from the sensibility to insolation fluctuations and lack of storage. There are various thermal storage medias and storage concepts to help achieving the best thermal characteristics for charging and discharging to the CSP technology in question. The dispatch time ranges from 0, 5 hour for maintenance and service up to 16 - 24 hours thermal energy dispatchability. The most recently commercialized <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> is phase change material, i. e. salt mixtures with good thermal characteristics. Research for other kind of media suitable for CSP-technology is performed continuously. The operation modes of a CSP plant depends on the choice of electricity production; dispatch electricity during day-time hours or prolonging the electricity production beyond sunset. The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is another CSP concept using organic thermal fluid instead of steam to the turbine, at a lower temperature and pressure range. The power output is of range 1 – 5 MW for electricity production. The ORC ability to use simpler components and the possibility to deployment in rural areas as well as on limited space in urban areas, make it more economical feasible. The organic fluid is for example n-pentane and toluene. The net efficiency for ORC-plants has been proven to achieve 30 % under optimal conditions, comparing to the Rankine cycle practical efficiency of 36 - 40 %. The experiences from CSP plant operation have raised a demand for improvement of the steam turbine’s work performance. The steam turbine has until recently being designed to be in continuous work. The steam turbine operating in solar thermal plants should have the capability to start up directly and go from idle to rated condition in a matter of minutes. The CSP-plant start-ups per year is higher where the cycling thermal stresses can cause material fatigue leading to shorter life time. Efficient collector, storage design and optimal turbine operation should reduce the number of start-ups and shutdowns per year and the transient loads on the steam turbine. QC 2012021...|$|E
30|$|The {{addition}} of nanoparticles may induce {{an increase in}} both the thermal capacity and the thermal conductivity of the <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> [19 – 23]. This behavior along {{with the introduction of}} the concept of nanofluid, as a fluid with nanoparticles suspended by Brownian motion, was introduced in 1995 by Choi who showed an increase in thermal properties of some fluids when copper and aluminum nanoparticles were added [24]. The increase of the thermal capacity of a <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> may allow several advantages for the <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> systems since a high quantity of heat can be stored in a small volume of material. In this way the <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> systems become more compact, reducing the overall costs.|$|R
40|$|Nano-enhanced {{phase change}} {{materials}} (PCMs) have attracted increasing attention to address {{one of the}} key barriers (i. e. low thermal conductivity) to the wide adoption of PCMs in many industrial applications. This paper discusses the generic problem and key issues associated with appropriately using this new class of materials in buildings for effective thermal management and improved energy performance. An overview on major recent development and application of nano-enhanced PCMs as <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> is provided. A case study based on a PCM ceiling ventilation system integrated with solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collectors is then performed to evaluate the potential benefits due to the dispersion of copper nanoparticles into the PCM base fluid of RT 24. The results showed that this nano-enhanced PCM has higher melting and solidification rates than that of the pure PCM. Compared {{to the use of the}} pure PCM, 8. 3 % more heat was charged in and 25. 1 % more heat was discharged from the nano-enhanced PCM under the three winter test days. More research is needed to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind the PCM thermal conductivity enhancement through the dispersion of nanometer-sized materials and to investigate how these mechanisms drive building performance enhancement...|$|R
40|$|The solid to {{liquid phase}} {{transformation}} of LiOH {{has been proposed}} as an ideal candidate <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> for a Rankine Cycle powered electrical generation unit envisioned in Space Station based solar dynamic systems. Due to the corrosive nature of molten hydroxides, long term containment of LiOH is of concern. Pure nickel {{is thought to be}} a suitably resistant material, and a program has been instituted to measure the effects of prolonged exposure of liquid and gaseous LiOH on the mechanical properties of pure nickel alloys. Results to date indicate that negligible weight and thickness changes occurred in Ni alloys exposed to LiOH for as long as 2500 hr at 775 K, and essentially no difference in 77 - 900 K tensile properties could be detected between LiOH exposed and vacuum annealed Ni specimens. Although there was little sign of outward damage, microstructural examination revealed that all hydroxide contaminated tensile test specimens had surface connected intergranular cracks along the gage lengths. Two other potential problems, which have strong implications with respect to a LiOH/Ni energy storage system, were also noted during the corrosion experiments. In particular stress corrosion cracking of weld joints in pressurized vessel and permeation of hydrogen through nickel were observed...|$|R
