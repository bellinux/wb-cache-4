5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|NASA also {{researches}} and publishes {{on climate}} issues. Its statements concur with the interpretation {{that the global}} climate is heating. Bob Walker, who has advised the 45th President of the United States Donald Trump on space issues, has advocated <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as NOAA.|$|E
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's {{commitment}} to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, {{and many of the}} major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.|$|E
50|$|The disks <b>that</b> <b>NASA's</b> {{scientists}} at the Goddard Space Flight Centre aim to find are debris disks, which are older than 5 million years; and Young Stellar Object, or YSO disks, which are younger than 5 million years.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Constellation Program {{has made}} the most {{progress}} in a generation towards building an integrated human-rated spacecraft and launch vehicle. During that development, it became clear <b>that</b> <b>NASA's</b> human-rating requirements lacked the specificity necessary to defend a program plan, particularly human-rating test flight plans, from severe budget challenges. This paper addresses the progress Constellation achieved, problems encountered in clarifying and defending a human-rating certification plan, and discusses key considerations for those who find themselves in similar straits with future human-rated spacecraft and vehicles. We assert, and support with space flight data, <b>that</b> <b>NASA's</b> current human-rating requirements do not adequately address "unknown-unknowns", or the unexpected things the hardware can reveal to the designer during test...|$|R

25|$|Kean {{and others}} deem it highly {{questionable}} <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> could actually lose such records. However, {{this would not}} be a unique case for NASA; for example, the original tapes recorded during the televised Apollo 11 Moon landing were misplaced or reused.|$|E

50|$|Criticism of the Space Shuttle program {{stemmed from}} claims <b>that</b> <b>NASA's</b> Shuttle program {{failed to achieve}} its promised cost and utility goals, as well as design, cost, management, and safety issues.

25|$|Human {{exploration}} by the United States {{was identified}} as a long-term goal in the Vision for Space Exploration announced in 2004 by then US President George W. Bush.

Griffin stated <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> aims to put a person on Mars by 2037.|$|E
25|$|Kean {{also wrote}} that {{she tried to}} get more {{information}} from Steitz, the NASA spokesperson who issued the surprising statement in 2005 <b>that</b> <b>NASA</b> had indeed examined debris related to Kecksburg, supposedly from a Russian space probe. But Steitz never responded. Kean was particularly interested in Steitz's source of information to make such a statement, since he also indicated there were no surviving records and the court-ordered search also turned up no relevant records.|$|E
