Fig.  14 {{illustrates}} an example of testing application, where setting of number of repetitions and selection of the <b>tested</b> <b>command</b> can be seen. After the test is completed, a notification window is displayed with information about the particular test. Although the number of well recognized commands is one hundred of one hundred, the average recognition success rate is only 94.61  %. This is because the number of recognized words is a real value, while average recognition success rate represents a program-wise estimated recognition success rate. Ambient noise, which influences the very recognition, is a major factor that has a great influence on aver-age recognition success rate. 10 persons of different sex and age have participated in testing of this system. Both men and women in age range of 22 – 50  years. An integrated microphone, which {{is a part of}} a PC, and a wireless microphone (Logitech Wireless Headset H 600) have been used for testing. Every speaker tested a random voice command several times. Each of the ten speakers has <b>tested</b> the given <b>command,</b> in the first case (lights on) 100 times. In order to compare results of the individual speakers, testing was performed on the same command for each of them. The result is an average percentage success rate of the <b>tested</b> <b>command</b> and real recognition success rate of the success rate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{continues}} to be a trend towards using the power of cloud computing to tackle inherently large and complicated problem domains. Validating domain-intensive cloud applications presents a significant challenge because of the complexity of both the problem domain and the underlying cloud platform. In this paper, we describe an approach that leverages model-driven engineering to improve testing domain-intensive cloud applications. Our approach combines a set of abstract <b>test</b> <b>commands</b> with various domain and configuration models to define a domain-specific testing language. We have developed a prototype of our approach that provides language editing and platform configuration tools to aid test specification, execution and debugging...|$|R

The Army <b>testing</b> <b>command</b> stated that if the number of stoppages caused by a broken part met some threshold, they would be eliminated from the final report pending redesign of the part. Colt also claimed that the testing conditions were unfair to the M4, as the M4s used in the test were normal guns from active inventory, with remaining service life varying randomly. Further, the trial M4s had burst-mode fire groups, which are more complicated and prone to failure than the fully automatic fire groups the other manufacturers presented for testing.|$|R

40|$|Humans can {{understand}} and produce new utterances effortlessly, {{thanks to their}} systematic compositional skills. Once a person learns {{the meaning of a}} new verb "dax," he or she can immediately understand the meaning of "dax twice" or "sing and dax. " In this paper, we introduce the SCAN domain, consisting of a set of simple compositional navigation commands paired with the corresponding action sequences. We then test the zero-shot generalization capabilities of a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on SCAN with sequence-to-sequence methods. We find that RNNs can generalize well when the differences between training and <b>test</b> <b>commands</b> are small, so that they can apply "mix-and-match" strategies to solve the task. However, when generalization requires systematic compositional skills (as in the "dax" example above), RNNs fail spectacularly. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in neural machine translation, supporting the conjecture that lack of systematicity is an important factor explaining why neural networks need very large training sets...|$|R

The model utilizes five techniques to encourage five concepts shown to be critical for effective budget execution.

Development of questionnaires for testing the model at five Naval field activities in California and the test results are also presented. Over 60 cost center managers from five <b>test</b> <b>commands</b> responded to the questionnaires and rated the model as yielding potential benefits over their current procedures. The respondents rated the model as having "moderate" acceptability and "good" applicability. Based on the test results, widespread promulgation of the model is recommended within the U. S.
