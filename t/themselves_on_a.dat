5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries <b>themselves,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|McMillin's {{success in}} Louisiana {{allowed him to}} move on to Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where he was the school's 13th head {{football}} coach for three seasons (1925–1927).

Geneva College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history.

5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

Evans personally made £75million out of the sale.|$|E
25|$|The mating {{habits of}} Limax maximus are {{considered}} unusual among slugs: the hermaphrodite slugs court, usually for hours, by circling and licking each other.

25|$|These {{political}} and religious issues were constantly intertwined, and interacted in various ways. Christianity in Britain and Ireland largely progressed through royal patronage, while kings increasingly used the Church to stabilise and to confer legitimacy on their fragile states. A strongly local church with distinctive practices could {{be a source of}} great support to a fledgling state, allowing the weaving together of {{political and}} religious elites. Conversely, the Roman connection introduced foreign influence beyond the control of local rulers, but also allowed rulers to display <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wider, European stage, and to seek out more powerful sources of legitimacy.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, six {{companies}} of the 22nd Regiment were released from their entrenchments {{and ordered to}} reinforce the line of Union skirmishers that lay {{to the north of}} the fortifications.

Doing so, they cleared out a pocket of Confederate sharpshooters that had established <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nearby hilltop and who had been harassing the Union forces overnight. By 7:00a.m., the 24th regiment of the Veteran Reserve Corps arrived at Fort Kearny to relieve the remaining {{companies of}} the 22nd, which were dispatched northward as reserves for the first six companies, which had already advanced two miles north of Fort Kearny.|$|E
25|$|Yuri Sokolov, {{the head}} of the {{folklore}} section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat. Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens. He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.|$|E
