Apu {{explains}} that if Proposition 24 passes, he will have to leave the United States, as his visa expired many years earlier. Apu is forced to go to Fat Tony to obtain a false United States citizenship. However, feeling guilty and embarrassed about taking the fraudulent route, he realizes he has disgraced his parents by <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on his Indian heritage, and tears up the fake passport.|$|E

He was charged with committing an obscene act and banned from performing in public, and his theatre group's grants were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Gleeson {{made his}} {{comeback}} to basketball after signing a three-year deal {{to be the}} Head Coach of the Perth Wildcats – the NBL's most successful franchise with five championships. In the months prior to joining the Wildcats, Gleeson was inches from <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on basketball for good. Feeling refreshed after his AFL stint, but unsure of his coaching future long-term, the chance to join the Wildcats in 2013 came {{at just the right}} time. Gleeson took over from coach Rob Beveridge, who had developed a winning-culture at the Wildcats (one championship and three grand finals in four years) behind a core group consisting of Shawn Redhage, Damian Martin, Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Greg Hire.|$|E

25|$|By tradition, each British monarch {{faces in}} the {{opposite}} direction of his or her predecessor; this is said to date from 1661, with Charles II <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on Oliver Cromwell. Hence, George VI faced left and the present Queen faces right. The only break in this tradition almost occurred in 1936 when Edward VIII, believing his left side to be superior to his right, insisted on his image facing left, as his father's image had. No official legislation prevented his wishes being granted, so left-facing obverses were prepared for minting. Very few examples were struck before he abdicated later that year, but none bearing this portrait ever were issued officially. When George VI acceded to the throne, his image was placed to face left, implying that, had any coins been minted with Edward's portrait the obverses would have depicted Edward facing right and maintained the tradition.|$|E

[...] "Nothing embitters my old age," [...] he said late in life, like [...] "the circulation of absurd stories that I retire as civilization advances..." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{failing in}} the fourth Test, Ponsford was again dropped. The hostile barrage of short-pitched bowling had {{a major impact on}} Ponsford's {{technique}} and career. In the three Tests that Ponsford played during the Bodyline series, he estimated he was hit around fifty times. During the series Ponsford developed a habit of <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the rising ball and, if hit, glowering at the affected bowler. While the manager of the England team, Pelham Warner, thought that Ponsford [...] "met the fast-leg theory in plucky and able style", this behaviour was criticised by the British cricket writer, R. C. Robertson-Glasgow. Bradman thought that the Bodyline tactics hastened Ponsford's eventual retirement.|$|E
500|$|Levesque {{was known}} {{backstage}} {{as one of}} the members of The Kliq, a stable of wrestlers including; Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman and Scott Hall, who were known for influencing Vince McMahon and the WWF creative team. It has been claimed that he was scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring tournament, but the victory was instead awarded to Stone Cold Steve Austin after the , in which the Kliq broke character after a match to say goodbye to the departing Nash and Hall. Despite the punishment, Helmsley did have success following the MSG Incident. Mr. Perfect became his manager and he won the Intercontinental Championship for the first time on October 21, 1996, defeating Marc Mero. When Mr. Perfect left the WWF, his departure was explained to be a result of Helmsley <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on his manager as soon as he won the Intercontinental Championship. Helmsley held the title [...] for nearly four months before dropping it to Rocky Maivia on the February 13, 1997 special episode of Monday Night Raw, called Thursday Raw Thursday. For a very brief time, Helmsley was accompanied by Mr. Hughes, who was his storyline bodyguard reminiscent of Ted DiBiase and Virgil. After losing the Intercontinental title, he feuded with Goldust, defeating him at WrestleMania 13. During their feud, Chyna debuted as his new bodyguard.|$|E

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for [...] "Blame Canada". When {{the time came to}} perform the track live at the ceremony, as is customary for the Academy Awards, it ran into trouble with ABC's standards and practices department: censors demanded they write TV-friendly lyrics. [...] "It would be ironic to have to change the words in a movie about censorship," [...] remarked Shaiman. Censors were particularly unhappy {{with the use of the}} word [...] "fuck" [...] and allusions to the Ku Klux Klan. When Parker and Shaiman declined these requests, Robin Williams, a friend of Shaiman's, sang the song with black tape over his mouth and <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> when curse words were to be sung. Parker and Stone attended the ceremony in drag, wearing replicas of dresses previously worn at the Oscars by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. The two claimed years later that they took acid before the ceremony and were high while wearing the outfits. The song ended up losing to [...] "You'll Be in My Heart", a Tarzan song by Phil Collins (that film came from ABC parent Disney). In response, Parker and Stone ridiculed him in two consecutive episodes of the series' fourth season ("Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000" [...] and [...] "Timmy 2000"). In DVD commentary, Parker states [...] "we were fully expecting to lose, just not to Phil Collins".|$|E

[...] His first course of lectures on sound were a complete failure, due to his abhorrence of public speaking. In the rostrum he was tongue-tied and incapable, sometimes <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the audience and mumbling to the diagrams on the wall.

Or was he a befuddled, out-of-touch chief being manipulated, knowingly or unwittingly, by—well, by whom exactly?

[...] This change, according to Buchanan, [...] "was possibly precipitated by the coming of tabernacles for reservation, which were ideally both to occupy a central position and also to be fixed to the east wall without the president <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> to them." ...|$|E
