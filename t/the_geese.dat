5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and <b>the</b> <b>Geese,</b> {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the zoo {{experienced}} a pest {{problem with the}} Canada goose. The park had become so over-crowded with <b>the</b> <b>geese,</b> that the zoo had {{to take action to}} decrease their numbers.

To cope with the problem, the zoo hired a sharpshooter, who killed 19 geese. Zoo workers also destroyed 144 eggs found on the property.

25|$|For example, {{eutrophication}} initiates top-down control via {{the impact}} of snow geese on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. <b>The</b> <b>geese</b> grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to oxygenate the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable environment for marsh plants disallows sexual recruitment to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by clonal runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).|$|E
25|$|In January 1874, an Albany, Oregon newspaper, the State Rights Democrat, {{published}} a complaint by Mr. Preston Bowman, of Spring Hill (a little down river from Independence), {{that he had}} kept tame geese, and {{the crew of the}} Alice had recently been amusing themselves by shooting <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> as the steamer passed by his place up and down the river.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced {{overfeeding}} and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined. In the necropolis of Saqqara, in {{the tomb of}} Mereruka, an important royal official, there is a bas relief scene wherein workers grasp geese around the necks in order to push food down their throats. At the side stand tables piled with more food pellets, and a flask for moistening the feed before giving it to <b>the</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|E

25|$|On St. Martin's Day, {{children}} in Flanders, the southern and north-western {{parts of the}} Netherlands, and the Catholic areas of Germany and Austria still participate in paper lantern processions. Often, a man dressed as St. Martin rides on a horse {{in front of the}} procession. The children sing songs about St. Martin and about their lanterns. The food traditionally eaten on the day is goose, a rich bird. According to legend, Martin was reluctant to become bishop, which is why he hid in a stable filled with geese.

25|$|In {{some areas}} such as Cape Peninsula, the sparrowhawks face habitat {{competition}} with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca), an aggressive species known to steal the nests of the sparrowhawks. This results in a costly loss for the sparrowhawks after the time and energy spent building the nest and may also lead {{to the death of}} current offspring. However, sparrowhawks occasionally have more than 1 nest at a time, or they can readily build a new nest, so, in the event that one is usurped by an Egyptian goose, the pair will sometimes start breeding again in a nearby alternative nest; or they might wait until <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> have left the nest with their goslings, or they abandon breeding for that year.|$|E
25|$|One of Langston's most {{difficult}} challenges {{is dealing with}} the giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) which inhabit the tidal marshes of Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River. Hundreds of the birds inhabit the marshes. The birds not only feed voraciously on the course's grasses, but their feces harm the greens and pose a health hazard to golfers. They also feed on and destroy the marsh plants which the National Park Service planted in Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River in the hope that these will help filter the water and restore the health of the river. In 2007, federal park officials began considering a program to cull <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> population around Langston Golf Course in an attempt to save the river, an effort opposed by some animal rights groups.|$|E

25|$|The 150th {{anniversary of}} Bell's birth in 1997 {{was marked by}} a special issue of {{commemorative}} £1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland.

500|$|The {{book has}} been called [...] "feminist", and more {{specifically}} [...] "vintage Atwood-feminist", but Atwood disagrees, saying, [...] "I wouldn't even call it feminist. Every time you write something {{from the point of}} view of a woman, people say that it's feminist." [...] The Penelopiads antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in Cat's Eye, and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship: [...] "Consider us pure symbol. We're no more real than money." ...|$|E
500|$|The salt marshes on this coast are {{stated in}} the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{notification}} document to be [...] "among the best in Europe...the flora is exceptionally diverse". Holkham also has good examples of sand dunes, and the pines planted on the dunes have provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established, making this the only substantial area of woodland in the North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The dunes are created and altered by the elements, and the sand islands in Holkham Bay have formed only within the last 60 years. The flat ground inland from the dunes is reclaimed salt marsh that was used as pasture until the 1940s, but converted [...] to arable land during World War II. The value of the fields to wildlife was reduced by the resulting lower water table, but Natural England's management measures have raised the water levels, attracting breeding and wintering birds. Water management {{can also be used}} to ensure a high water table in summer, benefiting breeding waders, and drier conditions in winter, preferred by <b>the</b> <b>geese.</b> The management of water levels and grassland increased the numbers of breeding wetland birds from 120 pairs of ten species in 1986 to 795 pairs of 26 species in 1994, and the number of wintering birds of four key wildfowl species rose from 1,215 to 17,305 in the decade from 1983/84.|$|E
