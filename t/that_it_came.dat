He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> through in his performances.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the Peak District name {{include the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from the Pecsaetan or peaklanders, an Anglo-Saxon tribe who inhabited the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century AD when it fell within the large Anglian kingdom of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5000|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Valpó and in German as Walpach. In antiquity, it was called Iovalum. [...] There are several {{suggested}} etymologies. One is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Latin root *Iov-, meaning [...] "divine". However, the ending can't be explained by Latin. One explanation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified. Perhaps the simplest explanation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European word *wel, meaning [...] "valley", whatever [...] "Io-" [...] meant.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} {{for the name}} [...] "Odra". One is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Croatian word [...] "oderati" [...] (to cut through). The other is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European root *wodr (water).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{suggested}} etymologies {{for the name}} [...] "Karašica". It's not explainable in Croatian. One is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Turkish words [...] "kara su" [...] (black stream). Second is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Latin word [...] "Carassius", denoting several species of freshwater fish. Perhaps the most likely one is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European root *(s)ker, meaning [...] "to cut", in the sense [...] "the river that cuts through the valley".|$|R
5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from bats.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5000|$|Psunj {{was called}} [...] "Pisunus" [...] in antiquity. There are several {{suggested}} etymologies for that. One is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European root *pekj (cattle). The other is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European roots *peiH (big, {{in the sense}} [...] "mountain") and *sen (old). One very similar to <b>that</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from *peiH and *sewn (black). The other is <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> related to the Latin word [...] "pinus", meaning [...] "pine tree" [...] or [...] "resin", itself without a widely accepted etymology.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} for the hydronym. One is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Croatian word [...] "oriti", meaning [...] "echo". The other is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Indo-European root *h1or, meaning [...] "to flow". If so, then the same root {{is seen in}} the hydronym [...] "Raša".|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> very close to being completed.|$|E
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{explanations}} of the village name. It is usually said to derive from 'horse ford', {{but it has also}} been suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the River Hor on which the village stands (more usually known to locals as 'the Beck'). A third explanation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from Horsa, the name of a Saxon chief.|$|R
50|$|Another {{suggested}} derivation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from Shawnee cake {{although some}} writers disagree.|$|R

5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not {{actually}} carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> over their heads. Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up.|$|E

5000|$|The {{etymology}} of Silla is {{not known}} for certain. Some say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Arabic Sila, others say from Latin, and still others from Catalan meaning [...] "the island". Among these three theories, the most commonly accepted one is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from Latin, {{as it has been}} proved that there was a Roman cellar where the town is situated now.|$|R

25|$|In pre-modern medicine, the {{explanation}} {{given by the}} now-discredited theory of humorism for cannibalism was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> about within a black acrimonious humor, which, being lodged in the linings of the ventricle, produced the voracity for human flesh.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, {{the gold}} {{discovered}} in Coloma first brought thousands of miners from Sonora in northern Mexico {{on the way}} to the gold fields. So many of them settled in the area north of the Plaza <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to be known as Sonoratown.|$|E
5000|$|The name Vinkovci is {{supposed}} {{to come from the}} common Croatian personal name [...] "Vinko". It was called Cibalae in antiquity. There are several proposed etymologies for [...] "Cibalae". Those who advocate that Illyrian was a satem language generally advocate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from Proto-Indo-European *ghebhel (head), in the sense [...] "hill". Those who advocate the theory that Ilyrian was a centum language generally advocate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from Proto-Indo-European words *kjey (house) and *bel (strong), so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "strong house".|$|R
