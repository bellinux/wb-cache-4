The eldest member of the family then distributes new rice to other members of the family. All the household articles are cleaned. People greet each other. It is a community festival celebrated by every Hindu family. The popularity of the festival is such that festival greetings even come from the honorable Prime Minister of India.|$|E

2500|$|The SCAR-less {{method is}} able to induce point mutations, oligonucleotide-mediated deletions, and short {{sequence}} insertions with a high efficiency. In the case of point mutations, oligonucleotides targeted to the lagging strand are designed to alter the either the PAM sequence or the protospacer sequences within 12 base pairs of the PAM as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> region for Cas9 specificity. With this process, both nonsense and missense mutations are possible. However, the subsequent transformations differ between nonsense and missense mutations: double transformations, where the pCas9cr4 plasmid and oligonucleotide are transformed simultaneously, are more efficient for nonsense mutations while single transformations, where each plasmid and oligonucleotide are transformed independently, are better suited for missense mutations [...] as demonstrated by colony PCR. The method is also able to successfully delete large regions of chromosomal DNA using oligonucleotides designed with upstream and downstream homology {{to the area of}} deletion. In the case of deletions, a single transformation protocol is more efficient and shows a 100% deletion rate following colony PCR. Further work should be pursued to determine causes for the different transformation efficiencies for various mutation types.|$|E

"There {{are strong}} {{arguments}} {{that support the}} idea that in the past the main ritual activity performed on a temporal basis was the worship of Shu nature spirits on the first days (usually on a dragon or snake day) of the second lunar month, and that this was the traditional New Year of the Naxi. In Baidi, where the old traditions have been preserved, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> festival, when everybody dressed in their best clothes, gathers around the Baishuitai terrace in a festive atmosphere and pay respect to the Shu gods of nature." ...

2500|$|There are two archeological zones/former {{ceremonial}} {{sites in}} El Lobo and a cave {{area in the}} community of Neblinas. There are small indigenous temples in Potero del Llano, Agua Zarca, El Sabinito and La Campana, which contain stone and clay idols linked to the Pame, Huasteco and Jonaz cultures. The La Campana site in the municipality has been sacked and destroyed, despite recent measures taken to protect local sites. The crime was reported by archeologists María Teresa Muñoz Espinoza and José Carlos Castañeda Reyes, who state that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> site of the area. The site belongs to the Huasteca culture and dated to about 600 CE. It is located between the communities of La Campana and Las Ánimas. [...] The site has also been damaged by landslides, possibly provoked by the illegal mining of white sand in the area. This is where the worst damage to the site is. The site measures thirty eight meters long and five meters in depth. Thefts include a complete burial with various ceramic objects. A large grinding stone was destroyed intentionally. The site was discovered about sixty years ago but there has been no budget to excavate it formally. However, there have been about 160 structured counted including platforms, plazas, patios and more. There is a push to cover and protect the area, especially that closest to where the sand mining occurs.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{somewhat}} technical-sounding name, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> bar to rescission in practice. [...] "Counter restitution" [...] simply means [...] "putting the parties back" [...] to their positions before {{the contract was}} consummated. For example, if our contract was a pen for £1, counter restitution would mean you giving back the pound and me giving up the pen. The aim {{is to ensure that}} a claimant is not unjustly enriched as a result of rescission. It used to be that common law courts insisted on precise restitution. So in Clarke v Dickson it was held that a defrauded investor could not rescind the purchase of his shares because the investment was bound up in the company and the shares were now worth less. Precise counter restitution was impossible. However, the rule was mitigated, becoming more lenient. Now only substantial restitution is necessary. In Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co promoters (who are in law fiduciaries, and therefore subject to a duty to disclose material facts) did not tell investors that a mine on Sombrero island had been bought by the promoters for half the price that they were now valuing it for in the company. By the time investors realised, however, a substantial amount of phosphate had been mined. It clearly could not be put back in the ground. But Lord Blackburn held that since substantial restitution (i.e. the money equivalent) could be paid, rescission of the share contracts was not barred.|$|E

2500|$|After the veneration of the image, {{visitors}} {{gather in}} the Concordia Plaza for the [...] "trueque" [...] (trade), to exchange and sell goods, a tradition from the pre-Hispanic period. Common items include cheese from Chiautla, fresh and dried herbs (both culinary and medicinal), ocote wood, incense, nuts, fruits from various parts of Puebla state, resins, [...] "mecapales", vanilla pods, saffron, peanuts, and crafts such as palm frond mats (petates), baskets, clay pots and wooden utensils. While September 8 {{is considered to be}} the date of the Virgin's first appearance in Cholula, the date is also related to Chiconauhquiauhitl (goddess of nine rains) who was worshiped {{at the top of this}} pyramid at the end of the pre-Hispanic period. The Spanish replaced this image with that of the Virgin of the Remedies. Very early on 8 September, residents and pilgrims come to the pyramid and sanctuary to sing [...] "Las mañanitas" [...] and carrying paper lamps. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> religious event in the city, with events related to it on almost every block. This event brings in people from all parts of the city and from many parts of the region. One tradition associated with this is the exchange of small gifts among the strangers in the crowd. Traditional dress is usually worn only for this event. For women, this includes a black or dark blue skirt, with trim in magenta, or emerald green, a wrap belt tied on the hip, a blouse embroidered with flowers, a rebozo or neckerchief, with earrings and a cross of silver. Men wear loose pants and shirts of natural cotton cloth, huaraches, a wrap belt with one end hanging loose in front, and wool shoulder wrap decorated with geometric designs and a palm frond hat. Concurrent with the feast of the Virgin from the 1 to the 16th of September is the regional fair. The trueque, while still practiced in its original form, has also evolved into this regional fair, called the Feria de Cholula. It features local food and music, culminating on Mexico's Independence Day.|$|E
