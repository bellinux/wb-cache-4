5|$|Construction {{work began}} in August 1898, {{although}} the BS was continuing {{to develop new}} route plans. The bill for 1899, published on 22 November 1898, requested more time for the construction works and proposed two extensions to the railway and a modification to part of the previously approved route. The first extension, like the NC's plan from the year before, was to branch from the already-approved route under Park Crescent, but <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> a more northerly route than the NC, running under Regent's Park to cross the park's Outer Circle between Chester Road and Cumberland Gate where a station was to be constructed. The route <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), Cumberland Market, Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (both now Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street {{on the west side}} of Euston station.|$|E
5|$|Detailed to the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, McClelland {{earned his}} wings by {{attending}} ground {{school at the}} University of Texas, flying gunnery and advanced fighter courses at Rockwell Field in San Diego, California. <b>Then</b> <b>followed</b> an assignment at Roosevelt Field, New York, and in December 1918, he became commandant of training, commanding officer of the cadet detachment and assistant engineering officer at Love Field, Dallas, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Several Acts of Parliament <b>then</b> <b>followed.</b> The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates {{proposed}} that the clergy pay no more than 5% of their first year's revenue (annates) to Rome.

50|$|The LMCT follows Illinois Route 137 {{from the}} state line south on Sheridan Road and joins Lake Shore Drive (U.S. 41).

50|$|The route {{continues}} from Presidio on U.S. Route 67 (US 67) to the Interstate 10 (I-10) interchange. It <b>then</b> <b>follows</b> I-10/US 67 until US 67 goes north off the interstate and intersects US 385. The route <b>then</b> <b>follows</b> US 385 to Odessa, Texas at I-20. It <b>then</b> <b>follows</b> I-20 east to FM 1788 south of Midland International Airport. It follows FM 1788 {{north to the}} proposed SH 349 reliever route to the main highway north of Midland. The final leg of the highway follows SH 349 to Lamesa.|$|R
5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who had {{remained}} at home while Mario went on the adventure.

5|$|As {{the size}} of train increased, so did the locomotives. The 4-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} became popular for passenger and mixed traffic work with the D3 and A2 classes, and the 2-8-0 arrangement on goods with the K, J and C classes lasting into the 1960s. These were <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> by the 4-6-2 S class Pacifics for the Spirit of Progress express, and the single 4-8-4 H class locomotive H220, the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive. The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4-6-4 R class and 2-8-0 J classes. Although they were of more modern design, their advantages were overshadowed by the simultaneous arrival of the first diesels.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> by the T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering {{has had a}} monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E

After a brief landing and {{examination of the}} remains of Borchgrevink's camp, the ship continued southwards along the Victoria Land coast. At McMurdo Sound Discovery turned eastward, touching land again at Cape Crozier where a pre-arranged message point was set up so that relief ships {{would be able to}} locate the expedition. She <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> the Barrier to its eastern extremity where, on 30 January, the land predicted by Ross was confirmed, and named King Edward VII Land.|$|E
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was <b>then</b> <b>followed</b> by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E

At the Thomas Cup in May, Malaysia lost to {{eventual}} winners Denmark in the semi-finals despite Lee winning all the matches he contested in the tournament. In June, Lee won his 6th and record-equaling Indonesia Open title, becoming the third shuttler and first non-Indonesian to win the title six times. He was set to play in the Australian Open, but withdrew due to a muscle injury.|$|E
5|$|In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again {{finished}} in shared first place, {{this time with}} his mentor Simen Agdestein. A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores {{in the event of}} a 1–1 draw had been revoked previously. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the second—so the match went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the first rapid game, Agdestein the second. <b>Then</b> <b>followed</b> three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game.|$|E

North of the park, the highway crossed into southern Sanilac County and followed the shoreline to the community of Lexington where it intersected the eastern end of M-90.

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} measurements {{revealed the}} existence of a planet with a mass of at least 7 Earths. This planet, GJ 3634 b, became the first planet to be discovered under the new strategy.
