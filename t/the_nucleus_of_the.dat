5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection.

5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor.

40|$|One hundred liver {{specimens}} of hepatitis B surface antigen positive cases {{were used for}} this study. <b>The</b> localization <b>of</b> hepatitis B core antigen in the bile duct epithelia was investigated by immunoperoxidase method.

(The troops serving under Grant were <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union's successful Army of the Tennessee, although that name was not yet in use.) Grant's plan was to advance upon the fort on February 6 while it was being simultaneously attacked by Union gunboats commanded by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. A combination of accurate and effective naval gunfire, heavy rain, and the poor siting of the fort, nearly inundated by rising river waters, caused its commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, to surrender to Foote before the Union Army arrived.|$|E
5|$|Other notable Irish {{physicists}} include Ernest Walton, {{winner of}} the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, {{he was the first}} to split <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may escape to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases {{the activity of}} oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E

5|$|The Louvre Palace was altered {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} Middle Ages.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lithium atom verges on instability, {{since the}} two stable lithium {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{made the}} Treaty of Brussels with Spain in 1656. This {{gathered}} Spanish {{support for a}} restoration in return for Charles's contribution to the war against France.

The Commonwealth made the Treaty of Paris with France in 1657 to join them in war against Spain in the Netherlands. Royalist supporters in the Spanish force were led by Charles's younger brother James, Duke of York.

5|$|In April 1943, the {{commander}} of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, Hopkinson, was promoted to major general and given command of the division.

'R1' Patrol was to pick up Captain David Stirling and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields {{to the west of}} Tobruk. Only 21 men arrived at the rendezvous and were returned to the British lines, later becoming <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Special Air Service (SAS). One of the other roles assigned to the LRDG was to transport SAS units behind enemy lines; this continued until the SAS were issued with their own transport in 1942.

The officers were the advance land party of Operation Flipper, which had planned to kill General Rommel.|$|E
