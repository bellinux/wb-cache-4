It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with.</b> <b>It</b> affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E
25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since {{it was only a}} few months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain for granted and has learned <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of many other things, including a thorn in the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E

500|$|Bergkamp's {{nickname}} is the [...] "Non-Flying Dutchman" [...] due to {{his fear}} of flying. This stemmed from an incident with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight, prompting a journalist to joke about having a bomb in his bag. Following this incident, Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help:I've got this problem and I have <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I can't do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can't explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can't fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can't sleep.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to}} do with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E

When Giles asked what the title meant, Murdoch informed him that [...] "It's Latin, Frank; the e means you're out and the meritus means you deserved it." [...] Murdoch later said that [...] "circulation went up and it stayed up. We didn't lose money or anything like that", referring to the 20,000 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, {{and the fact that}} Stern returned all the money paid to it by the Sunday Times. In April 2012, during the Leveson Inquiry, he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying [...] "It was a massive mistake I made and I will have <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Trevor-Roper died in 2003. Despite a long and respected career as a historian, according to Richard Davenport-Hines, his biographer, Trevor-Roper's role in the scandal left his reputation [...] "permanently besmirched". In January 1984 Broyles resigned as editor of Newsweek, to [...] "pursue new entrepreneurial ventures".|$|E

Newman had been given unfettered access to Mulroney for a thorough biography, and claims Mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers. After the falling out, Mulroney began work on his autobiography, without Newman's help.

It has no doubt helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind." [...] Adding, “Sometimes all I see is darkness; it's overpowering.
