[...] The story also stated that [...] "The U.S. military did not get all the additional American forces into Iraq until June 15, so it would be premature to draw a final statistical picture of the effect of the added troops."

[...] Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies {{in the region of}} Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly [...] below the surface. The existence of hot springs at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes. This long history of volcanic activity along a still active plate boundary indicates that volcanic eruptions in the Garibaldi Belt have not ended and risks for future eruptions remain.|$|E
2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> to that question is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E

2500|$|Online {{publication}} NewMusicBox—which normally covers new American music {{outside the}} commercial mainstream—argued that the Beach Boys could never earn themselves [...] "the same {{pride of place}} in American music history held by other great innovators" [...] because of their mistaken reputation as a [...] "light-hearted party band that drooled over California Girls while on a Surfing Safari," [...] hampered not only by the over-saturation of their early songs being used in film, commercials, and other media, but also [...] "...their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison contests that the group produced work that could [...] "almost" [...] be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, [...] "The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces." [...] While the group [...] "went into the great void beyond", such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: [...] "What influences could these innovations then have? <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. … It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation. In the end, we must conclude that the Beach Boys' late-1960s experiments were not reproducible." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (M132) The British commissioners {{were almost}} as much embarrassed by their friends at home as by their friends or foes at Washington. Both ministers and lawyers, from the safe {{distance}} of Downing Street, were sometimes excessive in pressing small and trivial alterations, which the Americans after the diplomatist’s manner insisted on treating {{as if they were}} not small but great. The sharp corner in the London cabinet was the more serious proposal, that certain rules as to the duty of neutrals should be laid down, and should be made guiding principles for the arbitrators, although the rules themselves had not been formally established when England’s alleged breaches of neutral obligation had been committed. This retro-active or ex-post-facto quality, when the cabinet considered it (March 18), gave trouble, and it was used by passionate and impolitic persons to tarnish the whole policy in this country. Much heat was evoked, for a cabinet of many talents is not always the same thing as a cabinet of plain minds. One clever man objected at large to the commission, to concession, to obtaining any principle of settlement for future contingencies. A second was violent against all such arbitration as this, and thought they had much better pay up at once and have done with it. A third clever man even let fall some high words about “national dishonour.” Granville, Argyll, Forster (the last described by a colleague as “a tower of strength”), were steadfast and unfaltering for conciliation. Mr. Gladstone agreed, but eager though he was for a settlement, he “agreed with reluctance.” Sir Roundell Palmer had now great influence with him, and Palmer had come round {{to the conclusion that the}} risk from translating retrospectively into the form of a hypothetical international convention, not existing when the events happened, a duty that we had recognised as incumbent on us under our own law, might be safely run.(262) In plain English, the adverse way of describing this peculiar substitute for a free and open arbitration, was that Great Britain owed the Americans nothing, and if she had not consented to accept a set of new-fangled rules, and to be judged retro-actively by them, she could not possibly have been made to pay anything. To this <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> was that though the rules might or might not be new-fangled as principles of international law, yet they were not new as principles of English municipal law, which, as construed by the British government itself, was coincident in substance with those rules. Was it in fact reasonable to contend that ironclads might be built in the Mersey, sent out a few miles beyond the river mouth, there armed from lighters, and sent off to bombard New York? If not, was it reasonable that England should invite the arbitrators to judge the Alabama case according to one rule in the past, and then to lay down another rule for the future? ...|$|E
