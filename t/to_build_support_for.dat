5|$|With the ALP's {{governing}} bodies unwilling to reform themselves, Whitlam worked <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> change among ordinary party members. He {{was successful in}} reducing union influence in the party, though he {{was never able to}} give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive. The Victoria branch of the party had long been a problem; its executive was far {{to the left of the}} rest of the ALP, and had little electoral success. Whitlam was able to reconstruct the Victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders, and the reconstituted state party proved essential to victory in the 1972 election.|$|E

25|$|Between 1900 and 1924, {{approximately}} 1.75 million Jews {{migrated to}} America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted {{to less than}} 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, in the USA, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of Leo Frank by a mob of prominent citizens in Marietta, Georgia in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.

While direct Soviet assistance ended with the withdrawal, the Soviet Union still supported Najibullah with economic and military aid, while the United States continued its support for the mujahideen. Throughout his tenure, he tried <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> his government. Najibullah even tried to portray his government as Islamic, and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an Islamic state and all references of communism were removed. This change, coupled with others, did not win Najibullah any significant support. With {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union in December 1991, Najibullah was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. Najibullah lived in the United Nations headquarters in Kabul until 1996, when the Taliban took Kabul. Taliban hanged his body along with his brothers from a traffic post called Ariana chowk in Kabul on September 26, 1996.|$|E
