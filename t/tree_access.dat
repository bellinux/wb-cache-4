For standard <b>tree</b> <b>access</b> — searches and traversals— changing the degree of set-associativity {{has no effect on}} performance. To explain this, we develop general stochastic access models, an adaptation of the independent reference model (IRM), and analyze the expected number of cache hits and misses incurred by these types of access. The models and analyses are accurate: we are able to exactly predict the cache performance of tree data structures. In addition, we prove why set-associativity is of little or no benefit for these types of memory access and give examples where direct-mapping performs better than set-associativity. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of Mobile IP with frequent handovers results in high handoff latencies and control overhead {{in the core}} network. Micromobility protocols like Cellular IP, Hawaii and MIPv 4 Regional Registration were developed to avoid these problems, supporting local mobility within one IP domain. Hereby, <b>tree</b> <b>access</b> topologies were considered to evaluate the protocol performance [1] [2], although meshed topologies are desired for reasons of robustness against link failures and load balancing [9]. The mentioned micromobility protocols do not use the extra links or result in a bad performance in terms of end-to-end delay. This paper proposes a new micromobility protocol for random access topologies. During handoff, a router in the access network detects if it has the function of cross-over node. Hereby, control traffic is concentrated near the involved access routers, while optimal paths in the access network are achieved. The basic concept of the protocol is presented and the handoff performance is compared to other micromobility protocols...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flash memory can be {{a viable}} {{solution}} for the future embedded systems. Embedded systems usually carry database {{as a part of}} embedded software. It is well known that flash memory is far faster than usual hard disk storages especially for read however it takes much time for flash memory to delete than to read or to write. For a database system, index tree on flash memory has been widely studied for its better performance, but there have been no standard measure for flash memory database performance. In order to find the storage access performance of index trees, we measured index <b>tree</b> <b>access</b> time. We choose B-tree, R-Tree and MR-tree for prominent index trees. We also choose hard disk and flash memory for storage devices. With several indexing profiles having different mixture of insert, search (read) and delete of indices, we measured access time performance with different combination of index tree structure and storage device. We hope our result will work as a basis for flash memory database system design and performance trimming. ...|$|E

First, we demonstrate a close variant of the splay <b>tree</b> <b>access</b> lemma [ST 85] for multi-splay trees, a lemma that implies multi-splay trees have the O(log n) runtime property, the static finger property, and the static optimality property. Then, we extend the access lemma by showing the remassing lemma, {{which is similar to}} the reweighting lemma for splay trees [Geo 04]. The remassing lemma shows that multi-splay trees satisfy the working set property and key-independent optimality, and multi-splay trees are competitive to parametrically balanced trees, as defined in [Geo 04]. Furthermore, we also prove that multi-splay trees achieve the O(log log n) -competitiveness and that sequential access in multi-splay trees costs O(n).

This result settles the lower bound question left open by Ying, Srikant and Dullerud (WiOpt 06), who showed how the sum of all the N bits can be computed using O(N N) transmissions. The same lower bound has been shown to hold for a host of other functions including majority by Dutta and Radhakrishnan (FOCS 2008). Most works on lower bounds for communication networks considered mostly the full broadcast model without using the fact that the communication in real networks is local, determined by the power of the transmitters. In fact, in full broadcast networks computing parity needs θ(N) transmissions. To obtain our lower bound we employ techniques developed by Goyal, Kindler and Saks (FOCS 05), who showed lower bounds in the full broadcast model by reducing the problem to a model of noisy decision trees. However, in order to capture the limited range of transmissions in real sensor networks, we adapt their definition of noisy decision trees and allow each node of the <b>tree</b> <b>access</b> to only a limited part of the input. Our lower bound is obtained by exploiting special properties of parity computations in such noisy decision trees. Comment: 17 page...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{introduce}} a generic security framework for public clouds called Treasure Island Security framework {{that is designed}} to address the issues related to cloud computing security and specifically key-management in untrusted domains. Nowadays many cloud structure and services are provided but as an inevitable concomitant to these new products, security issues increase rapidly. Availability, integrity of data, lack of trust, confidentiality as well as security issues are also of great importance to cloud computing users; they may be more skeptical of the cloud services when they feel that they might lose the control over their data or the structures that the cloud provided for them.   Because of deferred control of data from customers to cloud providers and unknown number of third parties in between, {{it is almost impossible to}} apply traditional security methods. We present our security framework, with distributed key and sequential addressing in a simple abstract mode with a master server and adequate number of chunk servers. We assume a fixed chunk size model for large files and sequentially distribution file system with 4 separated key to decrypt/encrypt file. After reviewing the process, we analyze the Distributed Key and Sequentially Addressing Distributed file system and it's Security Risk Model. The focus of this thesis is on increasing security in untrusted domain especially in the cloud key management in public cloud. We discuss cryptographic approaches in key-management and suggest a novel cryptographic method for public cloud's key-management system based on forward-secure public key encryption, which supports a non-interactive publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme through a <b>tree</b> <b>access</b> structure. We believe that Treasure Island Security Framework can provide an increased secure environment in untrusted domains, like public cloud, in which users can securely reconstruct their secret-keys (e. g. lost passphrases). Finally, we discuss the advantages and benefits of Cloud Computing Security Framework with Distributed Key and Sequentially Addressing Distributed file system and cryptographic approaches and how it helps to improve the security levels in cloud systems.   M.

40|$|Title page, {{table of}} {{contents}} and abstract only. The complete thesis in print form {{is available from the}} University of Adelaide Library. The proliferation of box mistletoe Amyema miquelii in eucalypt woodlands of south-eastern Australia may have resulted from the suppression of canopy fires, a reduction in herbivory by possums, and through environmental change, an improvement in conditions for mistletoe dispersal and establishment. In the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR), South Australia, box mistletoe is often seen in high numbers in pink gum Eucalyptus fasciculosa woodlands. The following dissertation investigated box mistletoe dispersal and establishment by Mistletoebirds Dicaeum hirundinaceum in a pink gum woodland. The broad aims of the study were to advance our theoretical knowledge of mistletoe dispersal ecology, to understand why pink gum woodlands are more susceptible to mistletoe infection, and {{to increase the amount of}} ecological information available to land managers. A survey of box mistletoe and its Eucalyptus hosts in reserves of the MLR region revealed that almost a third of all pink gums were infected with box mistletoe. Individual pink gums with less foliage cover surrounding their canopy were more likely to host box mistletoe, suggesting canopy access for Mistletoebirds may influence the susceptibility of pink gums to mistletoe infection. Woodland type was more influential than fragmentation and edge effects in determining mistletoe presence, indicating a variation in host specificity across Eucalyptus species. The results of this survey indicated that further examination was required on Mistletoebird behaviour and mistletoe establishment success. Two aspects of Mistletoe bird ecology were examined: the influence of their movement patterns on the spatial dynamics of mistletoe dispersal, and their foraging behaviour. Mistletoebirds had home ranges of around 20 ha, and used small core areas (1 ha) of high mistletoe infestation more frequently than areas with lower mistletoe abundance. Modelling of mistletoe seed shadows indicated that the majority of mistletoe seeds (approx. 70 %) would be deposited within 100 m of a parent plant. Consistent with this, seed rain modelling showed that mistletoe seed rain was aggregated, with birds dispersing large amounts of seed (> 66 000 / ha) in areas with higher mistletoe infestation levels. This indicated that the movements of mistletoe dispersers promote mistletoe aggregation not only at the scale of an individual tree, but also at a landscape scale. From a management perspective, the results indicated that the removal of mistletoes from single trees may have only short-term results, as reinfection from neighbouring host trees is likely. The attractiveness of pink gums to Mistletoebirds was a function of tree size, mistletoe crop size and <b>tree</b> <b>access.</b> Mistletoebirds preferred to forage in taller trees with a larger mistletoe crop size and which had greater canopy access, and Mistletoebirds most often alighted on dead pink gum when visiting a tree. The results support the notion that woodland dieback may improve conditions for mistletoe dispersal by allowing favourable habitat for Mistletoebirds, by increasing canopy access and by providing more perch sites. Dieback will also reduce mistletoe establishment, however, through a loss of suitable live host branches. The high frequency of box mistletoe infection in pink gum woodlands could also be explained by differences in establishment of box mistletoe between eucalypt species. A mistletoe establishment experiment demonstrated that establishment was significantly higher on pink gums than on E. porosa and E. camaldulensis, and that mistletoes established on pink gums were larger and had a greater number of leaves. The differences probably lay in underlying differences in host physical and chemical defences, and subsequent relative success of mistletoes to establish a functional haustorium. The dispersal syndrome of box mistletoe as described in this study is suitable and perhaps facilitated in the contemporary fragmented environment in a number of ways. These include an ability to concentrate their feeding and breeding activities in small areas of remnant vegetation, greater manoeuvrability between trees isolated by clearing, and easier access to the canopies and perch sites of individual trees in deteriorated woodlands. Priority research stemming from this study should include studies into the underlying causes of pink gum dieback, an experiment to test whether canopy die back directly results in more frequent visitation by Mistletoebirds, an examination of Mistletoebird movements in areas with low mistletoe abundance, and continued monitoring of mistletoe abundance and tree condition as established in this dissertation.
