5|$|After a {{short time}} in jail, they are {{released}} by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> help them be functional again.

5|$|Brown {{considered}} Ankylosaurus so distinct {{that he made}} it {{the type}} genus of a new family, Ankylosauridae (members of which are called ankylosaurids), typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) {{as part of the}} family. Due to the fragmentary remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Only having few, incomplete members of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>to</b> compare with, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923, Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria (members of which are called ankylosaurs or ankylosaurians), thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.|$|E
