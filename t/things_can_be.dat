There are cases where three <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> rendered impure in succession by a corpse, two of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening. And there are cases where four <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> rendered impure in succession by a corpse, three of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening.|$|E
25|$|Further, it is {{superfluous}} {{to suppose}} that what can {{be accounted for by}} a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore {{there is no need to}} suppose God's existence.|$|E

25|$|Few <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{said with}} {{certainty}} about Mahāyāna Buddhism, especially its early Indian form, {{other than that}} the Buddhism practiced in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahāyāna Buddhism. Mahāyāna {{can be described as}} a loosely bound collection of many teachings with large and expansive doctrines that are able to exist simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Such {{rules are}} another {{standard}} device in traditional linguistics; e.g. passivization in English. Much of generative grammar {{has been devoted}} to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations doesn't meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being Turing complete unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One {{might argue that}} God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{causes of}} one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the}} same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church {{regards the}} bodies of all saints as holy, made such by {{participation}} in the Holy Mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the Church. Indeed, that persons and physical <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made holy is a cornerstone {{of the doctrine of}} the Incarnation, made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' relics through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since Biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{different}} causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is pica {{as a result of}} social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in pica.|$|E

A note is present describing how the waters of the stream were very sweet, but stained the teeth a sickly yellow. This note is probably the first known text referring to the drinking water, found primarily around and of Mount Meru, which has a high content of fluorine and causes a yellow-brown stain to the incisors which cannot be removed.|$|E

[...] This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'. Rooksby interpreted {{the meaning of the}} song in different ways to different people. He said that for women who were really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that {{they would be able to}} re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again. For the boys, the song presented a narcissistic image of them making the girl forget her past encounters and enjoy the sexual act as if for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Frank Langella {{was cast}} as Louis Zabel. His death [...] "ultimately leads the {{characters}} {{to discover the}} shady practices" [...] of James's bank. Susan Sarandon portrays Sylvia Moore, Jacob's real-estate agent mother who is just as consumed by greed as Gekko is, but in a different sense. Audrey, a [...] "tough, intelligent trader in the Wall Street trenches", is portrayed by Vanessa Ferlito. John Buffalo Mailer plays Jacob's Long Island financier friend, Robby and Eli Wallach plays the part of Jules Steinhardt, a Churchill Schwartz top executive and Wall Street patriarch who considers the current economic climate {{to be like the}} 1929 stock market crash. Pressman deemed the actor's role as the [...] "crier of doom," [...] who, [...] "reveals just how much more devastating <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> today."

500|$|Later {{historian}}s, however, took Gibbon's emphases even further. As Marxist historian G.E.M. de Ste. Croix {{put it in}} 1954, [...] "The so-called Great Persecution {{has been}} exaggerated in the Christian tradition to an extent which even Gibbon did not fully appreciate." [...] In 1972, the ecclesiastical Protestant historian Hermann Dörries was embarrassed to admit to his colleagues that his sympathies lay with the Christians rather than their persecutors. W.H.C. Frend guesses that 3,0003,500 Christians {{were killed in the}} persecution. Although the number of verifiably true martyrs' tales has fallen, and estimates of the total casualty rate have been reduced, some modern writers are less skeptical than Gibbon of the severity of the persecution. As the author Stephen Williams [...] wrote in 1985, [...] "even allowing a margin for invention, what remains is terrible enough. Unlike Gibbon, we live in an age which has experienced similar things, and knows how unsound is that civilised smile of incredulity at such reports. <b>Things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be,</b> have been, every bit as bad as our worst imaginings." ...|$|E

500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great <b>things</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot longer than he was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|E
