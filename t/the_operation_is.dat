5|$|A small {{detachment}} of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the bunker. He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the bunker. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely malnourished and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened on}} 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group {{landed on the}} small island of Tarakan off {{the east coast of}} Borneo. The goal of this operation was to secure the island's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan. While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> generally considered to have not been worthwhile.|$|E

50|$|A year later, on Friday 30 January 1998 <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>were</b> sold to Blazefield Holdings. In November 2003 <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>were</b> sold to Cavalier Contracts Limited of Long Sutton, Lincolnshire.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 September 1961, {{the most}} obvious example of the {{transition}} from peacekeeping to peace enforcement occurred when the local ONUC leadership launched [...] "Operation Morthor". <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> {{meant to be a}} stepped up version of <b>the</b> earlier <b>Operation</b> Rumpunch. It still remains uncertain how <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> planned. It has been said that Hammarskjöld did not know <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> happening- however, {{it is now clear that}} Hammarskjöld had prior knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|R

5|$|Though Murali {{does his}} best to cure Venu, Seetha is worried that Murali might take revenge on her by not {{providing}} proper treatment to Venu, who in the meantime, learms of Murali and Seetha's love. Venu requests Murali to marry Seetha in case <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> unsuccessful as he does not wish for his wife to become a widow. Seetha becomes infuriated when she discovers Venu's request and tells Murali that if Venu dies, she would die as well. Murali promises Seetha that he will save Venu {{even if he has}} to risk his own life on the line.|$|E
5|$|Two years {{pass and}} couple have their first child. Their family {{physician}} offers {{to perform an}} operation to restore May's sight. Despite Frank's worries that his wife will not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child {{is so strong that}} she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> Biblical figure Nachshon Ben Aminadav, {{who was the}} first to wade into the Red Sea when the Hebrews escaped from slavery in Egypt. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> {{commanded}} by Shimon Avidan.|$|R
5000|$|... 65 Armoured {{regiment}}-with T-72 tanks, {{played a}} major role in <b>the</b> <b>operations.</b> <b>The</b> regiment <b>was</b> deployed in all parts of the island where <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>were</b> taking place.|$|R
50|$|Three old tankers {{were quickly}} {{prepared}} for <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> under <b>the</b> command of Augustus Agar. Although <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> started several times each attack was thwarted by bad weather, unreliable ships and finally, by the command ship hitting a mine. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> eventually called off.|$|R
5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> complete, Heiter {{attempts}} to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating {{him with a}} crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter comes {{up with an idea}} to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. While the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} moving oil {{off of a}} tanker is similar to loading, but has some key differences. The first step in <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> {{following}} the same pretransfer procedures as used in loading. When the transfer begins, it is the ship's cargo pumps {{that are used to}} move the product ashore. As in loading, the transfer starts at low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are secure. Then a steady pressure is achieved and held during the operation. While pumping, tank levels are carefully watched and key locations, such as the connection at the cargo manifold and the ship's pumproom are constantly monitored. Under the direction of the person in charge, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the receiving facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.|$|E
50|$|Rashidian's main {{contributions}} to <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>were</b> his encouragement of the Shah's sister, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, to obtain her brother's {{approval of the}} plan, and acting as a liaison between the SIS/CIA team and the Shah once <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> underway.|$|R
50|$|<b>Operation</b> RY <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Japanese plan {{to invade}} and occupy Nauru and Ocean {{islands in the}} south Pacific during the Pacific {{conflict}} of World War II. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> originally set to be executed in May 1942 immediately following Operation MO and before Operation MI, {{which resulted in the}} Battle of Midway. The primary reason for <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> to exploit <b>the</b> islands' supplies of phosphate. After a postponement due to interference by enemy forces, <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> completed in August 1942.|$|R

5|$|Three {{years after}} Rainbow Program's deactivation, {{there is a}} {{resurgence}} of terrorist activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, yet they are causing chaos across the world. To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett). Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> a massive success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks and uncertainties. Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission – to hunt down the leader of their enemy – and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.|$|E
5|$|Chloe {{takes over}} full {{custody of her}} {{daughter}} from Billy; Delia is later diagnosed with leukemia, and Billy's bone marrow donation saves her life. During this trying time, Chloe reconnects with Kevin, and they become engaged following Delia's recovery. Mob princess Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo) arrives in town and develops a crush on Kevin. Her father Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr) blackmails Kevin into leaving Chloe at the altar and marry Angelina, which he does. Once Angelina leaves town, Chloe and Kevin marry and resume their courtship. The couple join forces with Adam (Michael Muhney) and Chelsea Newman (Melissa Claire Egan) to start a fashion website entitled TagNGrab. The site ends unsuccessfully, leaving Chloe and Kevin in need of money. In a Bonnie and Clyde themed story arc, they steal money to save their house. Their marriage flounders as Kevin continues to steal and lets Chloe spend a night in jail for his crime, and they decide to get a divorce, which particularly affects Delia who adored her stepfather. During this period Chloe develops a fashion line for Jabot's fashion division with her best friend, Chelsea. Months later, Chloe and Kevin decide to start over and begin dating again. On the night of Delia's performance in a play, Billy leaves Delia and her dog, Dash, alone in his car while purchasing ice-cream. Dash runs off, causing Delia to run after him. Delia is struck down by a car believed {{to be driven by}} Adam, before being rushed to the hospital and dying of her injuries. When she learns of Delia's death from Billy at the hospital, Chloe breaks down and begins lashing out emotionally at Billy and everyone around her. Chloe decides to honor Delia by donating her corneas to Adam's son, Connor, who needs a transplant to save his eyesight. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> successful and Connor's vision is restored.|$|E

50|$|The main {{components}} of <b>the</b> pumping <b>operation</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> river inlet, basement and chamber, {{and the control}} room. <b>The</b> <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> computer controlled allowing the station to function unmanned.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} planned {{with another}} <b>operation</b> to capture <b>the</b> Åland Islands (Tanne West), {{which was not}} carried out both because the units reserved for <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>were</b> already deployed to the Eastern Front and because Sweden had warned against operations in Åland.|$|R
