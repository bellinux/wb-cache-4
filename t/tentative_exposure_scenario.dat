30|$|The new {{requirements}} concerning {{communication in}} the supply chain and downstream user compliance are sources of non-compliance with REACH (see a non-exhaustive summary in column 3 of Additional file 4). As a rule, the attached <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> are neither available in a harmonised and structured format nor aggregated into predictive descriptions that are representative {{for the majority of}} workplaces at the moment. These problems clearly show the need to create a common format for the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> and to clearly define and structure the relevant information that has to be transferred from the CSR to the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> annexed to the SDS. In addition, even though it is legally acceptable to attach all <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> (see column 2 of Additional file 4), recipients would benefit more if suppliers provided only those <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> relevant to the recipient.|$|R
40|$|The new European {{chemicals}} legislation REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and {{restriction of}} Chemicals) requires {{the development of}} <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> describing the conditions and risk management measures needed for the safe use of chemicals. Such <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> should integrate considerations of both {{human health and the}} environment. Specific aspects are relevant for worker exposure. Gathering information on the uses of the chemical is an important step in developing an <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenario.</b> In-house information at manufacturers is an important source. Downstream users can contribute information through direct contact or through their associations. Relatively simple approaches (Tier 1 tools, such as the ECETOC Targeted Risk Assessment and the model EASE) can be used to develop broad <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> that cover many use situations. These approaches rely on the categorisation of just a few determinants, including {{only a small number of}} risk management measures. Such approaches have a limited discriminatory power and are rather conservative. When the hazard of the substance or the complexity of the exposure situation require a more in-depth approach, further development of the <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> with Tier 2 approaches is needed. Measured data sets of worker exposure are very valuable in a Tier 2 approach. Some downstream user associations have attempted to build <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> based on measured data sets. Generic Tier 2 tools for developing <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> do not exist yet. To enable efficient development of the worker exposure part of <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> a further development of Tier 1 and Tier 2 tools is needed. Special attention should be given to user friendliness and to the validity (boundaries) of the approaches. The development of standard worker exposure descriptions or full <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scenarios</b> by downstream user branches in cooperation with manufacturers and importers is recommended. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the recipient, {{be it the}} {{formulator}} or the end user, has to check whether he complies with the conditions {{set out in the}} <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> received with the substance. This is especially important in cases downstream users receive a generic <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> and need to decide whether this is sufficient for a specific workplace. With respect to REACH, they are obliged to apply, as a minimum, the conditions of the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> communicated to them. With respect to worker legislation, downstream users have to identify further workplace-specific conditions and hazards in their risk assessment. It is essential that inadequate <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> are amended to enhance their value to users of that information. In order to achieve this, recipients need to give feedback to their supplier(s) on the appropriateness of RMM, occupational conditions and process parameters as well as the readability of the eSDS. The quality of the CSR, especially the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios,</b> will improve when the knowledge of end users is fully integrated to ensure relevance of this information. For example, do <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> point to practical and relevant control measures, or do they point to measures that are potentially in conflict with other elements of health and safety legislation? REACH provides two mechanisms to address the appropriateness of exposure scenarios: the option to make details of a downstream use known to the registrant to enable him to prepare appropriate <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> (articles 37 (2) and (3)) or the option of upstream communication of inappropriate RMM in received <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> (Article 34).|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{it should}} be {{examined}} to what extent a wider harmonisation of the format in chapters 1 to 16 and of <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> is possible.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the process and challenges in building <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> for engineered nanomaterials (ENM), using an <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> format similar to that used for the European Chemicals regulation (REACH). Over 60 <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> were developed based on information from publicly available sources (literature, books, and reports), publicly available exposure estimation models, occupational sampling campaign data from partnering institutions, and industrial partners regarding their own facilities. The primary focus was on carbon-based nanomaterials, nano-silver (nano-Ag) and nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO 2), and included occupational and consumer uses of these materials with consideration of the associated environmental release. The process of building <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> illustrated the availability and limitations of existing information and exposure assessment tools for characterizing exposure to ENM, particularly as it relates to risk assessment. This article describes the gaps in the information reviewed, recommends future areas of ENM exposure research, and proposes types of information that should, at a minimum, be included when reporting the results of such research, so that the information is useful in a wider context.

A multi-metric exposure assessment approach was followed and a decision logic was developed to afford analysis of all results in concert. The overall evaluation was classified by categories of likelihood of exposure. At task level about 53 % showed increased particle number or surface area concentration compared to ‘‘background’’ level, whereas 72 % of the TEM samples revealed an indication that NOAA were present in the workplace. For 54 out of the 120 task-based <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios,</b> an overall evaluation could be made based on all parameters of the decision logic.

30|$|The safety {{data sheet}} (SDS) shall enable the {{recipient}} to take the necessary measures to protect the health of workers and the environment. Under current health and safety legislation the SDS is the main information source for employers undertaking risk assessment involving hazardous substances. The legal obligations of article 37 (7) of REACH require those who prepare a CSR to place the relevant <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> in an annex to the SDS. This SDS is called extended {{safety data sheet}} (eSDS). The (e)SDS links legislations of placing chemicals {{on the market and}} worker protection. A CSR has to be provided for specific registered substances only; however, in workplaces, mixtures of substances are commonly used [22]. Therefore, most employers will be confronted with <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> that apply only for a minority of their workplace chemicals. It is the formulator as the first downstream user who mainly has {{to deal with the problem}} of utilising the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> provided in the eSDS, and to consolidate them along with relevant information into SDSs for their products. <b>Exposure</b> <b>scenarios,</b> especially those for the workplace, are likely to be numerous and specific to bespoke processes and business practices. For a widely used solvent with for example 10 identified uses often as many as 80 different contributing <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> are compiled. Many of these <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> may be quite similar and differ only in minor details. It is difficult to consolidate all of this information into a handful of relevant specifications for safe handling as required in Sections 7 and 8 of the SDS. This is an important issue as the SDS is intended to be a clear and concise document, which takes into account the specific needs and knowledge of the user group.|$|R

One major aspect mainly neglected in hazard identification is a time-shifted <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario.</b> From our experiments, it is evident that effects at different life stages could be synergistic and, hence, increase the risk. This especially concerns uni- and semivoltine macroinvertebrates, which spend long periods with consecutive pesticide exposure in a respective environment.

The kinetics of addud formation and removal is complex and depends on the processes involved in erythrocyte removal, adduct stability, and the duration and extent of exposure.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is intended to}} be used as guidance in the REACH exposure evaluation (MSauthorities and ECHA) such as completeness and consistency checks in the substance evaluationand dossier evaluation processes. The checklist is not necessarily complete; there may also beother relevant issues {{to be taken into account}} during substance evaluation and dossier compliancechecks. This checklist will be updated when necessary, based on the experience gained. The{{document is}} focusing mainly on human health issues (workers and consumers), but it may also beutilized, for general issues, in the environmental exposure checks. The <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> is a new concept in the REACH regulation and is one of the key elements in REACH for ensuring a high level of protection of human health and environment. REACH defines <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> as a set of conditions that describe how the substance is manufactured or used during its life-cycle and how the manufacturer or importer controls, or recommends others to control exposures of humans and the environment. <b>Exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> has to be established forsubstances which are manufactured or imported in quantities over 10 tons per year and which are classified as dangerous or as PBT/vPvB. In addition, <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> is needed also in caseswhere exposure information is used as a basis for waiving certain animal tests specified in REACH. The first REACH <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> were developed by registrants during the 1 st registration phase in 2010. So far, some experience of <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> has been gained from dossier compliance checks (ES in CSR), substance evaluations (ES in CSR) as well as from the downstream user sites, when they receive extended safety data sheets (eSDS). The experience gained indicates clearly that there is room for improvement both in the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> in the chemical safetyreports and in the annexes of the SDSs. Guidance documents, various IT tools and ES formats have been developed by ECHA and industrialassociations such as CEFIC. However, these may be considered rather complicated, and thus notalways helpful enough. The specific aims of this project were: To learn more about the format and content of ESs, including the use descriptor system. To check to what extent ECHA’s guidance has been exploited in the building of ESs. To obtain experience of the quality /challenges in ESs. To identify strengths and weaknesses in building of ESs (e. g. the usability and effectiveness ofrisk management measures). To develop instructions or recommendations for authorities to be used eg. in the substanceevaluation process.
