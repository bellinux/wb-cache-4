5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E
5|$|The oblique roof {{covering}} the eastern {{facade of the}} Chiayi Station features a high-tech image. The generator room is decorated with horizontal shutters that reflect a minimalist style. The columns and truss system in the station imitate trees; as they extend toward {{the outside of the}} building, the artificial elements are integrated into nature. When night falls, the ceiling is lit with thousands of lights over the truss system, resembling a starry night over <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. <b>The</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E

There, out in the Big River, {{in the midst of}} the Black Shadows, was {{something}} which looked like <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree. But instead of moving down the river, as <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree would if it were floating, this was coming straight across the river as if it were swimming.

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} feeds {{on a wide}} range of prey, {{particularly}} insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines.|$|E
25|$|The pagan sacrifices, {{known as}} blót, were {{seasonal}} celebrations where gifts were offered to appropriate gods and {{attempts were made}} to forecast what the coming season would be like. Similar events were sometimes convened in times of crisis, for much the same reasons. The sacrifices, consisting of gold, weapons, animals, and even human beings, were hung on <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> holy tree.|$|E
25|$|Every ninth {{year there}} is a blót of nine days, a common feast for {{everyone}} in Sweden. Then they sacrifice nine males of each species, even men, and the bodies are hung from <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grove near the temple. No one is exempt from this blót and everyone sends gifts to the shrine, even the kings. Those who are Christian {{have to pay a}} fee not {{to take part in the}} blót.|$|E

25|$|While {{subnetting}} {{may improve}} network performance in an organizational network, it increases routing complexity, since each locally connected subnet must {{be represented by}} a separate entry in the routing tables of each connected router. However, by careful design of the network, routes to collections of more distant subnets within <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree-hierarchy can be aggregated by single routes. Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) functionality in commercial routers made the introduction of CIDR seamless across the Internet and in enterprise networks.|$|E

When Agne was fast asleep, Skjalf took a rope which she {{attached}} to the torc. Then she had her men remove the tent, and she threw the rope over a bough. Then she told her men to pull the rope and they hanged Agne avenging Skjalf's father. Skjalf and her men ran to the ships and escaped to Finland, leaving her sons behind.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue jay}} mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and {{occasionally}} small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes hawks insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays {{are known to}} hide nuts for later consumption. It builds an open cup nest in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.|$|E

25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} {{that was used}} in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen. The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman, who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the Tyrannosaurus fight while Ann watches from <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a Stegosaurus.|$|E

500|$|Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, stated a {{positive}} review of Dragonlance Chronicles, remarking that Dragons of Autumn Twilight is still widely read, although {{he noted the}} clichés of the series: [...] "In Dragons Of Autumn Twilight, the adventurers meet up in a tavern—even {{if it is a}} tavern that’s nestled in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant tree, something my 12-year-old self thought was super cool.

500|$|The nest {{is built}} {{in late summer}} by the female in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{deciduous}} shrub or tree at a height of up to [...] The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the female works in 10–40minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass. The inside diameter of the finished nest is about [...] The rim is reinforced with bark bound by spiderwebs and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail.

500|$|When it {{was still}} {{occupied}}, the citadel was divided in three districts or mahallas: {{from east to west}} the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was occupied by notable families; the Takya district was named after the homes of dervishes, which are called takyas; and the Topkhana district housed craftsmen and farmers. A 1920 inventory showed that at that time the citadel was divided into 506 house plots. Since then the number of houses and inhabitants has gradually declined. For example, in 1984 4,466 people lived in 375 houses, whereas a 1995 census showed that the citadel had only 1,631 inhabitants living in 247 houses. Until the opening-up of the main north–south thoroughfare, the streets on the citadel mound radiated outward from the southern gate like <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree. Streets were between [...] wide and ranged in length from [...] for major alleyways to [...] for cul-de-sacs.|$|E
500|$|The black-throated gray warbler (Setophaga nigrescens) is a {{passerine}} bird of the New World warbler family Parulidae. It is [...] {{long and}} has gray and white plumage with black markings. The male has the bold black throat of its name, and black stripes on its head, {{as well as}} black streaks on its flanks; the female is a paler version of the male, with a white throat and less distinct black markings on the flanks and wings. It breeds in western North America from British Columbia to New Mexico, and winters in Mexico and the southwestern United States. The habitats it prefers are coniferous and mixed forests and scrubland, especially those with pinyon pines, junipers, sagebrush, and oaks. Its nest is an open cup of plant fibers lined with feathers, built a few metres from the ground in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree or shrub. Three to five eggs are laid, and young are fed by both parents. Common in its breeding range, {{it does not seem}} to be seriously threatened by human activities, unlike many migratory warblers.|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis pairs up {{in spring}} and breeds in huge colonies, often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as {{suitable}} foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material. Anywhere from one to five eggs are typically laid, {{with two or three}} being the most common. The eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure [...] and weigh on average [...] Clutch sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are no statistically significant differences in the fledging rate of both colonies. Throughout the mating and incubation period, the male undergoes a period of starvation to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food. In the 2006 breeding season, a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other American white ibises—the first time the behavior has been documented for this species.|$|E
