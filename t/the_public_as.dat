5|$|By 1983 {{the museum}} was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and {{approached}} engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors.

5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s.

5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>as</b> part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, {{all of which were}} built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E

Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None of the rooms are open to <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>as</b> state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E
