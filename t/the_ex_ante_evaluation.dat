40|$|Psychometrics {{questions}} {{the use of}} dichotomous decisions. For these reasons, De Los Reyes and Wang (2012) favour a continuous funding decision system, in which the funded percentage of a requested grant sum is coupled to the ratings that a proposal receives in <b>the</b> <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> peer <b>evaluation.</b> In contrast to the ‘winner takes all’ philosophy in a dichotomous funding decision system, a continuous system takes the low reliability of peer review ratings into account. Funding decisions are mostly based on peer review rating systems that have rather low inter-rater reliability. This article aims to use psychometrics to simulate the two funding decision systems, to compare them to the funding decision system implemented by a real funding organization, and with this, to investigate {{for the first time}} the effects of measurement errors on funding decisions. We used peer review data from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (N[*]=[*] 8, 496 proposals), which obviously implements a hybrid funding decision system. The approval rate at FWF is 44. 5 %; our findings show that the approval rate would be 32. 1 % using a purely dichotomous system and 58. 4 % using a continuous funding decision system. As the funded percentage of a proposal’s requested grant sum increases with increasing mean <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> peer <b>evaluation</b> of a proposal (r[*]=[*] 0. 23), the FWF also shows elements of a continuous funding decision system.

Instead of following the traditional continuous approach (Hausman 1981, 1985 a, and 1985 b), we estimate the direct utility function using the methodology proposed by Van Soest (1995). Our data come from a sample of Spanish individuals in the 1995 wave of the EC Household Panel.

Based on interviews a quick scan is made in terms of their Willingness to Participate (WTP). We find that on long term goals, a positive WTP and a high degree of consent are the case.

The paper concludes with the application of the framework to two illustrative case-studies one relating to a collaborative company-university project and one relating to a university only research centre. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{methods for}} evaluating the impacts of social programs prior to their implementation. <b>Ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> is useful for designing programs that achieve some optimality criteria, such as maximizing impact for a given cost. This paper illustrates the use of behavioral models in predicting the impacts of hypothetical programs {{in a way that}} is not functional form dependent. Among the programs considered are wage subsidy pro-grams, conditional cash transfer programs, and income support programs. In some cases, the behavioral model justifies a completely nonparametric estimation strategy, even when there is no direct variation in the policy instrument. In other cases, stronger assumptions are required to evaluate a program <b>ex</b> <b>ante.</b> We illustrate <b>the</b> application of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods using data from the PROGRESA school subsidy randomized experiment in Mex-ico.

For boys, the predicted impacts tend to overstate the actual impacts. The ex-ante evaluation method is also used to predict the effects of counterfactal programs that include changes to the subsidy schedule and an unconditional income transfer. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> {{environmental}} <b>evaluation</b> {{of farming}} systems is increasingly demanded when proposing new developments of animal farming systems. Modelling is a promising approach {{to reduce the}} cost and the delay in studying the relationship between farming management and risky emissions. The simulation of decision is essential to better analyze <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> changes in farm management, but is rarely considered in environmental models. MELODIE simulates the flows of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, zinc and water within the whole pig and dairy farm over the long term. MELODIE upscales dynamic models developed at the field or animal scale by considering the management of the whole farm system coherently with the livestock farming system. The model is structured according to an ontology of agricultural production systems to represent the interactions between the biotechnical system and the decision system. The biotechnical module simulates the nutrient flows at a daily time step for each entity of the sub-models (soil/crop, animal and manure processes). MELODIE represents decisions at two time scales: every year, for drawing annual activity plans and every day for the context-dependent application of this plan. Thanks to the interactions between the biotechnical system and the decision system at different time scales, MELODIE is able to run consistently under different long-term climate series. The goal is to study the emerging properties of the system. Besides, because the nutrient flows within the farm are dynamically simulated, it is possible to study both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environmental risks. This approach enables a better understanding of variability in the farming system according to climate. MELODIE is intended for use in research, not as a decision support system for farm management. It is a framework for virtual experimentation on animal farming systems, and could be extended to deal with other issues than nutrient flows...|$|R

And how to make sure that knowledge users are involved in the research program in a meaningful way? The aim {{of this article is to}} explore <b>the</b> possibilities for <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> of public-private research programs in a systematic comparison of 37 Dutch programs funded by the 'Investment Grants for Knowledge Infrastructure' (Besluit Subsidies Investeringen Kennisinfrastructuur) in 2004. Our research question is as follows: to what extent can involvement and commitment of knowledge users in the stage of drawing up the program proposal serve as a predictor of their later involvement and financial contribution? Using available archival data on the programs, we show that on average there is a close association between user involvement in the proposals of public-private research consortia and their eventual involvement during the implementation, but that there are substantial differences between plans and implementation in individual cases. Our analysis suggests that selecting consortia for funding based on their program proposals is possible and legitimate, but that strict rules are necessary to safeguard the financial contributions of knowledge users. © The Author 2014.

The most important and evident constraint when evaluating a technology {{that has not yet}} been deployed is the impossibility of using primary information to assess the behavior of the technology under farming conditions. In the case of GM crops, the best available data would be the information generated during confined field trials (CFTs), where GM varieties are tested after passing the regulatory approval process.

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICTs) have increasingly become crucial to achieving organizational and strategic goals. This {{has led to}} an ever increasing expenditure on ICT and an accompanying increasing demand to measure the business value of the IS investment. The need to evaluate investments in ICT projects is further exacerbated by the ‘productivity paradox ’ observed in these investments. Despite higher investments in ICT, the resulting business value is not easily visible. One of the most important evaluations of any project is <b>the</b> <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluation.</b> This is a type of evaluation which informs the go/no go or approval decisions of projects.

This paper explores the influence that ex ante evaluation has played in the approval for implementation of ICT projects in universities in Kenya. The theoretical framework used for this evaluation focuses on three interrelated constructs that contribute to the success of evaluation, namely; context, content and process. The context of evaluation refers to factors external and internal to the organization that influence evaluation and its management; the evaluation content refers to the subject of evaluation, the criteria used and the criteria measures; and the process of evaluation refers to the way that evaluation is carried out, the time frame and the tools and techniques used.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} an {{extensive}} {{review of literature}} and practice analysing the barriers hindering the adoptions of eGovernment services (Savoldelli, Codagnone and Misuraca, 2012), and on the measurement and evaluation of ICT impact {{in general and of}} selected public eServices, including eGovernment (Misuraca, Codagnone and Rossel, 2012). From these analyses it emerges that one of the critical factors for implementing successful eGovernment services seems to be the presence of a transparent and trustworthy policy-making process. Moreover, the lack of a structured evaluation methodology {{to assess the impact of}} eGovernment services hampers the possibility of designing and implementing valid measurement models, highlighting the need to test concepts and hypotheses underlying them at a more granular and micro level. In order to overcome such limitations, this paper provides first a comparison between selected eGovernment evaluation methodologies, and discusses their limitations with regard to the capability to capture and assess the impacts of ICT-enabled services with specific regard to the relationships with the policy-making process. Building on the findings from this comparison, the paper proposes a comprehensive methodological approach, the eGEP- 2. 0 model, to assess the impacts of ICT-enabled services in the public sector, describing how an eGovernment evaluation framework should be organized, which should be its key components and which could be the political, managerial and organizational implications for the policy-making process. Finally, in order to validate the findings of the analysis and the proposed methodological framework, the paper discusses the results of the application of such framework to <b>the</b> <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> process of the eGovernment Information and Telecommunication Programme of the Regione Emilia-Romagna in Italy, for the period 2011 - 2013, where more than 30 eGovernment services have been assessed and are being implemented following the proposed evaluation methodology.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> {{quantification}} of impactsis compulsory when {{establishing a}} Rural Development Program (RDP) in the European Union. Thus, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to learn how to perform it better. In order to this all of the European 2007 - 2013 RDPs (a total of 88) and all of their corresponding available <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> were analyzed. Results show that less than 50 % of all RDPs quantify all the impact indicators and that the most used methodology that allows the quantification of all impact indicators is Input-Output. There are two main difficulties cited for not accomplishing the impact quantification: the heterogeneity of actors and factors involved in the program impacts and the lack of needed information. These difficulties should be addressedby usingnew methods that allow approaching the complexity of the programs and by implementing a better planning that facilitatesgathering the needed information...|$|R
