60|$|So rapidly did {{the snow}} thaw that by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> camp only the shady patches were left.|$|E
60|$|The man tore {{along the}} streets to the Pacific railway station. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> it we had distanced the sightseers, though some of them gave chase. My {{policeman}} got out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody fired a Slem-ray after him, but it missed. The horses {{carried him}} out of the {{building}} and onto the grounds. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the exit the cart was half way to the park." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> house, {{that black}} rascal {{will have the}} mad Virginian upon us. By my soul I would rather meet fifty Cowboys than that single man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{be pretty}} dark by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> Firefly Lake," [...] said Snap, {{and he was}} right. It was cloudy too, and a stiff breeze from the east had begun to blow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some miles below, near {{a second}} lake. I'm afraid we can't make it this trip. It will be dark by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> camp. We'll just mark {{the spot and}} come back to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|The next instant {{we were on}} the street. Arrests in Darbyville were rare, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> {{the jail}} we had a goodly {{following}} of boys and idle men, all anxious to know what was up.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} enough {{when we started}} to make it no easy matter to find our way across the moors, but as we {{advanced}} it grew lighter and lighter, until by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Fullarton's cabin it was broad daylight.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we didn't {{tumble to}} the roof," [...] said the girl; [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> {{here we were}} {{floating}} very slowly, and I'm almost sure we could float down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the air all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{two hours}} we climbed, and then, {{at a point}} close to timber-line, I reluctantly halted. [...] "We must turn here," [...] I said regretfully. [...] "It will be dark by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{women were}} stolen," [...] he said. [...] "If you want ever {{to see them}} again, come quickly and follow me. If we do not hurry the Cowrie will be {{standing}} out to sea by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> her anchorage." ...|$|R
6000|$|Why, hang it, {{it occurs}} to me that by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> New York you Twichells will be invading Europe and once more we shall miss the connection. This is {{thoroughly}} exasperating. Aren't we ever going to meet again? ...|$|R
60|$|From Axminster to Combe Regis {{the line}} runs through country as {{attractive}} as any {{that can be}} found in the island, and the train, as if in appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. It was late afternoon by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> our destination.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{great deal}} more like Aunt Melissa," [...] answers Frank. [...] "The air felt so raw and chilly by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the pier, that she {{declared}} the baby would perish if it was taken to the beach. Besides, nothing would persuade her that Nantasket Beach was at all different from Liverpool Wharf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{the captain}} had old-fashioned prejudices against antiseptics. He always used {{molasses}} for fresh wound-dressings. I lay in my bunk many weary weeks--we had a long passage--and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Hong Kong the thing was healed, {{there was no need}} for a shore surgeon, and I was standing my third mate's watch--we carried third mates in those days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and as soon}} as we get on a {{straight}} road I'll give them all the running they want," [...] answered Dave. [...] "I'll guarantee that by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> town they'll be just as meek as any one would want them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see why he}} doesn't answer us, if he's all right," [...] was the {{unsatisfactory}} reply. [...] "Come on, or {{the storm}} will overtake us before we get down from the mountain and we'll be soaked by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither Russia nor her agents can {{interfere}} with us on neutral soil," [...] he remarked. [...] "I wish, Reist, that you had let me send for my bag. I shall be a very dilapidated object by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> frontier." ...|$|R
60|$|The descent {{was very}} laborious, {{especially}} through the several miles of bush and rock which lie below the summit: so that, although we started at 10 a.m., {{it was dark}} by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Buckeem, where we found two lame coolies, whom we had left on our way up, and who were keeping up a glorious fire for our reception.|$|E
6000|$|Marble {{took the}} idea, and seemed pleased with it, though he affirmed {{that there could}} be no such thing as acting lawyer without lying a little, and that [...] "the truth was too good for one of your bloody usurers." [...] I got him trained, however, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the door; and we alighted as well {{prepared}} for our task as could be expected.|$|E
60|$|I was abashed; I was humiliated; I was nigh to tears. I choked it all down, and I strode on beside her, my rage {{smouldering}} within me. But it was flaring {{up again}} by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> {{the house with}} no more words spoken between us. She went to her room without another glance at me, and I repaired straight in quest of Fifanti.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold fast!" [...] {{commanded}} the grizzled engineer, opening the throttle. [...] "When she's under way, I'll talk to you, {{and unless you}} satisfy me, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> Vancouver there won't be much of you left {{for the police to}} take charge of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid you'll {{be tired}} of riding by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> San Francisco," [...] said Earl, who, nevertheless, also enjoyed the journey. [...] "This {{is only a}} little trip of six or seven hours. The next {{will be one of}} many days and nights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we do as}} well right {{straight}} through," [...] he said, as he and Andy talked it over {{on their}} way to Lehighton and Mauch Chunk, [...] "we will have quite an amount to place to our credit in the bank by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> New York again." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was almost}} exhausted, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> camp, just at dark, I was wholly exhausted. My voice had sunk to a whisper, {{a fact that}} occasioned R.C. some concern until I could explain. Undoubtedly this was the hardest day's work I had done since my lion hunting with Buffalo Jones. It did not {{surprise}} me that next day I had to forget my crosscut saw exercise.|$|E
60|$|The rumour of our coming sped {{through the}} streets ahead of us, {{and out of the}} houses poured the townsfolk to watch our passage and to point me out one to another with many whisperings and solemn head-waggings. And the farther we advanced, the greater was the concourse, until by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the square before the Communal Palace we found there what {{amounted}} to a mob awaiting us.|$|E
60|$|This, however, so retarded our departure, {{that night}} had fallen by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Blois. Still our journey {{had been a}} passing swift one. We had left Paris on a Monday, the fourth of June--I have good cause to remember, since on that day I entered both upon my thirty-second year and my altered fortunes; {{on the evening of}} Wednesday we reached Blois, having covered a {{distance}} of forty-three leagues in less than three days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I do {{not doubt}} that; but I have heard, before now, of {{headwinds}} springing up, and boats {{not being able}} to make their passage, and being blown off land; and I am not fond of fasting. I daresay you won't mind eating, tomorrow, anything that is not consumed by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> port." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} minister, [...] "I {{see what you}} mean." [...] He joined Colville in leaning on the parapet, and he {{looked out on the}} river as if he saw his meaning there. [...] "But by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> that point in life most of us have got the {{direction}} which Nature meant us to take, and there's no longer any need of her driving us on." ...|$|R
50|$|Starting with Archilei (1589), the treatises {{bring in}} {{a new set of}} {{expressive}} devices called graces alongside the divisions. These have a lot more rhythmic interest and are filled with affect as composers took much more interest in text portrayal. It starts with the trillo and cascate, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> Francesco Rognoni (1620) we are also told about fashionable ornaments: portar la voce, accento, tremolo, gruppo, esclamatione and intonatio.|$|R
60|$|Hans, of course, {{was much}} oppressed {{by the great}} weight of the gorilla skin, which, {{although}} it had shrunk a good deal, remained as heavy as ever. But he was a tough old fellow, and on the whole got on better than might have been expected, though by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the town he was sometimes obliged to {{follow the example of}} the god itself and help himself forward with his hands, going on all fours, as a gorilla generally does.|$|E
60|$|Well, I set {{myself to}} {{recovering}} Leo, who, to my infinite relief, I found was not dead, but only fainting, {{and in the}} end I succeeded, as I have said, and he sat up; and then I saw another dreadful thing. When we entered that awful place his curling hair had been of the ruddiest gold, now it was turning grey, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the outer air it was snow white. Besides, he looked twenty years older.|$|E
60|$|About half a {{mile from}} the gates of this kraal is a long stretch of rising ground sloping gently upwards from the road, and here the {{companies}} formed. It was a splendid sight to see them, each company about three hundred strong, charging swiftly up the rise, with flashing spears and waving plumes, to take their appointed place. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the slope twelve such companies, or in all three thousand six hundred men, had passed out and taken up their positions along the road.|$|E
60|$|I {{gave him}} a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly {{concluded}} it by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> our destination.|$|R
5000|$|Actually, the nonexistence {{of such a}} map occurs already by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> polynomials {{of degree}} four. Note that the Poisson bracket of two polynomials of degree four has degree six, so it does not exactly make sense to require a map on polynomials of degree four to respect the bracket {{condition}}. We can, however, require that the bracket condition holds when [...] and [...] have degree three. Groenewold's theorem can be stated as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{we have to}} {{hope for}} is that the capture of Rangoon, by our fleet, may lower their pride {{and bring them to}} treat for terms. It sailed nearly six weeks ago from Calcutta, and was to have been joined by one from Madras and, {{allowing}} for delays, it ought to have been at Rangoon a fortnight since, and would certainly capture the place without any difficulty. So possibly by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> Ava <b>we</b> shall find that peace has been made.|$|R
