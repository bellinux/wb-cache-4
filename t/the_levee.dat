5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced <b>the</b> <b>Levée</b> en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from <b>the</b> <b>Levée</b> en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E

Only five people stayed the first night, resulting in the organization to convert it to a family services center. Over 100families asked for food assistance. The Red Cross also set up a shelter in Houma, where 14people stayed.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E
5|$|The Vanport flood {{induced changes}} to the slough's system of levees, which were rebuilt {{and in some cases}} {{fortified}} to withstand a 100-year flood. Instead of repairing <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> along the Peninsula Canal, the city plugged it at both ends. The disaster also affected Oregon's system of higher education. After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center, set up in 1946, the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland, where it eventually became Portland State University.|$|E

5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, Hurricane Florence produced {{higher than}} normal tides, including a peak observation of 7.5feet (2.3m) {{above mean sea level}} on the Bayou Benvenue to the east of New Orleans. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1inch (25mm) to a maximum of 4.05inches (103mm) at Watson. Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64mph (103km/h) at an automatic Coast Guard Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish. Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, and Saint Tammany Parishes. On Grand Isle, strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40feet (12.2m) of beach. The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix. The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in Delacroix; it was quickly repaired with flooding from <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> being pumped to the gulf. Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000people without power for some period of time during the storm. The power outages were short-lived, with about 6,900left without power by the day after the hurricane. Damage in the state was fairly minor, totaling about $2.5million (1988USD, $4.4million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s {{the defence}} bases in Wagga Wagga again became an {{important}} part of the city. The Army camp at Kapooka was reopened as a recruit training centre from 1951, a role it maintains to this day. RAAF Base Wagga at Forest Hill also expanded, with training of defence force aircraft technicians there from 1969. After a series of major floods in the early 1950s, the City Council protected the city area on the south flood plain through construction of a levee, completed in 1962. <b>The</b> <b>levee</b> was designed to provide protection from floods at levels expected once every one hundred years. North Wagga Wagga was initially excluded from protection however by 1982 another levee was constructed to protect the village, although at a lower standard.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 {{and again}} in 1947, devastating hurricanes struck the New Orleans area, causing {{millions}} of dollars in property damage and killing hundreds of residents. Water overtopped and breached <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> along <b>the</b> outfall canals and the Sewerage and Water Board and <b>the</b> Orleans <b>Levee</b> District raised <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> an estimated three feet after those hurricanes. However, some of these levees had subsided by as much as 10 ft during their nearly 100-year existence.|$|R

An {{estimated}} 160,000 residences were left without power due to Georges and severe beach erosion took place due to the slow movement of the hurricane. Precipitation statewide peaked at 2.98in (75.69mm) in Bogalusa, and wind gusts reached 82mph (132km/h). In the wake of the hurricane, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened 67 shelters throughout the state, and covered insurance claims totalling $14,150,532, including from Puerto Rico and Mississippi. The Clinton administration appropriated $56million in disaster relief to regions in Louisiana for recovery from Tropical Storm Frances and Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|When Allison {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10houses in Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 82. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000houses in St. Tammany Parish, 80 houses in Saint Bernard Parish, {{and hundreds of}} houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800residents from their homes in East Baton Rouge Parish. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The Bogue Falaya River in Covington crested past its peak twice to near-record levels. The Amite and Comite Rivers reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> along the Bayou Manchac broke, flooding roadways and more houses. Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65million (2001USD, $84million 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|On the mainland, SR 160 {{once again}} runs atop the east levee, now 1–2 miles (1.5–3km) west of Interstate 5. The final {{bridge over the}} river is the Freeport Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west levee, where it turns south to return to SR 160 at {{the west end of}} the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5km) beyond the Freeport Bridge, SR 160 leaves <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> enters the city of Sacramento (where state {{maintenance}} and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as Freeport Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. Freeport Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a one-way pair with 21st Street with Freeport heading one-way southbound and 21st heading one-way northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way streets for traffic calming purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the one-way pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.|$|E

5|$|In New Jersey, Doria {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 54mph (87km/h) and storm tides 5.3feet (1.6m) above normal in Atlantic City. The outer bands of the storm spawned an F2 tornado near Cape May. It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971USD, $ USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47km) path. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29inches (261mm) in Little Falls. Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84inches (199mm) and Trenton with 7.55inches (192mm). The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state. The Beden Brook crested at over 5feet (1.5m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton. The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8feet (3m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The heavy rainfall overtopped <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> system in Zarephath, causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening {{in the fall of}} 1971. The rainfall also flooded two fire houses in Somerville with several feet of water, and the water treatment plant in Bridgewater Township with 18inches (457mm) of floodwaters in what was catalogued as a 50-year flood event. Following the flooding to the water treatment plant, officials raised the beams of the plant to withstand a 500-year flood event. Eleven houses experienced flooding damage in Montgomery Township. Doria killed three people and caused $138million in damage (1971USD) in the state.|$|E
