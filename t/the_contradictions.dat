5|$|While all of <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> above {{cannot be}} reconciled, the most {{probable}} dates {{that may be}} drawn from available data place Æthelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, perhaps, his marriage to Bertha at 580.

40|$|Much {{discussed}} {{in recent times}} {{is the idea of}} the knowledge society. However, on closer inspection we find that this is a highly contested concept and, moreover, it is associated with new ideologies, of which three are {{discussed in}} the article: postmodernism, neo-liberalism and third wayism. It is argued that these new ideologies are impacting on higher education, which is consequently experiencing far-reaching cultural <b>contradictions.</b> <b>The</b> article examines six of these: <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of teaching and research, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of efficiency and scholarship, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of massification and democratisation, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of management and leadership, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of opinion and knowledge, and <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of science and technology...|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} {{of all of these}} concepts together - the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>contradiction,</b> <b>the</b> pursuit of an ideal solution and the search for {{one or more of the}} principles which will overcome <b>the</b> <b>contradiction,</b> are <b>the</b> key elements in a process which is designed to help the inventor to engage in the process with purposefulness and focus.|$|R

5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> within Ramesside king {{lists and}} the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E

5|$|King Khaba is {{considered}} to be difficult to assess as a figure of ancient Egypt. His name is archaeologically well-attested by stone bowls and mud seal impressions. Khaba's reign is securely dated to the Third Dynasty. Because of <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, his exact chronological position within the dynasty remains disputed. These problems originate in part from contradictory king lists, which were all compiled long after Khaba's death, especially during the Ramesside era. It is also a matter of debate as to where Khaba might have been buried. Many Egyptologists and archaeologists propose that an unfinished step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, known as the Layer Pyramid, belongs to him. Others believe instead that his tomb is a large mastaba close to the Layer Pyramid, where numerous stone vessels bearing Khaba's serekh have been found.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E

50|$|In {{classical}} deductive logic, a set {{of statements}} is inconsistent if it contains a <b>contradiction.</b> <b>The</b> paradox then arises from <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> of <b>the</b> author's belief {{that all of the}} statements in his book are correct (1) with his belief {{that at least one of}} them is not correct (2). To resolve the paradox, one can attack either <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> between statements (1) and (2), or the inconsistency of their conjunction.|$|R

25|$|Habermas's work {{takes the}} Frankfurt School's abiding {{interests}} in rationality, the human subject, democratic socialism, and the dialectical method and overcomes {{a set of}} contradictions that always weakened critical theory: <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> between the materialist and transcendental methods, between Marxian social theory and the individualist assumptions of critical rationalism between technical and social rationalization, and between cultural and psychological phenomena {{on the one hand}} and the economic structure of society on the other.|$|E
25|$|Marx thus {{extensively}} {{relied on}} a form of dialectical analysis. This method—to know the truth by uncovering <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations {{to which they are}} linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of the dialectic (i.e. class consciousness) of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.|$|E

Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals more and more of <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> and complexities at the core of his work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
