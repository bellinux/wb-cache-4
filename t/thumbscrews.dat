5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and <b>thumbscrews.</b> A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E

25|$|In 1611, {{her father}} was working with Agostino Tassi to {{decorate}} the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia. Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved. After the rape, Artemisia continued to {{have sexual relations with}} Tassi, with the expectation {{that they were going to}} be married and with the hope to restore her dignity and her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue of this trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. During the trial, Artemisia was subjected to a gynecological examination and torture using <b>thumbscrews</b> to verify her testimony. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although they never carried out the sentence. The trial influenced the feminist view of Artemisia Gentileschi during the late twentieth century.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{sentences}} (1 a-b), from the TIME Corpus: (1) a [...] . the others [...] . bullied him into leaving the jury room. (1928) b [...] . railroads [...] . had <b>thumbscrewed</b> the mine operators into <b>thumbscrewing</b> the miners. (1928) (1 a) and (1 b) illustrate the transitive into -ing pattern, where a matrix verb selects an object and a sentential complement {{that consists of}} into and an -ing clause. The paper identifies the transitive into -ing pattern, and then turns to the OED treatment of verbs selecting it. The availability of the transitive into -ing pattern for bully is implicitly recognized in the resultative (or causative) sense 'to frighten into a certain course' (OED, s. v. bully, under sense 2) By contrast, as regards <b>thumbscrew,</b> {{the sense of the}} verb is given as 'to torture by screwing the thumbs by torture; to torture with or as with thumbscrews' (OED, s. v. <b>thumbscrew),</b> and there is no resultative sense given. The paper {{raises the question of whether}} additional resultative senses should be postulated for verbs of the type of <b>thumbscrew</b> or whether a reference to the transitive into -ing pattern might be appropriate. Using the TIME Corpus, the paper also explores the questions of how frequent unexpected or innovative resultative usages have been in recent English. Other verbs analogous to <b>thumbscrew</b> are identified. It is also observed that there are verbs converted from proper names selecting the transitive into -ing pattern. Such conversions, it is suggested, are unlikely to enter the lexicon, especially when decades old, but they are still easily interpreted in their contexts. It is suggested that a model of construction grammar is helpful in their analysis...|$|R

6000|$|Every {{person of}} sound {{education}} enjoys detective stories, {{and there are}} even several points on which they have a hearty superiority to most modern books. A detective story generally describes six living men discussing {{how it is that}} a man is dead. A modern philosophic story generally describes six dead men discussing how any man can possibly be alive. But those who have enjoyed the roman policier must have noted one thing, that when the murderer is caught he is hardly ever hanged. [...] "That," [...] says Sherlock Holmes, [...] "is the advantage of being a private detective"; after he has caught he can set free. The Christian Church can best be defined as an enormous private detective, correcting that official detective&mdash;the State. This, indeed, is one of the injustices done to historic Christianity; injustices which arise from looking at complex exceptions and not at the large and simple fact. We are constantly being told that theologians used racks and <b>thumbscrews,</b> and so they did. Theologians used racks and <b>thumbscrews</b> just as they used thimbles and three-legged stools, because everybody else used them. Christianity no more created the mediaeval tortures than it did the Chinese tortures; it inherited them from any empire as heathen as the Chinese.|$|E

50|$|The <b>thumbscrew</b> is a torture {{instrument}} {{which was}} first used in medieval Europe. It is a simple vice, sometimes with protruding studs on the interior surfaces.
