5|$|The 2009 Royal Mail {{industrial}} disputes is {{an industrial}} dispute in the United Kingdom involving Royal Mail {{and members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Communication</b> Workers Union (CWU), {{which began in the}} summer of 2009. It was the country's first industrial action involving postal workers since 2007 and came about after <b>the</b> <b>Communication</b> Workers Union accused Royal Mail of refusing to enter into dialogue regarding how the implementation of modernisation plans would affect the job security of postal workers.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines work by {{increasing}} the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, GABA, to decrease the excitability of neurons. This reduces <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect {{on many of the}} functions of the brain.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to conduct a needs {{analysis}} to identify the spoken English language <b>communication</b> needs of <b>the</b> LIDP while catering to the demands and requests of the international students. By identifying their spoken communication needs, their spoken communication skills are identified and incorporated into a proposed English language course design. Dudley-Evans and St. John‟s (1998) framework; Target Situation Analysis (TSA), Present Situation Analysis (PSA) and Learning Situation Analysis (LSA), are used in answering the two research questions. Moreover, a learning-centred course is implemented, as the learners‟ priority in acquiring the language is emphasized. This study is based on a qualitative approach which are supplemented by frequency counts from a set of questionnaire and survey checklist. The questionnaires were completed by 30 LIDP while the survey checklists were completed by 50 international students. Moreover, semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with four LIDP; the Head of the Client Services Division of the Main Library and the Head of the Library of Languages and Linguistics. Additionally, observation sessions were also conducted with four LIDP (whom were interviewed) in further verifying the derived data.

The Mexican government allocated about $ (1995USD, $ 1995 MXN, $ USD) in funds for the restoration of houses and the overall infrastructure. Officials distributed 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to hurricane victims. All sunken ships and drowned bodies were ultimately recovered by divers.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E
