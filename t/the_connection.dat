The Chrystie Street Connection was first {{proposed}} in 1947 as {{the southern end of the}} Second Avenue Subway (SAS), which would feed into the two bridges, allowing Sixth Avenue Line trains to access the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line in Brooklyn. Construction started in 1962, and the first part of <b>the</b> <b>connection,</b> including this station, opened on November 26, 1967, when the link between the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge north tracks opened. <b>The</b> <b>connection</b> was fully opened on July 1, 1968 with the opening of the 57th Street and the opening of <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> between the Sixth Avenue Line and the Williamsburg Bridge. With <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> completed, the most significant service changes ever carried out in the subway's history were introduced.|$|E

5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> on {{the regulator}} surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. <b>The</b> <b>connection</b> is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

50|$|Making <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> stiffer and {{stronger}} than the strut members means that stress response is governed by the struts. Extending dimensional scaling methods to include <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> shows that <b>the</b> mass density cost of robust connections - which scale with the strut's cross-sectional area - is low for ultralight materials, where strut diameter dominates mass density scaling. The relative density (ρ/ρs) of these materials {{is the sum of}} the relative density contribution of the strut members (ρm/ρs) and the relative density contribution of <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> (ρc/ρs). <b>The</b> strut members have a thickness t and length l. <b>The</b> <b>connections</b> transfer forces through load-bearing surface contacts, requiring that the characteristic dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> scale with <b>the</b> cross section of the attached strut members, t2, because this dimension determines the maximum stress transferrable through the joint.|$|R

5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar {{psychological}} problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the California Transportation Commission (CTC) {{approved}} shifting SR 111 {{onto the}} new SR 86 expressway {{after it was}} completed, using SR 195 to make <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> When the SR 86 expressway was fully constructed, SR 195 was {{to be removed from}} the state highway system according to state law; that expressway was finished in 2001. However, this removed <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> from the highway portion of SR 111 to the new expressway carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system. Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009, leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing that was now bypassed by the expressway. In December 2014, with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting, the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195, from the new SR 86 expressway to SR 111, to become part of SR 111. SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014.|$|E
