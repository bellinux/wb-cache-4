5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, <b>the</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible.|$|E

In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about gutting 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong motherboards and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981.

Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E

5|$|Local {{music in}} Baltimore {{can be traced}} back to 1784, when concerts were advertised in the local press. These concert {{programs}} featured compositions by locals Alexander Reinagle and Raynor Taylor, as well as European composers like Frantisek Kotzwara, Ignaz Pleyel, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, Giovanni Battista Viotti and Johann Sebastian Bach. Opera first came to Baltimore in 1752, with the performance of The Beggar's Opera by a touring company. It was soon followed by La Serva Padrona by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, the American premier of that work, and the 1772 performance of Comus by John Milton, performed by the American Company of Lewis Hallam. This was soon followed by the creation of the first theatre in Baltimore, funded by Thomas Wall and Adam Lindsay's Maryland Company of Comedians, the first resident theatrical company in the city, which had been established despite a ban on theatrical entertainment by the Continental Congress in 1774. Maryland was the only state to so openly flout the ban, giving special permission to the Maryland Company in 1781, to perform both in Baltimore and Annapolis. Shakespearean and other plays made up the repertoire, often with wide-ranging modifications, including the addition of songs. <b>The</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the Maryland Company had some trouble finding qualified musicians to play in the theatre's orchestra. The Maryland Company and the American Company performed sporadically in Baltimore until the early 1790s, when the Philadelphia Company of Alexander Reinagle and Thomas Wignell began dominating, based out of their Holliday Street Theater.|$|E
5|$|Newsweek {{verbally}} accepted Hensmann's {{offer and}} he in turn informed Murdoch, {{giving him the}} option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. <b>The</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements {{and came to a}} second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.|$|E
5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by <b>the</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said {{he did not want to}} speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.|$|E

5|$|The first Olympic {{ice hockey}} tournament {{took place at}} the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. At the time, {{organized}} international ice hockey was still relatively new. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the sport's governing body, was created on May 15, 1908, under the name Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace. At the 1914 Olympic Congress in Paris, ice hockey was added to the list of optional sports that Olympics organizers could include. The decision to include ice hockey for the 1920 Summer Olympics was made in January, three months {{before the start of the}} Games. Several occurrences led to the sport's inclusion in the programme. Five European nations had committed to participating in the tournament and <b>the</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> Antwerp's Palais de Glace stadium refused to allow the building to be used for figure skating unless ice hockey was included. The IIHF considers the 1920 tournament to be the first Ice Hockey World Championship. From then on, the two events occurred concurrently, and every Olympic tournament until 1968 is counted as the World Championship. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to play.|$|E
