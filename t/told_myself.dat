500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|Brazil played Italy in {{the final}} at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pelé scored the opening goal with a header over Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth {{finished}} by Carlos Alberto. The last goal {{of the game is}} often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pelé made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pelé received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pelé during the final, was quoted saying [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> before the game, he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else— but I was wrong".|$|E

500|$|In the 2008–09 season, Nasri {{appeared}} in only three matches {{with the national}} team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost {{a year and a}} half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." [...] The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, [...] "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> I need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story {{collection}} to Vishal Bhardwaj. He {{was intrigued by}} a four-page story's title named [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came {{to know that she}} also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It reminded me of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> to start using my legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} {{as much as}} he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself." [...] He also said that the best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it".|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca {{has also}} {{recovered}} from an eating disorder, which she developed at around {{the age of}} 18. [...] "Every time I looked in the mirror, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> 'My goodness, how fat. You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nicola Roberts is one {{fifth of}} the band Girls Aloud. During her time with the girl group, she {{struggled}} with loneliness, due to living away from home in London, busy schedule, and media criticism of her image, eventually describing her time in the band as a [...] "blur". She became exhausted and found herself with two personalities, one being a [...] "normal" [...] girl and another {{to deal with the}} celebrity lifestyle, with which she was uncomfortable. Roberts claimed that the hardest aspect of being with the group was the media attention – which would constantly pick out flaws with her image. She said she [...] "just had to harden myself to it, actually, inside, I was dying". The album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud – [...] "It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing." [...] For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: [...] "It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident. I don't know if it's good, or if I've just <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> it's good."

2500|$|Halep {{began the}} year as the Romanian No. 2, ranked No. 47 in the world, 20 places behind Sorana Cîrstea. Her first three tournaments, ASB Classic, Hobart International and Australian Open, ended in defeats. Her first major tournament {{breakthrough}} came at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in May, gaining three of the biggest victories of her career. Halep defeated two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, and two-time tournament champion and former world No. 1 Jelena Janković (but saved 2 match points) to reach the semifinals, where she was defeated soundly by eventual champion Serena Williams in straight sets. She later said that [...] "What changed was that I allowed myself to be relaxed on the court by taking the pressure off. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> to enjoy it and play with pleasure." [...] At the French Open, Halep suffered her second successive first-round exit at a Grand Slam, falling to Carla Suárez Navarro, despite taking the first set comfortably. She rebounded well, however, going on to win her first two WTA titles back-to-back, first at the Nürnberger Versicherungscup in June, where she defeated Andrea Petkovic in the final, {{and then at the}} Topshelf Open, where she defeated world No. 11 Roberta Vinci with the loss of just one game in the second round, before defeating Kirsten Flipkens in the final. She became the first Romanian tennis player to win back-to-back tournaments on different surfaces. She claimed her first Grand Slam match win of the year at Wimbledon, defeating Olga Govortsova of Belarus, before falling to Li Na in three sets. After Wimbledon, in July, Halep entered the top-30 rankings for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|In the Girls Aloud 2008 {{biography}} Roberts {{expressed an}} interest in writing and recording her own material, wanting to experiment in the studio for better understanding of the process. She then started work in the recording studio, with producers such as; Dragonette, Diplo and Joseph Mount. Roberts after a year of recording announced that she would be releasing her debut album, Cinderella's Eyes. The first single [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] had an on-sale release meaning it had little promotion beforehand and commercially it peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom but critically it garnered acclaim from critics which Roberts described as [...] "amazing". A second single [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was released shortly after and whilst gaining positive reviews it failed to make an impact commercially peaking at number 40 in the UK. The album was then released on 23 September 2011, Roberts described the album as [...] "electronically lead", and the album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud - [...] "It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing" [...] she said. For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: [...] "It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident. I don't know if it's good, or if I've just <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> it's good." [...] The album was released to universal positive reviews from critics, reviewers such as Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times, James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph, Emily Mackay of NME, Hugh Montgomery of The Independent and others hailed it as the best solo record from a member of Girls Aloud. Commercially in the United Kingdom the album peaked at number 17 whilst on the Digital charts it peaked at number 13, in Scotland it charted at number 21 whilst in Ireland it peaked at number 48. On 6 January a third single from the album was released, titled [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] the song was described as a [...] "shining example of her pop sensibilities".|$|E
