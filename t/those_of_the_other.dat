5|$|At {{some point}} in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876.

In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> items.

Any system action can decrease position values <b>of</b> some agents (<b>the</b> winners) and increase <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> (<b>the</b> losers); consequently, an action execution can create conflicts among its participants (winners and losers); arbitrary resolutions of such conflicts can prevent some agents of reaching their goals.

Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.|$|E
