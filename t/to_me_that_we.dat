500|$|The move to Los Angeles {{also meant}} a drastic price {{increase}} for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, [...] "At the time, {{the exchange rate}} between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody {{told me that the}} cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved". In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained [...] "everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. [...] It became apparent very quickly <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were no longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding {{in the middle of the}} woods".|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It was clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time}} and I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Homicide {{said the decision}} to evaluate the series after a four-episode season placed tremendous pressure {{on the staff of}} the show. Fontana said one-hour dramas need time to fully develop and allow audiences to become familiar with the characters. Fontana expressed frustration with NBC in some news interviews, claiming the networks seemed to lack the courage to either cancel or renew it: [...] "They will run it in a 10 p.m. time period for a month and then they'll kiss us goodbye. ... I'm used to this kind of treatment from NBC. I'm a little surprised they'd treat Barry Levinson the same way they'd treat me." [...] In other interviews, however, Fontana said he saw the decision as a sign of support: [...] "This is not just a casual action on NBC's part. It's a real statement <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a possibility to return." [...] Levinson said he believed [...] "four shots are better than nothing", adding: ...|$|E

[...] t is incomprehensible to me how, in this day, more than 70 years after the institution of our present federal income tax system {{with the passage of}} the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, any taxpayer of competent mentality can assert as his defense to charges of statutory willfulness the proposition that the wage he receives for his labor is not income, irrespective of a cult that says otherwise and advises the gullible to resist income tax collections. One might note in passing that this particular taxpayer, after all, was a licensed pilot for one of our major commercial airlines; he presumably was a person of at least minimum intellectual competence.|$|E

He continued to sleep at the PA's Jenin headquarters and received a salary of 1,050 NIS instead of previous 2000 NIS. Asked why he stopped fighting even {{when he did not}} receive a full pardon, Zubeidi answered [...] "because of the conflict between Fatah and Hamas. Look, it's perfectly clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> won't be able to defeat Israel. My aim was for us, by means of the resistance, to get a message out to the world.

2500|$|The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and American philanthropist Cleveland Dodge, head of {{the board}} of Robert College, wrote to Wilson asking him not to declare war on Bulgaria, saying that it would have no effect on the war, but would harm the work of American missionaries, {{educational}} institutions, and American citizens in Bulgaria and Turkey. Wilson agreed to reconsider his proposal. [...] In his final message to Congress delivered on December 4, Wilson called for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but said, [...] "The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria.

We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others."

2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now.

[...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E
