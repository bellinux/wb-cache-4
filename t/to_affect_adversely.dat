30|$|In the {{experimental}} investigations {{conducted in the}} study, it was found that, the addition of jute yarn contributes enriched results for mechanical properties of concrete composites for a particular yarn length and yarn content. More specifically, compressive, flexural, and tensile strength are found to enhance significantly for volume content of 0.1 and 0.25  % and the yarn cut length of 10 and 15  mm. However, with larger yarn length and content the mechanical properties were found <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>adversely.</b> Finally the jute yarn shows the positive contribution to minimize irregular mixing disabilities of concrete composites that creates major problem regarding fibre reinforcement. So JYRCC can be developed with locally fabricated jute yarn in Bangladesh. The least cost of jute yarn, its being renewable resources, the reduced weight of the JYRCC and the environmental compatibility would clearly show the socioeconomic viability of JYRCC. This diversified use of jute may redeem the lost glory of jute in Bangladesh.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the effect of the SARS outbreak on hospitalization for chronic ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in Taiwan. MethodsWe applied a population-based interrupted time series study design and used the time series auto-regressive integrated moving-average model to compare the actual and predicted admission rates of seven selected chronic ACSCs. The analyses were based on National Health Insurance hospital inpatient claims data from 1997 to 2003. ResultsThe impact of SARS on ACSCs after the outbreak varied among seven selected chronic conditions. Hospitalization for respiratory conditions was significantly lower than the predicted values, whereas hospitalization for diabetes was significantly higher than the predicted values after the outbreak. ConclusionAdmission rates for most ACSCs, except for diabetes, did not change in the post-SARS period. The reductions in outpatient utilization during the SARS outbreak did not appear <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>adversely</b> admissions for most ACSCs...|$|E

Marijuana smokers, both men and women, show impaired fertility, owing to defective signalling pathways, aberrant hormonal regulation, or wrong timing during embryo implantation. Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) mimic Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive principle of Cannabis sativa, by binding to both the brain-type (CB(1)) and the spleen-type (CB(2)) cannabinoid receptors. These 'endocannabinoids' exert several actions either in {{the central nervous system}} or in peripheral tissues, and are metabolised by specific enzymes that synthesise or hydrolyse them. In this review, we shall describe the elements that constitute the endocannabinoid system (ECS), in order to put in a better perspective the role of this system in the control of human fertility, both in females and males. In addition, we shall discuss the interplay between ECS, sex hormones and cytokines, which generates an endocannabinoid-hormone-cytokine array critically involved in the control of human reproduction...|$|E

Signal * coherence is shown <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>adversely</b> the resolution and detection capabilities, as vell as the bias characteristics, of all three algorithms. For linear arrays of equally-spaced sensors, the superior resolution capability of the linear predictive algorithm is demonstrated. The value of utilizing prediction elements {{in the center of}} the array to resolve very closely-spaced source bearings is demonstrated. However, the linear predictive algorithm is least capable of detecting highly coherent sources. A tradeoff is * established between resolving capability and sensitivity to finite averaging. Conditions are established which indicate which algorithm is best suited to anticipated levels of signal coherence and averaging. The estimates of source bearing produced by each algorithm are shown to be asymptotically biased. The bias produced by the classical beamformer is most severe, while the minimum energy beamformer produces the least bias. 1...|$|E

More data are needed to confirm parameters that influence clinical outcomes. Aims: The primary aim was to determine the efficacy of an oral NTHi vaccine (HI- 164 OV) in reducing the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids or hospitalisation in COPD. Secondary aims included effect on the proportion of patients experiencing such exacerbations, severity of infections and quality of life (St George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C)). Methods: This multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 21 Australian sites for 9 months in 2011. Results: Three-hundred and twenty subjects with COPD, FEV 1 H. influenzae -positive sputum sample. Subsequent exploratory analysis of patients H. influenzae -positive sputum were not protected against exacerbations by HI- 1640 V.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} is arguably {{one of the biggest}} {{problems}} that confront us today. There is ample evidence that {{climate change is}} likely <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>adversely</b> many aspects of life for all people around the world, and that existing solutions such as geoengineering might be too risky and ordinary behavioural and market solutions might not be sufficient to mitigate climate change. In this paper, we consider a new kind of solution to climate change, what we call human engineering, which involves biomedical modifications of humans so that they can mitigate and/or adapt to climate change. We argue that human engineering is potentially less risky than geoengineering and that it could help behavioural and market solutions succeed in mitigating climate change. We also consider some possible ethical concerns regarding human engineering such as its safety, the implications of human engineering for our children and for the society, and we argue that these concerns can be addressed. Our upshot is that human engineering deserves further consideration in the debate about climate change. ...|$|E

The paper {{analyses}} {{the economic}} effects of Malta’s accession to the EC {{and the implications}} on the Maltese economy of an eventual participation in the Common Agricultural Policy. The methodology used is a partial-equilibrium model composed of three sub-models: a demand, a supply and a trade model. Empirical evidence shows that accession is going <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>adversely</b> both consumers and producers while the agriculture trade deficit will widen further. Both consumption patterns and production structures will undergo significant structural changes in order {{to adapt to the}} new situation. Certain fiscal and/or monetary measures will have to be gradually introduced to control a potential upsurge in the consumer price level and the trade deficit. Current agricultural policies will have to be radically restructured if the sector is to meet the challenges as well as any opportunities that entry into the EC will give rise to. Titre.
