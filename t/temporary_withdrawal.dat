5|$|The loss of Blücher and {{the damage}} done to Lützow caused the German force to withdraw. The ground troops were landed on {{the eastern side of the}} fjord; they {{proceeded}} inland and captured the Oscarborg Fortress by 09:00 on 10 April. They then moved on to attack the capital. Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the <b>temporary</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of Blüchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the <b>temporary</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

Although operating off an airstrip menaced by intruding tanks and under occasional 130mm shell fire, the RLAF continued to strike the enemy. Many of the T-28 bombing sorties flown were only minutes in duration, because the enemy was so close. Combat sorties for the year amounted to about 30,000.|$|E
40|$|Replacement demand due {{to regular}} and early retirement, disablement, <b>temporary</b> <b>withdrawals</b> of women owing to birth and child raising, et cetera, {{constitutes}} {{an important element}} of the future demand for newcomers on the labour market. It is, however, often neglected in manpower forecasting studies. In this paper, we develop a flow model with which we can forecast the replacement demand at a detailed level of types of education. The essential element of the model is the determination of the yearly outflow coefficients for each type of education, distinguished by age category and gender. Instead of applying a fixed coefficient approach (Willems and De Grip (1993), we will introduce the random coefficient estimation technique in the model. This technique takes the reliability of the flow coefficients explicitly into account. If a specific flow coefficient is unreliable, the random coefficient estimate will tend towards the mean value for that age category over the types of education. This means that ad hoc corrections based on judgmental forecasting can be considerably reduced. Moreover, it will be shown that the random coefficient estimates of labour market outflow are more reliable than the estimates of the Willems/De Grip model. ...|$|R

30|$|An {{additional}} {{issue in}} assessing the difference in completion rates between the university and VET sector {{is that there has}} been some controversy about the way in which completion rates are determined in the vocational system. At the current point in time there is no unique student identifier and the concept of commencement of a qualification is not very well defined in the VET system (Mark and Karmel 2010). Completion rates can consequently not be calculated in a straightforward manner. In their paper, Mark and Karmel therefore used a modeling technique in an attempt to derive completion rates in Australian vocational education. This approach enabled them to estimate completion rates for students commencing in 2005 and yielded an overall completion rate of 27.1  %, with significant variation between several categories of students (for example, full-time, part-time, age groups, course level). The result of this analysis has been met with some skepticism. Ross (2011) cited various industry figures who pointed to substantially higher completion rates in selected fields. For instance, an independent analysis by Service Skills Australia (SSA) yielded completion rates substantially higher than the figures published by Mark and Karmel. Reasons cited as responsible for the discrepancies were <b>temporary</b> <b>withdrawals</b> such as for pregnancy, illness, relocation, etc. which were not accounted for in the Mark and Karmel study. The authors of the original study dismissed these objections and suggested that the SSA study relied on cherry-picked training providers and on too short a period of analysis (Ross 2011). Despite these somewhat conflicting research results with respect to actual completion figures, there is a general perception that Australian VET completion rates are low (Mark and Karmel 2010; Azemikhah 2009; Snell and Hart 2007).|$|R

The project was co-produced by her husband at the time, Phil Spector, whose <b>temporary</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from music-making in 1966 had forced Ronnie to reluctantly abandon her own career. After the single became only a minor hit, and following recording sessions that had been hampered by the producer's erratic behaviour, the proposed album was cancelled.

40|$|Most {{people are}} {{susceptible}} to oversharing their personal information publicly on social platforms today. As a coping strategy, these platforms offer mechanisms allowing users to delete their posts, and a significant fraction of users exercise this right to be forgotten. However, ironically, users' attempt to reduce attention to sensitive posts via deletion, in practice, attracts unwanted attention from stalkers, curious friends, and even blackmailers specifically to those (deleted) posts. In fact, multiple third party services today identify and hoard deleted posts from millions of users. Thus, in general, deletions may leave users more vulnerable to attacks on their privacy, and users hoping to make their posts forgotten can face a "damned if I do, damned if I don't" dilemma. In the form of intermittent withdrawals, we propose a rather disruptive solution (Letheia) to this problem of (really) forgetting the forgotten. If the platforms {{are willing to give}} up the uninterrupted availability of non-deleted posts by a very small fraction, Letheia provides privacy to the deleted posts over long durations. With Letheia, an adversarial observer becomes unsure if some posts are permanently deleted or just temporarily withdrawn; at the same time, the adversarial observer is overwhelmed by a large number of falsely flagged undeleted posts. We analyze large-scale data about users' deletion over Twitter and thoroughly investigate how to choose time duration distributions for alternating between <b>temporary</b> <b>withdrawals</b> and resurrections of non-deleted posts. We find a favorable trade-off between privacy, availability and adversarial overhead in Letheia under different settings. For example, we show that while maintaining content availability as high as 95 %, Letheia offers deletion privacy for up to 3 months from the time of deletion while still keeping the adversarial precision to 20 %.

40|$|Abstract — Basal {{cortisol}} {{levels were}} compared in prisoners convicted of violent crimes, in men previously convicted of violent crimes but currently not in prison, in non-violent alcoholics, and in randomly selected control males. Most {{of the violent}} men were diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (DSM-UI-R 301. 70). Morning, afternoon, and evening levels of plasma cortisol were assessed after a minimum alcohol abstinence of 24 h. The imprisoned violent men had significantly lower cortisol levels than the unimprisoned, which may reflect their prolonged alcohol abstinence and/or habituation to chronic stress. The unimprisoned violent men were heavy drinkers and their elevated sober-state cortisol may reflect <b>temporary</b> alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> or acute stress. We suggest that variations in basal cortisol are influenced more by environmental factors than by violent predisposition or antisocial personality disorder...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{inherent}} {{structure of the}} banking system, banks transform maturity from liquid deposits to illiquid assets, which creates vulnerability to bank runs. Even in situations where banks might be solvent, {{in the short run}} bank runs create an illiquidity problem, where banks would need to borrow funds to meet the <b>temporary</b> deposit <b>withdrawals.</b> However, under this situation, it might be harder to obtain foreign funds, as foreign creditors may also panic depending on the degree of commitment to repay international debts. Moreover, the higher the level of short term debt the higher the exposure to illiquidity problems. This models is particularly related to the situation in emerging markets, because of the larger role of banks compared to other financial institutions in these economies and because it is more difficult for them to get emergency funds from world markets during crisis periods.|$|R

30|$|Monitoring alone yields either zero results (in Hungary and Sweden (4)), or short-run {{positive}} results (in Germany (8), UK (4)) and long-run negative results {{due to increased}} long-run exits from the labor force. The studies for Hungary and Sweden evaluate the effect of an increased (announced) monitoring intensity and do not find any affect on employment rates. While the program set-up differs in many details, both interventions are reported to exhibit rather low actual risks of sanctioning for non-compliance in job search or for turning down job offers, which may hence {{have resulted in a}} low level of compliance. The study in the UK, in contrast, considers a policy reform increasing the actual risk of sanctioning, finding that after an initially positive employment effect, the medium-run effects on employment are negative, as youth tend to resort to alternative sources of social benefits, exempting them from any job search activities. Furthermore, negative effects on wage levels are found, the absolute size of which are larger for youth than for adults. The study for Germany (8) assesses the effects of <b>temporary</b> benefit <b>withdrawal</b> and finds substantial positive short-run employment effects that are increasing with the intensity of the sanction. While the effect on employment quality is not available, the authors suggest that the complete withdrawal of benefits may have had substantial negative effects on employment quality or labor force participation.|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the safety of afatinib in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Methods Patients with lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIb or IV) with EGFR mutations were first-line treated with an oral administration of afatinib (40 mg/d) until disease progression. Adverse events, effects, and survival condition were observed. Results The most common adverse events were diarrhea (n= 5, 100 %), skin rash (n= 4, 80 %), and mucositis/stomatitis (n= 4, 80 %). Moderate toxicities not exceeding grade 3 were observed. Relatively, the most serious adverse reaction was mucositis/stomatitis. Mild diarrhea occurred in all patients. Three patients experienced <b>temporary</b> drug <b>withdrawal</b> and dose reduction because of adverse reaction. Among the four patients who were evaluated, partial response was observed in two patients (50 %), one with stable disease (25 %) and one with progressive disease (25 %). Median progression-free survival was 9. 7 months, whereas median overall survival was 18. 4 months. Conclusion Afatinib was approved as first-line treatment for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The most common adverse events were diarrhea and skin rash.

The underlying strategic problem of self-enforceability is largely neglected with respect to an EU exit rule.
