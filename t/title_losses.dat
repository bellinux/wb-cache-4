25|$|In 1983, the Fabulous Moolah, {{who was the}} NWA World Women's Champion {{and legal}} owner of the title, joined the WWF and sold them {{the rights to the}} title after they disaffiliated from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and {{recognized}} her as the first WWF Women's Champion. Additionally, the WWF also recognized Moolah as having been champion ever since first winning the title from Judy Grable in 1956 and disregarded other reigns or <b>title</b> <b>losses</b> that occurred during the title's existence in the NWA. Thus, The Fabulous Moolah's reign was considered to have lasted 27 years by the promotion. WWF also introduced the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship with Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria recognized as the first champions after also defecting from the NWA.|$|E
50|$|Eberle {{was also}} on the gold-medal-winning team at the 1979 World Championships. Despite a fall on the balance beam in the team {{optional}} segment of the competition, her other scores were strong {{enough to keep the}} Romanian team in contention for the gold with the Soviet team. Ultimately, her compatriot Comăneci came back from an injury, taking only the compulsory segment of the team competition, and competed on the beam, where she earned a high score of 9.95, allowing the Romanians to drop Eberle's lower score and win the gold medal. It was a rare victory for the Romanians over the Soviet team, and one of the Soviets' only three World Championship or Olympic <b>title</b> <b>losses</b> between 1952, when a full women's gymnastics program was first held at the Olympic Games, and 1992, which was the last appearance of the unified Soviet team (under the guise of the Commonwealth of Independent States).|$|E
