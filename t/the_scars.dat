5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis refers to <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> (sclerae – {{better known as}} plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by battening onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, {{even more than}} the Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. <b>The</b> <b>scars</b> of the Viking raids had healed, but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa {{now turned}} to a more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki {{at the very end}} of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E
5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide <b>the</b> <b>scars</b> and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E

40|$|This work {{represents}} a quantitative analysis and visualisation of <b>scar</b> tissue of <b>the</b> left ventricular myocard. <b>The</b> <b>scar</b> information {{is shown in}} the late enhancement data, that highlights the avitale tissue {{with the help of a}} contrast agent. Through automatic methods, <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> is extracted from the image data and quantifies the size, location and transmurality. The transmurality shows a local measurement between the heart wall und the width of <b>the</b> <b>scar.</b> <b>The</b> developed methods help the cardiologist to analyse the measurement, the reason and the degree of the heart failure in a short time period. He can further control the results by several visual presentations. The deformation of <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> tissue over <b>the</b> heart cycle is implemented in another scientific work. A visual improvement of the deformation result which extracts <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> out of <b>the</b> data is aspired. The avital tissue is shown in a more comfortable way by eliminating the unnecessary image information and therefore improves the visual analysis of the pumping heart. Both methods show a detailed analysis of <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> tissue. This supports the clinic practical throughout the manual analysis...|$|R
50|$|After {{an injury}} in the central nervous system, {{scarring}} occurs to preserve the integrity of surrounding cells. Usually, astrocytes are associated with <b>the</b> <b>scarring</b> and are called glial scars. However, there is a stromal or nonglial component of <b>the</b> <b>scarring,</b> and lineage-tracking studies of pericytes following stroke revealed that they form {{the main component of}} <b>the</b> glial <b>scar.</b> Following traumatic brain injury, pericytes migrate out from the vasculature to the site of injury, differentiate into myofibroblasts and deposit extracellular matrix that forms the fibrotic component of <b>the</b> <b>scar.</b>|$|R
