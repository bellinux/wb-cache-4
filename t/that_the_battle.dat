5|$|Burnley: In 1856, Burnley Grammar School {{master and}} antiquary Thomas T. Wilkinson {{published}} a paper suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> {{occurred on the}} moors above Burnley, noting that the town stands on the River Brun. His work was subsequently referenced and expanded {{by a number of}} local authors.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Croatia sued Yugoslavia {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ), {{claiming}} genocide {{had been committed}} in Vukovar. Following Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution in 2006, this suit was passed on to Serbia. In February 2015, the ICJ ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> and ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide, but affirmed that serious crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed {{a victory}} at Khe Sanh, while US forces {{claimed that they}} had {{withdrawn}} as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of Viet Cong forces in the south before the early 1968 Tet Offensive. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General William Westmoreland, maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.|$|E

50|$|This battle set {{foundation}} for centuries-long Ottoman presence {{in this part}} of the Balkans. Serbian historian Stojan Novaković emphasized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle's</b> importance for these Serbian and Albanian lords was comparable to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Marica and Battle of Kosovo together. The important result of this battle was influx of Albanians into Ottoman forces who had been a significant source of its strength during next 527 years.|$|R
50|$|Various {{writers have}} {{asserted}} that this chapter supports a historical basis for King Arthur and {{have tried to}} identify <b>the</b> twelve <b>battles</b> with historical feuds or locales (see Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend). On the other hand, Thomas Green argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only identifiable <b>battles</b> linked explicitly with Arthur in Old Welsh sources are mythological, undermining any claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battles</b> had a basis in history.|$|R
5|$|Seeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was lost, Camus {{fled to the}} hills, {{pursued by}} Robert de Keith (purported {{ancestor}} of the Marischals of Scotland), who caught up with and slew him at Brae Downie where, it is said, the Camus Cross (NO 519379) was erected in memory of him.|$|E
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted {{the morale of the}} Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kellogg's Grove, {{like many}} of the battles and skirmishes during the Black Hawk War, had no real order or strategy. Early sources {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was a complete victory for the state militia, declaring the battle a rout and noting that the Sauk lost 15 while the militia only suffered 5 men killed. Conversely, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the result, essentially, was that the band of approximately 50 Sauk warriors routed the 300 or so ill-disciplined white troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
5|$|There is {{consensus}} among military historians <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> at Sedan sealed {{the fate of}} Belgium and France. On 14 May, the Allied forces had been wrongfooted and through the failures in deployment had effectively lost the campaign. The advance to the Channel would trap 1,700,000 soldiers and expel the Allies from Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
50|$|Anglo-Saxon battle tactics {{have also}} spawned much debate. Some historians believe that horses were used, though most argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battles</b> {{took place on}} foot.

5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. They took the portcullis down, but could not find boats to cross the Doubs, so some soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not knowing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, they are relayed command orders and objectives dispatched by the Selene military satellite, Hyperion. The orders are synthesized by the on-board central computer EOS, which also records and relays the player's flight and battle record data back to Hyperion. After {{completion of the}} last objective, the player is informed by Hyperion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> pattern of the latest EOS unmanned fighter has been completed {{according to the data}} from their battle record. The player is given the honor of being the target of the last EOS test as reward for their heroic efforts and that upon the player's death, they shall advance two classes and be awarded the Sirius decoration. After surviving the intense barrage of artillery fire of the EOS test, the pilot wonders why they must be terminated by their ally and questions their military leaders' rationale for the war.|$|E
5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> would inevitably be rejoined {{and so the}} aftermath of the British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more manoeuvrable ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} similar casualties {{during the}} previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian soldiers, who were convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was over once Fort 54 fell. The battle was far from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, {{in order to support}} the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field.|$|E

5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was {{too complex}} for the HV {{and especially for}} the HVO. He {{also pointed out that}} the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence, noting that they had failed to detect the presence of the VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured Brigades early on. Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simić, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> occurred in 634.|$|E
