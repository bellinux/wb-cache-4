40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} first U–Pb zircon {{ages and}} geochemical data from Carboniferous granitoids (<b>tonalites</b> and plagiogranites) of the Char suture–shear zone in East Kazakhstan, {{which is located}} in the north-western Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The study included analysis of geological setting, major and trace elements, and rock petrogenesis. The Char <b>tonalites</b> and plagiogranites occur as NW-striking linear chains inside Visean serpentinite mélange. Petrographycally, the <b>tonalites</b> show signs of syntectonic deformation, and the plagiogranites are less deformed suggesting their later intrusion. The <b>tonalites</b> yielded a LA-ICP-MS zircon age of ca. 323 Ma, i. e. exactly at the boundary between the early and late Carboniferous. Compositionally, the <b>tonalites</b> and plagiogranites are characterized, respectively, by high SiO 2 (67 – 70 and 73 – 74  wt. %) and Al 2 O 3 (17 – 19 and 14 – 15  wt. %), Sr/Y >  40 and low Yb =  0. 2 – 0. 5  ppm. Their multi-element patterns show clear Nb-Ta negative anomalies. The low Nb/Ta ratios (7 – 15) and Zr (114 – 191  ppm) suggest a MORB-type protolith (amphibolite) with subchondritic Nb/Ta (8 – 17) and low Zr (1 – 72  ppm). The low contents of K and Rb suggest weak assimilation of the melts by island arc felsic crust. The subchondritic Nb/Ta ratios exclude their derivation by the melting of subducted/dehydrated MORB. We argue that the Char high-Al <b>tonalites</b> and plagiogranites formed by the melting of hydrated MORB {{at the base of the}} mafic lower crust at pressures of 10 – 15  kbar. The occurrences of the Char <b>tonalites</b> and plagiogranites inside the Visean serpentinite mélange overlapped by Serpukhovian conglomerates, their alignment parallel to deformation zones, and their geochemical features suggest their origin by the melting of mafic lower crust in relation to the collision of the Siberian and Kazakhstan continents...|$|R

The Amami <b>tonalites</b> were probably formed by fractional crystallization from the basaltic magma or partial melting of basaltic arc crust. Mizuno et al.

A generation of younger, ? 2100 Ma-old, non-foliated biotite-bearing granites intrudes the former rock units. We have investigated the younger granite pluton of Kouare that was previously considered as forming a single body with the pluton of Satenga to the west, a pluton which likely belongs to the ? 20 Ma more recent Tenkodogo-Yamba batholith. Magnetic fabric measurements have been combined with microstructural observations and the analysis of field and aeromagnetic data. The granite encloses angular enclaves of the host <b>tonalites.</b> Magmatic microstructures are preserved inside the pluton and solid-state, high-temperature deformation features are ubiquitous at its periphery.

Around Kouare, the foliation in the host <b>tonalites</b> conforms with a map-scale, Z-shaped fold in between NNE-trending shear zones, implying a bulk clockwise rotation of the material contained in-between the shear zones, including the emplacing pluton.

A structural analysis was carried out to outline the tectonic meaning of the shear zone. In addition, thermobarometry and geochronology allowed to define the structural level and age of deformation. The shear zone is localised along layers of calc-silicate bearing marbles near the contact between late Hercynian <b>tonalites</b> and migmatitic paragneisses. Marbles, interpreted as former skarns, still retain the original high temperature Hercynian mineral assemblage including diopside, grossular, anorthite-rich plagioclase ± scapolite ± hornblende. Deformation took place in greenschist facies at about 400 °C and 600 MPa. This event partially affected the peak assemblage in marbles, as documented by coronas of clinozoisite around anorthite-rich plagioclase. Rb-Sr method applied on two biotite separates coming from sheared gneisses gave Eocene ages of 51 and 56 Ma. The shear zone is broadly oriented WNW - ESE and shows nearly vertical foliation planes. Large scale folds undulate the foliation planes whose direction swings from NW - SE to NE-SW. Lineations generally show a shallow plunge with trends mostly spanning from E-W to NW-SE. In some cases lineations show a wide scatter in orientation and locally can be nearly vertical. Shear sense indicators and quartz c-axis distribution are coherent with sinistral kinematics along nearly horizontal lineations, and south side up displacement along steeply plunging lineations.
