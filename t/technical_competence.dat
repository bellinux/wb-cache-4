40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} {{processes}} in project management based on international standard IPMA Comptence Baseline (ICB). Its main {{goal is to}} create process models of chosen <b>technical</b> <b>competences</b> of the ICB. The models were built in a program called Bizagi Modeler in accordance with an international standard Business Process Model and Notation. Results of this thesis are represented by the process models for each of the chosen <b>technical</b> <b>competences</b> and by an overall model that put all the created competences together. It helps to show connections between the competences as well as to understand the application of competences within the project cycle. Crucial steps of chosen competences are also applied to a model project for better understanding of a real application. Created process models may serve as a user guide for project managers who manage projects according to the ICB...|$|R

Although the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions do not use the Hedgehog Engine, graphics for these platforms were still praised for their high quality, with the title being nominated for Best Graphics Technology for the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards. The soundtrack to the game was also praised as being an improvement on more recent installments in the series; use of an orchestral score, rather than rock as in more recent games, was appreciated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{quality of}} Higher {{education}} {{at various times}} in modern China has changed at various times, reflecting the changes in political policies implemented by the central government. Following {{the founding of the}} PRC, in 1949, the Chinese government's educational focus was largely on political [...] "re-education". In periods of political upheaval, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, ideology was stressed over professional or <b>technical</b> <b>competence.</b> During {{the early stages of the}} Cultural Revolution (1966-1969), tens of thousands of college students joined Red Guard organizations, which persecuted many university faculty members as [...] "counter-revolutionaries" [...] and effectively closed China's universities. When universities reopened in the early 1970s, enrollments were reduced from pre-Cultural Revolution levels, and admission was restricted to individuals who had been recommended by their work unit (danwei), possessed good political credentials, and had distinguished themselves in manual labor. In the absence of stringent and reasonably objective entrance examinations, political connections became increasingly important in securing the recommendations and political dossiers necessary to qualify for university admission. As a result, the decline in educational quality was profound. Deng Xiaoping reportedly wrote Mao Zedong in 1975 that university graduates were [...] "not even capable of reading a book" [...] in their own fields when they left the university. University faculty and administrators were demoralized by the political aspects of the university system.|$|E
