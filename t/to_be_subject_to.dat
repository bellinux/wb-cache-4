5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by the Mint to adjust the design, the coins proved to strike indistinctly, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> wear—the dates were easily worn away in circulation. In 1938, after the expiration of the minimum 25-year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization, it {{was replaced by the}} Jefferson nickel, designed by Felix Schlag. Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold American Buffalo series.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E
5|$|The Gjøvik Line {{was chosen}} as the first service <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> PSO. The {{deadline}} for applying for prequalification was on 1 April 2004, and seven companies applied. These were Norges Statsbaner, Ofotbanen, Arriva, Veolia, Danske Statsbaner (DSB) and Keolis. The companies were required to document their competency to be qualified for security and operation permits from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate; and were not allowed to subsidize the operations from activities that were not subject to competition. To participate in the bid, NSB established the subsidiary NSB Anbud AS in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{support of}} the Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (who was also Prime Minister of the United Kingdom then), for an Anglican King's College London and the Roman Catholic Relief Act, which was {{to lead to the}} granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea, in early 1829. Winchilsea and his supporters wished for King's <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the Test Acts, like the universities of Oxford, where only members of the Church of England could matriculate, and Cambridge, where non-Anglicans could matriculate but not graduate, but this was not Wellington's intent.|$|E
5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> their fathers, then {{to their}} husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E
5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination may be expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Fosen Trafikklag {{purchased}} Inderøy Municipality's {{shares in}} Innherredferja, while Verran Sparebank bought those previously owned by Mosvik Municipality. In its {{last year of}} operation, the Skarnsund service carried 267,894 people, 108,482 cars, 13,878 trucks, 840 buses and 312 motorcycles. Skarnsund II was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK23,357,778. In 1992, the annual meeting had to be postponed due to a ferry strike, which prevented the shareholders from Ytterøy attending. Levanger Municipality and Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality were the only remaining public shareholders, and in 1992 Levanger announced that they intended to sell the Trondheim-based ferry operator Fosen Trafikklag. However, the politicians changed their mind, and the municipality remained as a shareholder. In 1994, both ferries were out of service and a small passenger ferry was used for a few days. In 1996, the company was again hit by a strike. Normally the service was not chosen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> strikes due to the high regularity needed by the chicken manufacturer Trønderkylling, who would otherwise have to proceed with unnecessary slaughtering of animals. In 1997, a cooperation with Fosen Trafikklag started, including the two using a shared reserve ferry, Austråt.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> future refinement.|$|E
