In the first Test, England recalled Eric Hollies and selected three debutants: Sam Cook, Tom Dollery and Jack Martin. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with Charlie Barnett replacing Dollery, George Pope replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test {{and was replaced by}} Cliff Gladwin while [...] Ken Cranston was brought in to replace Pope.

Edrich missed the last Test, as again did Bedser, and there were yet more changes elsewhere with Dick Howorth coming in to replace Barnett and Bill Copson replacing Butler. Jack Robertson took Edrich's place. It all meant that, in a five-match series they won 3–0, England used 21 different players.|$|E

5000|$|Jack (Henry Thomas), who {{has been}} drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone. The clock on the {{dashboard}} reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a human body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers {{to call the police}} over Jack's protests, insisting that it is no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she [...] "never uses" [...] and because she is friends with the Chief of Police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack and, noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer <b>test.</b> <b>Jack</b> requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers, getting him to recite the alphabet in reverse from Z to A. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the two people already {{in the back of the}} cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit. While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over, Jack is able to pull clippers out of his pocket, cut the cable tie, and escape. Hannagan pursues, leaving the cruiser door open, and Duffy and Buzzy also escape. Jack runs across a property with security lights and a dog, causing the owner, Norma, to come out. She is obviously upset and is looking for her husband Frank (Patrick Swayze) because she just received a phone call that their daughter, Cheri (Rachael Leigh Cook), was killed in a hit-and-run accident. Hannagan catches up to Jack at this point, and Norma angrily strikes Jack with a flashlight, assuming that he is responsible for her daughter's death. He flees again, into the cemetery where he trips over a bowling ball and is again taken into custody.|$|E

40|$|Introduction.  Tarsal {{coalition}} is congenital bony, cartilaginous, or fibrous fusion between tarsal bones. The most specific clinical feature {{of these patients}} is limitation of tarsal joints mobility. Foot mobility is evaluated using a few clinical tests-tip-toe <b>test,</b> <b>Jack</b> test, and manual evaluation of passive foot inversion/eversion. However, these tests do not have high rates of sensitivity and specificity, and cannot {{be used to make}} differential diagnosis among the different types of coalitions. Aims.  To improve the clinical diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Materials and methods.  We present a new clinical test-evaluation of calcaneonavicular segment mobility. To evaluate this test, we studied a group of 100 children (155  feet), which included those with talocalcaneal coalitions (22  patients/ 30  feet), calcaneonavicular coalitions (28 patients/ 45 feet), and those without tarsal coalitions (50  patients/ 80 feet). Results.  The sensitivity of the test was 95. 6 %, and specificity was 93. 3 %. This test had good reproducibility, as evidenced by the inter-rater reliability coefficient of 0. 818. Conclusions.  The clinical test presented here can be used to identify patients with calcaneonavicular coalitions, which could not be identified using other clinical tests of foot mobilit...|$|E
