40|$|This paper mainly investigates {{consensus}} {{problem with}} pull-based event-triggered feedback control. For each agent, the diffusion coupling feedbacks {{are based on}} the states of its in-neighbors at its latest <b>triggering</b> <b>time</b> and the next <b>triggering</b> <b>time</b> of this agent is determined by its in-neighbors' information as well. The general directed topologies, including irreducible and reducible cases, are investigated. The scenario of distributed continuous monitoring is considered firstly, namely each agent can observe its in-neighbors' continuous states. It is proved that if the network topology has a spanning tree, then the event-triggered coupling strategy can realize consensus for the multi-agent system. Then the results are extended to discontinuous monitoring, i. e., self-triggered control, where each agent computes its next <b>triggering</b> <b>time</b> in advance without having to observe the system's states continuously. The effectiveness of the theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example finally. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1407. 137...|$|R
50|$|A light-collection system often {{accompanies the}} basic LArTPC {{as a means}} of extracting more {{information}} from an event by scintillation light. It can also {{play an important role in}} triggering, because it collects scintillation light only nanoseconds after the particle passes through the detector. This is comparatively (on the order of 1000 times) shorter than the time taken by the freed electrons to drift to the wire planes, so it is often sufficient to demarcate the collection time of scintillation photons as a <b>trigger</b> <b>time</b> (t0) for an event. With this <b>trigger</b> <b>time,</b> one can then find electron drift times, which enables three-dimensional reconstruction of an event. While such systems are not the only means by which a LArTPC can identify a <b>trigger</b> <b>time,</b> they are necessary for studying phenomena like supernovae and proton decay, where the particles undergoing decay or interaction are not produced in a human-made accelerator and the timing of a beam of particles is therefore not known. Photomultiplier tubes, light guides, and silicon photomultipliers are examples of instruments used to collect this light. These are typically positioned just outside the drift volume.|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{distributed}} embedded hard real-time systems {{there is}} an ongoing trend to move from traditional event <b>triggered</b> systems to <b>time</b> <b>triggered</b> systems, mainly driven by the unpredictability of communication media like CAN. However, many systems do not fit into this strict periodic framework due to sporadic triggering of tasks. Therefore, on task level {{it is common to}} mix event and <b>time</b> <b>triggered</b> systems, supported by a mixed real-time operating system. This mixed application cause problems in the verification of complex time properties, because traditional timing analysis over-approximates the time consumed by the <b>time</b> <b>triggered</b> parts.

50|$|Typical input signals for CFDs are pulses from plastic {{scintillation}} counters, such {{as those}} used for lifetime measurement in positron annihilation experiments. The scintillator pulses have identical rise times that are much longer than the desired temporal resolution. This forbids simple threshold triggering, which causes a dependence of the <b>trigger</b> <b>time</b> on the signal's peak height, an effect called time walk (see diagram). Identical rise times and peak shapes permit triggering not on a fixed threshold but on a constant {{fraction of the total}} peak height, yielding trigger times independent from peak heights.|$|E

30|$|In Theorem  1, two event-triggered {{conditions}} (7) and (8) are proposed. At the <b>triggering</b> <b>time</b> t_k_i^i, {{the left-hand}} term κ_i(t_k_i^i)= 0. In (7), if there exists {{at least one}} node which does not synchronize with s(t), the right-hand term must be positive. Therefore, the next <b>triggering</b> <b>time</b> t_k_i+ 1 ^i must be greater than t_k_i^i. In (8), the right-hand term must be always positive for all nodes. Thus, the interevent intervals of all nodes are strictly positive. Although the two updating rules (7) and (8) {{are closely related to}} each other in some respects, the event-triggered condition in (8) is verified more easily than the condition in (7). Moreover, according to (16) and (19), the convergence under the event-triggered scheme (7) is better than under (8). The number of updating times under the event-triggered scheme (7) is more than (8).|$|R

While Nico and Dallas are out, Van Helsing and his four employees storm the house and drive stakes through Richard and Panthia. They tie Ulrike to a bedpost, but she taunts the Crips into having sex with her before Van Helsing finally stakes her, too. Little do they know that to have sex with a vampire turns a person into a vampire. Suddenly, Nico walks in, horrified at the carnage. She attacks Trigger, who pulls a gun and tries to get off a shot. The bullet hits Rachel instead. Nico grabs the gun and shoots <b>Trigger.</b> <b>Time</b> Bomb subdues Nico with a rope of garlic, just as Dallas returns home and comes face to face with Van Helsing. In exchange for letting Nico go, Dallas offers to lead Van Helsing to The Count. So, Van Helsing, Time Bomb, Trigger, L'il Monster, Soda Pop, Nico, Rachel and Dallas pile into Van Helsing's van and head for The Count's house. Unfortunately, The Count's henchmen intercept them and take Nico and Van Helsing to The Count, where he hooks up Nico to a blood-draining machine and places Van Helsing in a box with only his head sticking out. Just as The Count is about to crack open Van Helsing's skull with a hammer, Dallas drives the van through the wall of the club. Dallas and the Crips, now vampires, come out shooting. Many bullets and stakes later, The Count and his henchmen are destroyed, Nico is set free, Rachel has been made into a vampire, and Nico, Rachel, and Dallas have decided to move to New York. In the closing scene, a pajama-clad Van Helsing runs down an alley, screaming for forgiveness from his son. As he utters apologies to God and his son Hans, he screams for help, revealing his new vampire fangs in front of two policemen.|$|E

40|$|Self-triggered {{implementations}} of controllers {{have been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} traditional time-triggered implementations. In a self-triggered implementation, the control task computes the actuator signal as well as a triggering time that specifies the next time instant at which the control task should be run. Self-triggered implementations have the potential to decrease communication costs and CPU requirements over time-triggered ones, e. g., by running the steady-state plant in open loop for long intervals if there is no disturbance. We show that commonly claimed gains for self-triggered implementations are too optimistic. The analysis of most self-triggering algorithms ignore the execution times for computing the trigger times. We show, using implementations of several self-triggering algorithms proposed in the literature on common embedded platforms, that the execution time to compute the <b>trigger</b> <b>time</b> can be non-negligible compared to the trigger times, and may even be higher than the <b>trigger</b> <b>time</b> itself, rendering a naive implementation infeasible.

We perform trigger-time computation tasks with low priority, and fall back on a timetriggered implementation when the <b>trigger</b> <b>time</b> computations are not guaranteed to finish in time (but use the computed results to update the cache).

40|$|The Fast Handover {{protocol}} [1] provides seamless handover in wireless IP networks by minimizing handover latency. To reduce handover latency and {{to provide}} faster handover, Fast Handover uses anticipation based on layer 2 (L 2) trigger information. Therefore, it incurs higher signaling costs compared with the basic Mobile IP protocol. Furthermore, since the L 2 trigger is based on fluctuating wireless channel states, the handover anticipation using the L 2 trigger may sometimes be incorrect. In the case of incorrect anticipation, unnecessary buffer space {{may be used for}} the purpose of providing a smooth handover. Therefore, it is essential to analyze these overhead costs, in order to evaluate and compare the performance of Fast Handover with that of the basic Mobile IP protocol. In this paper, we analyzed the overhead associated with Fast Handover including the signaling cost and the packet delivery cost. We formulated these costs based on a timing diagram and compared Fast Handover with basic Mobile IPv 6 in terms of their packet loss rates and buffer requirements. Also, we studied the impact of the L 2 <b>triggering</b> <b>time</b> on the total overhead cost.
