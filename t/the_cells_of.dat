5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some {{is bound to}} metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but {{in a form that}} lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} gene transfer as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E

Two situations are considered: (1) different RNS-FH patterns are allocated to <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> interest and <b>the</b> interfering <b>cell</b> (denoted by <b>the</b> solid line); (2) the same RNS-FH pattern as <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> interest is assigned to <b>the</b> interfering <b>cell</b> (denoted by <b>the</b> dashed line). Here, we model the intercell interference as additive Gaussian-distributed distortion. Therefore, in scenario (1), users in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> interest will experience different interferences from <b>the</b> interfering <b>cell</b> across all hops, which in turn induces interference diversity. Figure 8 clearly demonstrates that by employing the proposed method (i.e., allocating a different RNS-FH pattern to <b>the</b> interfering <b>cell),</b> <b>the</b> intercell interference floor can be significantly lowered relative to the scenario where all cells employ identical RNS-FH patterns.|$|R

5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration.

Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E

40|$|Identifying <b>the</b> normal <b>cell</b> {{from which}} a tumor {{originates}} is crucial to understand-ing the etiology of that cancer. However, retrospective identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> origin in cancer is challenging because of the accumulation of genetic and epige-netic changes in tumor <b>cells.</b> <b>The</b> biologic state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> origin likely influences the genetic events that drive transforma-tion. We directly tested this hypothesis by performing a Sleeping Beauty trans-poson mutagenesis screen in which com-mon insertion sites were identified in tumors that were produced by mutagen-esis <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> at varying time points throughout the T lineage. Mutation and gene expression data derived from these tumors were then compared with data obtained from a panel of 84 human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples, including copy number alterations and gene expression profiles. This revealed that altering <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> origin produces tumors that model distinct subtypes of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leuke-mia, suggesting that even subtle changes in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> origin dramatically affect genetic selection in tumors.

5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles.
