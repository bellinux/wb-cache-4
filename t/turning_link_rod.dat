40|$|The {{hold down}} bolt {{of the fans}} of an air cooler has failed by fatigue. Investigation showed that jamming of the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> at the eye-end due to {{corrosion}} restricted {{the rotation of the}} <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> when the positioner acted to adjust the pitch of the blade. This has resulted in excessive stresses on the hold down bolt leading to failure by fatigue. The damages seen on other parts of the air cooler are secondary and subsequent to the failure of the hold down bolt. Use of stainless steel grade material for the construction of the linkages and periodic lubrication at the eye-end of the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> are recommended to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R
40|$|A broken tail gearbox (TGB) {{housing and}} failed pitch link {{assemblies}} {{of a helicopter}} {{were sent to the}} laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that three out of the four attachment lugs of the TGB housing had fractured by overload. The fourth one had a 2. 4 mm long fatigue crack at the fillet of the lug fusing area with the temperature sensor – locating boss. Analysis shows that the failure of this lug was also due to overload and the presence of the fatigue crack was coincidental. All the pitch <b>link</b> <b>rods</b> had fractured due to sudden overload, probably during the dislodgement of the tail rotor blades. This had also resulted in snapping of all the cables with the pitch <b>link</b> <b>rods.</b> It appears that all the failures were instantaneous and would have taken place due to sudden overload on the TGB housing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{time-dependent}} reliability {{model of}} Mechanical Component {{is influenced by}} many parameters such as stress, load, strength, strength degeneration and lifetime index. This paper builds the time-dependent reliability model when life {{is measured by the}} loading numbers. The variety law of mechanical component’s reliability with the lifetime is derived from the built model and simulation of <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> in needle bar mechanism used in the sewing machine. The result shows that the time-dependent reliability model is effective and the reliability of component decreases obviously with the loading numbers when the strength degeneration is considered...|$|R

The nonlinear analytical results showed that the proposed five-member model enables one to reasonably and effectively simulate the lateral behavior and collapse mechanism of the steel-scaffolding structures.
