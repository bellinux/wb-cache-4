5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. <b>The</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E

By the time of Polybius, the triarii or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the hastati and principes had become indistinguishable.|$|E
5|$|The {{idealization}} of Tamar {{was further}} accentuated {{by the events}} that took place under her immediate successors; within two decades of Tamar's death, the Khwarezmian and Mongol invasions brought Georgian ascendancy to an abrupt end. Later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match the achievements of Tamar's reign. All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]].

5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear.

However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Since 1979, Pachylemur has {{generally}} been regarded as a distinct genus, but some classifications include the genus in Lemur or the ruffed lemur genus Varecia. In a 1982 review, Ian Tattersall recognized two species, Lemur insignis and Lemur jullyi. He did not regard Pachylemur as a distinct genus or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, Lemur jullyi Standing, 1904, is preoccupied by Palaeochirogalus jullyi Grandidier, 1899, and thus invalid. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they {{belong to the same}} species, which he could continue to call Lemur jullyi. Recent classifications recognize Pachylemur as a valid genus with two species—P.insignis (Filhol, 1895) and P.jullyi (Grandidier, 1899)—but express doubt about <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two species.|$|E
5|$|Sinoceratops was {{assigned}} to the taxon Centrosaurinae, as a basal member by Xu et al. (2010) based on characteristics present in the skull. Sinoceratops bears several characteristics that resemble features in chasmosaurines, blurring <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae. According to Xu e.a. the basal position of Sinoceratops indicates that ceratopids originated in Asia. Sinoceratops however, shares a number of features with advanced centrosaurines such as Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus that are not seen in primitive centrosaurines like Diabloceratops, including a well-developed nose horn and reduced brow horns. The implication might be that this genus represents a lineage that invaded Asia from North America through Beringia.|$|E

5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland {{in the early}} modern era covers {{all aspects of the}} land in Scotland, including physical and human, between the sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Agricultural Revolution and industrialisation in the eighteenth century. The defining factor in the {{geography of}} Scotland is <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the Lowlands into the fertile Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the Little Ice Age, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Unas {{had several}} daughters and {{possibly}} {{one or two}} sons who {{are believed to have}} predeceased him. Manetho, an Egyptian priest of the Ptolemaic period and author of the first history of Egypt, claims that with Unas' death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. Unas was succeeded by Teti, the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, possibly after a short crisis. However, the archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians at the time made no conscious break with the preceding dynasty and <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the basis}} for Manetho's choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas, Egyptians living at the time {{probably}} perceived no particular change from one dynasty to the next. The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances, with many officials continuing their careers from Unas' onto Teti's reign. These include the viziers Mehu, Kagemni and Nikau-Isesi and the overseer of the province of Edfu Isi. Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom might not have conceived of dynasties, <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory.|$|E

5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express {{the personality of the}} type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|In biochemistry, {{heavy metals}} are {{sometimes}} defined—on {{the basis of}} the Lewis acid (electronic pair acceptor) behaviour of their ions in aqueous solution—as class B and borderline metals. In this scheme, class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors; class B ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors; and borderline or ambivalent ions show either class A or B characteristics, depending on the circumstances. Class A metals, which tend to have low electronegativity and form bonds with large ionic character, are the alkali and alkaline earths, aluminium, the group 3 metals, and the lanthanides and actinides. Class B metals, which tend to have higher electronegativity and form bonds with considerable covalent character, are mainly the heavier transition and post-transition metals. Borderline metals largely comprise the lighter transition and post-transition metals (plus arsenic and antimony). <b>The</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> class A metals and the other two categories is sharp. A frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted.|$|E
5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. <b>The</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> king's {{personal}} household {{department of}} the Wardrobe and the governmental {{department of the}} Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under scandium and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Highlands and Islands {{in the north and}} west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism.|$|E
