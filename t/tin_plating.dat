25|$|The {{formation}} of the U.S. Steel trust in 1901 threatened the AA with ruin. The trust incorporated plants of the American <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Co. into U.S Steel. If the AA was to save its existing locals at American <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> and American Sheet Steel, it had to organize all the plants of U.S. Steel. But before an organizing drive could get under way, U.S. Steel's <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> subsidiary withdrew recognition from the AA and refused to bargain at unionized plants. The independent American Sheet Steel did the same.|$|R

5000|$|In 1905, Weir and Phillips {{took out}} loans of $10,000 and $15,000 (respectively) and {{organized}} the Phillips Sheet and <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company. They purchased the failing Jackson Sheet and <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company in Clarksburg, West Virginia, for $190,000. Phillips {{died in a}} train crash {{a few months after}} the company was formed, and Weir took as a new partner John C. Williams, a Welsh immigrant who was in charge of all <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> operations at the plant. They rapidly expanded the eight-mill facility, adding four more mills in 1908. A second plant with 10 mills was opened in Holliday's Cove, West Virginia, in 1909, and expanded by another 10 mills in 1910. That same year, Weir began building a company town next to Holliday's Cove, naming it Weirton. In 1912, Weir purchased the Pope Sheet and <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company in Steubenville, Ohio. By 1913, his company was the second largest manufacturer of <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> in the United States (behind US Steel). [...] Weir focused on vertical integration, purchasing coal mines, coking plants, furnaces, iron mines, ships, and tin mines. On August 1, 1918, (Weir's 43rd birthday), he renamed his firm the Weirton Steel Company.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, {{there was a}} {{developing}} trade in metal goods made of thin iron sheet, spurred by development of the rolling mill. Rustproofing this iron was important. <b>Tin</b> <b>plating</b> had been developed in Germany, and British manufacturers needed to compete.|$|E

5000|$|One unusual {{feature of}} the ground was the scarlet saucepans placed atop each goalpost.

40|$|In 1947, {{out of the}} 100, 000 long tons of tin con­sumed in the United States, 25, 000 tons {{went into}} solder. <b>Tin</b> <b>plate</b> took 39, 000 tons while babbit, bronze and coll­apsible tubes {{accounted}} for approximately 17, 000 tons.

50|$|Biscuit tins are steel cans made of <b>tin</b> <b>plate.</b> This {{consists}} of steel sheets thinly coated with tin. The sheets are then bent to shape. By about 1850 Britain {{had become the}} dominant world supplier of <b>tin</b> <b>plate,</b> {{through a combination of}} technical innovation and political control over most of the suppliers of tin ore. Biscuit tin manufacture was a small but prestigious part of the vast industry of <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> production, which saw a huge increase in demand in the 19th century was directly related to the growing industrialisation of food production, by increasingly sophisticated methods of preservation and the requirements made by changing methods of distribution.|$|R
50|$|A {{mixture of}} CrO3, HBF4, and {{sulfonic}} acids {{in conjunction with}} a cathode treatment give tin-plated steel. Tin(I) fluoroborate/fluoroboric acid mixtures and organic reagents are used as the electrolyte in the cathode treatment of the <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> process. Similar processes of electrodeposition and electrolytic stripping are used to obtain specific metal alloys.|$|E
50|$|The TSHD Sospan Dau is a Dutch {{trailing}} {{suction hopper}} dredger owned by Sosban BV. The vessel {{has worked on}} dredging projects, including offshore aggregates, port maintenance, land reclamation, coastal defense and beach replenishment. The name Sospan Dau is Welsh and originates from Sosban Fach and Llanelli's <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> industry, Sospan being the Welsh for Saucepan and Dau being Welsh for Two as the ship is a successor to the original Sospan.|$|E
50|$|Tinplate made via {{hot-dipped}} <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> {{is made by}} {{cold rolling}} steel or iron, pickling to remove any scale, annealing to remove any strain hardening, and then coating it with {{a thin layer of}} tin. Originally this was done by producing individual or small packs of plates, which became known as the pack mill process. In the late 1920s strip mills began to replace pack mills, because they could produce the raw plates in larger quantities and more economically.|$|E

The facility produced electrolytic and hot-dipped tinplate, black plate, and terneplate. It also had a metal decorating plant for coating and lithographing tin, terne, and black plate, and two electrolytic <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> lines that produced <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> at up to 1,000 feet per minute.|$|R

50|$|The Galaxy IV was a {{telecommunications}} satellite that was disabled and lost due to short circuits caused by tin whiskers in 1998. It was initially thought that space weather {{contributed to the}} failure, but later {{it was discovered that}} a conformal coating had been mis-applied, allowing whiskers formed in the pure <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> to find their way through a missing coating area, causing a failure of the main control computer. The manufacturer, Hughes, has moved to nickel plating, rather than tin, {{to reduce the risk of}} whisker growth. The tradeoff has been an increase in weight, adding 100 to 200 pounds per payload.|$|E

In the forward part of the vessel is the warhead, followed by the fuel, trimming and 2 steering air tanks. The forward part of the midsection is occupied by the 2600 L hydrogen peroxide chamber. This cylindrical tank required a complicated {{construction of}} welding 5 ribs evenly spaced around the circumference, then coating the inside of the tank with tin, then asphalt and finally with a thick <b>tin</b> <b>plating.</b> Construction of each tank took on average 2 weeks and the skill required was very high.|$|E

50|$|While it was {{the growth}} of the iron {{foundries}} and <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> that gave birth to japanning on metal, tin plated iron was not the only metal used. There are examples of brass, copper and bronze used as substrates. In France copper was the metal primarily used. Because it had to be hammered into shape rather than rolled and stamped the surface was uneven. This did not provide the best surface for japanning thus it has a greater tendency to flake off than the smoother English tinware. When the French made tinware it was often trimmed with bronze.|$|E
50|$|Edwin Tregelles's {{father had}} formed an Iron Founding {{partnership}} with his Quaker relatives in Falmouth, the Foxes and in South Wales, the Prices. Edwin was apprenticed to Joseph Tregelles Price (1784-1854) {{the manager of}} the Welsh wing of the firm, at the Neath Abbey Iron Works. He learnt a great deal of practical business and engineering.Around 1831, he set up on his own as a consulting engineer. He took part in many major projects, including the installation of town gas to many towns in Southern England, railway engineering and water and sewage projects. He was also involved with <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> in County Durham and the family's coal mines.|$|E
50|$|The song {{catalogues}} {{the troubles}} of a harassed housewife. The song {{is associated with the}} rugby union club Llanelli RFC and, more recently, the Scarlets regional rugby side. The association derives from Llanelli's <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> industry, which used to tin-plate steel saucepans and other kitchen utensils as a cheap supply to the British public. During the final years of Stradey Park, the former ground of Llanelli RFC and the Scarlets, the goalposts were adorned with Scarlet saucepans as a tribute to the town's history; the utensils have been transferred to the clubs' new ground, Parc y Scarlets. The Scarlets' official magazine is titled Sosban.|$|E

It accepted only members who had completed an apprenticeship in the trade, and charged older members higher joining fees.|$|R
