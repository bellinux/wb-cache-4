Middleton would be taking command of VIII Corps in England, and was sent to the various locations to confuse the enemy about the personnel change. Accompanying him was a sergeant who had been a physical <b>therapist</b> <b>in</b> civilian life, and who would massage Middleton's knees twice a day for the next year. When asked what staff he needed to take with him, Middleton replied that he would keep the staff that was already in place, except that for an aide he would like his old LSU friend, Mack Hornbeak, who had served with him through Sicily and Italy.|$|E

25|$|The ethical {{principle}} of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a <b>therapist</b> <b>in</b> {{the course of}} treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the therapeutic alliance, as it promotes an environment of trust.

This includes instances of suicidal behavior or homicidal plans, child abuse, elder abuse and dependent adult abuse.|$|E

25|$|Postmodern psychotherapies such as {{narrative}} {{therapy and}} coherence therapy did not impose definitions {{of mental health}} and illness, but rather saw the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and <b>therapist</b> <b>in</b> a social context. Systemic therapy also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics—and transpersonal psychology, which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other orientations developed {{in the last three}} decades include feminist therapy, brief therapy, somatic psychology, expressive therapy, applied positive psychology and the human givens approach. A survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed the most utilized models of therapy and the ten most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} REBT, {{the client}} {{together with the}} <b>therapist,</b> <b>in</b> a structured active-directive manner, often work {{through a set of}} target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are assessed in regards to the client's values and goals. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors. Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.|$|E

500|$|Carla is {{the eldest}} of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is {{somewhat}} seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. [...] "As the <b>therapist</b> <b>in</b> the family Carla likes {{to be the one}} who understands everything" [...] and [...] "has a tendency to lace all her compliments with calls to self-improvement". [...] However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother. Her criticism goes farther when she writes an autobiographical paper calling her mother mildly anal-retentive. [...] In Carla’s first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, [...] "Trespass", as she is walking home from school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car. Alvarez uses Carla's character to display the language difficulties faced with only having [...] "classroom English", and how communication barriers affect immigrants.|$|E

[...] "Without You" [...] was followed by [...] "Luv Your Life", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release.

Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a <b>therapist,</b> <b>in</b> our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology.

40|$|Psychoeducation {{procedures}} {{dominate the}} treatment used by occupational <b>therapists</b> <b>in</b> psychiatric rehabilitation. The underlying assumption of skills training {{is that the}} skills taught generalize, that is, they persist beyond the treatment session and are used by the client in the community. This paper surveys occupational therapy literature to evaluate the generalization of skills taught to adult psychiatric clients by occupational therapists. Of the 77 studies reviewed, only 13 (17 %) mentioned anything related to generalization. Seven of these articles statistically evaluated the outcome of skills training, but only four specifically assessed generalization of therapy. It is concluded that occupational <b>therapists</b> <b>in</b> psychiatry predominantly do not assess generalization of therapy. Discussion focuses on how four classes of generalization strategies (modifying the community environment, modifying the therapy environment, altering the style of therapy, and promoting client involvement) can enhance the effectiveness of occupational <b>therapists</b> <b>in</b> psychiatry...|$|R
