40|$|Dolphins and {{whales are}} highly {{specialized}} marine mammals that spend their entire life at sea. One {{of the greatest}} physiological challenges to these marine endotherms is thermoregulation (Irving, 1969; Whittow, 1987). To counterbalance the high thermal conductivity of water, cetaceans have developed thick insulating blubber layers that encase the body. <b>Thermal</b> <b>windows</b> in poorly insulated peripheral areas permit the transfer of excess heat during periods of high activity or when the ambient water is warm (McGinnis et al., 1972). Integral to the function of these <b>thermal</b> <b>windows</b> is the vascular system, which {{plays an important role}} in the thermoregulatory responses of cetaceans (Fig. 1). For example, whales and dolphins maintain a counter-current arrangement of blood vessels in their flukes, dorsal fins and pectoral fins that provides fine control over the movement of warm blood between the body core and peripheral areas (Scholander and Schevill, 1955). Direct vascular links have also been reported for the dorsal fin and flukes of dolphins and for the temperature-sensitive reproductive organs (Rommel et al., 1994). In addition to its thermoregulatory function, the vascular system of marine mammals plays a major role during the dive response. Marine mammals initiate a suite of physiological changes upon submergence to conserve oxygen and to support prolonged periods of breath-holding (Scholander, 1940; Elsner, 1969; Zapol et al., 1979; Kooyman, 1989). Collectively termed the dive response, these changes include a rapid, dramatic redistribution in blood flow that emphasizes the brain, lungs and heart. Apnea, bradycardia and a reduction in blood flow to peripheral sites (e. g. flippers and fins) are hallmarks of this response. These respiratory and cardiovascular adjustments, while facilitating oxygen conservation during submergence, may compromise the thermoregulatory function of <b>thermal</b> <b>windows</b> located in peripheral sites. Thus, an apparent conflict exists between oxygen conservation and heat dissipation during diving that results from the multiple roles played by the cardiovascular system of marine mammals. To determine the effect of the dive response o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe thermoregulatory {{theory of}} yawning posits that yawns {{function}} {{to cool the}} brain {{in part due to}} counter-current heat exchange with the deep inhalation of ambient air. Consequently, yawning should be constrained to an optimal thermal zone or range of temperature, i. e., a <b>thermal</b> <b>window,</b> in which we should expect a lower frequency at extreme temperatures. Previous research shows that yawn frequency diminishes as ambient temperatures rise and approach body temperature, but a lower bound to the <b>thermal</b> <b>window</b> has not been demonstrated. To test this, a total of 120 pedestrians were sampled for susceptibly to self-reported yawn contagion during distinct temperature ranges and seasons (winter: 1. 4 °C, n= 60; summer: 19. 4 °C, n= 60). As predicted, the proportion of pedestrians reporting yawning was significantly lower during winter than in summer (18. 3 % vs. 41. 7 %), with temperature being the only significant predictor of these differences across seasons. The underlying mechanism for yawning in humans, both spontaneous and contagious, appears to be involved in brain thermoregulation...|$|E

A complete <b>thermal</b> <b>window,</b> including optimum, transition (Pejus) and critical temperatures (CT), can be described if preferred temperatures and CT are defined. The crustacean Hemigrapsus crenulatus {{was used as a}} model species to evaluate the effect of acclimation temperature on: (i) thermal preference and width of <b>thermal</b> <b>window,</b> (ii) respiratory metabolism, and (iii) haemolymph proteins. Dependant on acclimation temperature, preferred temperature was between 11. 8 °C and 25. 2 °C while CT was found between a minimum of 2. 7 °C (CTmin) and a maximum of 35. 9 °C (CTmax). These data and data from tropical and temperate crustaceans were compared to examine the association between environmental temperature and thermal tolerance. Temperate species have a CTmax limit around 35 °C that corresponded with the low CTmax limit of tropical species (34 – 36 °C). Tropical species showed a CTmin limit around 9 °C similar to the maximum CTmin of temperate species (5 – 6 °C). The maximum CTmin of deep sea species that occur in cold environments (2. 5 °C) matched the low CTmin values (3. 2 °C) of temperate species.

The definitive {{version of}} this article is available at: [URL] large body size and high rates of metabolic heat production associated with male mating success in polygynous systems creates potential thermoregulatory challenges for species breeding in warm climates. This is especially true for marine predators carrying large blubber reserves intended for thermoregulation in cold water and fuel provision during extended fasts. Thermographic images were used to measure changes in skin temperature (TS) in adult male northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) over the breeding season. Environmental variables, primarily ambient temperature and solar radiation, were the principal determinants of mean and maximum TS. When controlled for environmental variables, dominance rank significantly impacted mean TS, being highest in alpha males. Behavioral activity significantly influenced TS but in a counter-intuitive way, with inactive males exhibiting the highest TS. This was likely due to strong impacts of environmental variables on the kinds of behavior exhibited, with males being less active on warm, humid days at peak solar radiation. We classified <b>thermal</b> <b>windows</b> as areas in which TS was one standard deviation greater than mean TS for the individual seal within a thermograph. Thermal features suggest active physiological thermoregulation during and after combat and significant circulatory adaptations for heat dumping, as evidenced by recurring locations of <b>thermal</b> <b>windows</b> representing widely varying TS values. Frequent observations of localized TS above 37 ??C, particularly after combat, suggest the production of thermoregulatory stress during breeding behavior. Our findings demonstrate the importance of environmental drivers in shaping activity patterns during breeding and provide evidence for thermoregulatory costs of successful breeding in large polygynous males.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2009 Infrared {{thermography}} (IRT) {{was used}} to collect baseline information on skin surface temperatures of two species of pinnipeds, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina; n = 6) and the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus; n = 2). The IRT technique was validated against objects of known temperature and through post-collection software manipulation of environmental parameters that influence IRT output (emissivity, distance, relative humidity, ambient temperature and reflected temperature). From February 2007 to February 2008, biweekly measurements were taken of skin surface temperature (FLIR P 25 infrared camera) with subsequent measurements of blubber depth (SonoSite Vet 180 portable imaging ultrasound system) on captive individuals at the Alaska SeaLife Center, Seward, Alaska. Once validated, skin surface temperatures in 10 defined regions (whole body, torso, head, eye, muzzle, shoulder, axillae, hip, fore and hind flipper) {{were used to determine}} seasonal variability as well as consistent hot or cold spots, and of those spots, which may act as <b>thermal</b> <b>windows</b> (defined areas of active heat loss and/or retention). Concurrent measurements of blubber depth were compared to skin surface temperatures at eight body sites to assess: a) the impact of insulation level on skin surface temperature on a site-specific scale, and b) the potential use of IRT as an alternative method for the non-invasive measurement of body condition. Both species varied seasonally in skin surface temperature from winter to reproductive and molt to winter, however, harbor seals had greater regional variation. Similar hot and cold spots were consistently recognized in both species with shoulder, axillae, fore and hind flipper identified as likely <b>thermal</b> <b>windows.</b> While some site-specific significant relationships were found between skin surface temperature and blubber thickness, insulation level alone explained a very small portion of the variance.

40|$|Anthropogenic CO 2 {{emissions}} threaten marine ecosystems {{by increasing}} water temperature and acidification. Fish generally {{seem to be}} less sensitive to elevated CO 2 concentrations due to their efficient ion regulatory capacities. As temperature affects all ion regulatory processes, an increased sensitivity to elevated CO 2 levels {{at the edges of}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>window</b> can be postulated. In this study, we are acclimating Atlantic cod to a combined setup of elevated PCO 2 (390, 1120 and 3000 µatm) and temperatures (10, 15 and 18 °C). In isolated, perfused gill arches we determine the fractional costs of ion regulation, protein and RNA synthesis in relation to the global energy budget after acclimation and under acute exposure by the application of specific inhibitors. Acute warming increased overall gill oxygen consumption rates and fractional costs of the processes investigated, the latter most obvious when combined with hypercapnia. Furthermore, apical Na+/H+ exchangers seem to be essential for the response towards acidification. In isolated gill cells we fluorometrically track the changes of intracellular pH in gill cells after acute exposure to acidification to quantify cellular ion regulative processes and performance. Additionally, ion transport proteins are going to be inhibited to quantify their involvement in the entire regulation process. For the characterisation of the ion regulatory transcriptome and proteome we combine genetic, immunohistological and functional approaches. So far, genes of essential transporters involved in ion regulation have been isolated, and the expression of relevant transporters (NBC 1, AE 1, H+-ATPase, Na+/K+-ATPase) and the capacity of the Na+/K+-ATPase were found seasonally and population specific regulated.
