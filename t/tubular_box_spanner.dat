2500|$|... 1905: Accles & Pollock Produces {{the first}} <b>tubular</b> <b>box</b> <b>spanners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1902 {{the company}} moved to nearby Oldbury, and always listed itself {{as being in}} 'Oldbury, Birmingham'. [...] Here they {{produced}} the first <b>tubular</b> <b>box</b> <b>spanners</b> in 1905, and the first tubular sections for aircraft and the first tubular furniture in 1907. In 1909 two acres of land were acquired in Rounds Green, Oldbury which became Paddock Works. In 1913 they started manufacturing tubular steel shafts for golf clubs, having patented a process for prodicng seamless tapered tubes, but these were banned by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and so these could not be sold in Britain, although their use was permitted in America.|$|R
5000|$|On set-neck {{electrics}} [...] - [...] under a cover-plate {{behind the}} nut. Gibson & Epiphone guitars have their truss rod bolt {{covered with a}} signature bell-shaped plate. Most Gibson electrics have a 5/16” (8 mm) or a 1/4" [...] (6 mm) hex adjustable truss rod nut that can be adjusted with a hex <b>box</b> <b>spanner</b> wrench.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] twin {{cylinder}} engine produced [...] and {{was capable of}} 85 mph. A single camshaft behind the cylinders operated the valves via long pushrods passing through a tunnel in the cast iron block. This system needed {{a considerable number of}} studs and nuts to fasten down the cylinder head and rockerboxes, many of them deeply recessed and requiring well-made <b>box</b> <b>spanners</b> or the then uncommon sockets. As with other British motorcycles of the period, this kind of set-up regularly led to oil leaks.|$|R
50|$|Pininfarina's {{bodywork}} was {{manufactured by}} Ferrari's regular coachbuilder Carrozzeria Scaglietti. Its structure conformed with Ferrari's {{practice at the}} time, with outer body panels fitted onto a separate space-frame chassis constructed from <b>tubular</b> <b>box</b> or oval-shaped steel sections. While most body panels are steel pressings, the front lid and rear engine cover of the Mondial 8 and QV models are from aluminium. Full-width aluminium louvre panels across the front lid and engine cover form a distinctive feature of all Mondials, and provide for improved airflow through the front-mounted radiators and engine bay respectively.|$|R
25|$|Terracotta money boxes {{also has}} been found in {{different}} shapes, such as <b>tubular</b> or <b>boxes,</b> with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifting frame}} was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with <b>tubular</b> and <b>box</b> transverse braces. The lifting frame was fitted with plumbing for fuelling the rocket; wiring for powering and monitoring the rocket and for field telephones; accommodations for carrying and dismounting the rocket; and folding platforms {{to service the}} rocket with rungs to access them.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an internet based survey conducted on members of the UK steel construction industry. The survey was {{in the form of}} an online questionnaire that was open from April to October of 2015. The purpose of the survey was to aid the development of a programme of full scale dynamic testing on UK standard simple and/or semi rigid steel connections. The information that was obtained is of use to both the wider academic community and the steel industry itself. Findings of the survey indicate how often <b>tubular</b> <b>box</b> sections are used on projects, the most popular methods of connecting open sections to box sections, preferred choice of fasteners in blind connections, preferred methods of connecting open section beams to open section columns, how often stainless steel bolts are currently being used on construction projects and finally some additional comments on the design of simple and/or semi-rigid connections are presented that were provided by survey respondents...|$|R
5000|$|The {{specification}} for the wrought-iron <b>tubular</b> <b>box</b> {{girder bridge}} to a design developed and fabricated by William Fairbairn & Sons of Manchester were:" ...one span {{of two hundred}} feet in the clear between the piers, and to consist of three wrought iron tubular girders, each of two hundred feet clear span, supported upon two stone piers twenty-one feet six inches above high water level. Each girder is to have eight feet bearing each end upon the piers, making the total length of each girder two hundred and sixteen feet. The girders are to be placed parallel to each other, and fifteen feet nine inches apart. The roadway is to be carried upon longitudinal sleepers resting upon, and bolted to the angleirons of the cross bearers. The cross bearers are to be of wrought iron, in one length, reaching from outside to outside girder, and riveted to the bottoms of the outside girders, and riveted and bolted also to the centre girder." ...|$|R
50|$|Superficial {{improvements}} such as components, bayonet lugs, {{and minor}} configurations {{led to the}} redesignation of the Type 13 to the Type 18 rifle in 1885. Further modifications {{in the same year}} involving both <b>tubular</b> and <b>box</b> magazines led to the Type 22 rifle, which used a tubular magazine and was reduced to caliber 8mm. The Type 22 was the first Japanese military rifle to utilize smokeless powder and entered military service in 1889.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003, the Rollerblade {{company has}} {{produced}} Dual Box frames under licence from Mogema and has specified Dual Box technology in their high-performance skate product lines. Today, following {{the dissolution of}} Mogema in 2006, Dual Box designer Diederik Hol's own company CadoMotus produces its own skating frames based on an evolution of the Dual <b>Box</b> <b>tubular</b> sidewall.|$|R
50|$|The quad remix of <b>Tubular</b> Bells on <b>Boxed</b> {{was entirely}} {{different}} and true 4 channel sound (later released on SACD). The Boxed-CD version still contains the SQ-encoded quad mixes and plays as normal stereo without a quad decoder. The SQ quad remix Hergest Ridge {{was the only}} version of the album available on CD (until the 2010 Mercury Records reissue, Deluxe Edition), as Oldfield disliked the original vinyl mix.|$|R
50|$|The Morgan Roadster {{is a model}} {{produced}} by the Morgan Motor Company. It was introduced in 2004 replacing the Morgan Plus 8. The car is identical to its predecessor except for new modern Ford V6 mechanicals. The new engine develops similar power, though less torque, and is slightly lighter than the Rover V8 which results in increased performance and better fuel economy. Air conditioning is now standard on U.S. models. Like its predecessor, the chassis consists of a standard ladder frame design and is built from galvanised steel with five <b>tubular</b> or <b>box</b> section cross members. The body is built of steel and aluminum around an ash frame. Suspension is traditional Morgan slider type up-front and solid axle / leaf spring at the rear.|$|R
50|$|A {{truck frame}} {{consists}} of two parallel <b>boxed</b> (<b>tubular)</b> or C‑shaped rails, or beams, held together by crossmembers. These frames {{are referred to as}} ladder frames due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied {{to the top of the}} frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and manufacture of injection molds for high quality technical parts are complex tasks involving {{the knowledge of}} the injection molding process and the material changes induced by processing. In the case of some specific shapes (<b>boxes,</b> <b>tubular</b> fittings), the shrinkage is partially restricted by the mold. The molding shrinks against the core, inserts or pins. Thus, upon ejection, {{it will be necessary to}} overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage. The knowledge of the ejection force is a useful contribution to optimizing the design of molds with these features, and to guaranteeing the structural integrity of the moldings. A study on the effect of conditions on the ejection force required for deep tubular moldings is described for the cases of three common thermoplastic polymers. The studies were based on tubular moldings (60 mm diameter, 146 mm length, and 2 mm. thickness). The injection unit cell consisted of a 1 MN clamp force injection molding machine, thermal regulator, and material dryer. During processing, pressure, temperature and ejection force evolutions were recorded. The results show that the processing conditions noticeably influence the ejection force.

40|$|Pultruded {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymers (GFRP) profile is a promising structural member for space latticed shell structures {{because of the}} advantageous properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio (in pultrusion direction), corrosion resistance and lower maintenance. In particular, when tubular profiles are used, a better resistance against local buckling, global buckling and lateral torsional buckling can be achieved compared with open sections. Despite the advantageous characteristics, the design and fabrication of tubular connections {{has been identified as}} a critical issue for the proposed applications due primarily to the geometric constraints of the closed shape, the distinct material properties of FRP, and the threedimensional nature of space latticed shell structures. Until recently, {{only a limited number of}} connection systems have been proposed for FRP space latticed shell structures and there is still a need to develop a simple, economic and versatile joining method. This thesis proposed a bolted sleeve joint (BSJ) for assembling GFRP tubular profiles into space latticed shell structures. In the proposed BSJ, the FRP profile and steel connector are telescoped and clamped using mechanical bolts. The end of the steel connector can be incorporated with compatible end fittings for connection to a nodal joint for space latticed shell structure. The proposed BSJ allows the flexibility in adjusting design parameters such as the bolt group configuration, memb 9 er size and type of fastener, depending on the design requirements. In addition, all connecting elements are commercially available and no advanced techniques are required for the fabrication. The joint performances were investigated at three level, namely joint level, component level and structural level. Stage one Goint level) focused on the joint design and performance under static axial loadings. Four batches of specimens were prepared and tested under static axial tension and compression. Design parameters, including the type of fastener (ordinary bolt or blind bolt), member size, and bolt group layout, were selected and examined. A simple analytical design model was proposed to estimate the joint capacity, showing good agreement with experiment. Design recommendations based on the current investigation were also made for the further improvement of joint performance. Stage two (component level) was an experimental and numerical study on the member capacity of pultruded GFRP square tubular profile with BSJ end conditions. Three batches of specimens assembled with FRP profiles in different lengths and BSJs at both ends were prepared and tested under static axial compression. A detailed 3 D FE model considering bolt geometry, contact behaviour, bolt pretension, initial geometric imperfection and FRP failure criterion, was developed and validated with experimental results, showing good agreement. The relationship between effective length factor and member slenderness was derived based on FEA, and then used in conjunction with existing pultruded GFRP <b>box</b> <b>tubular</b> column design equations to predict the member capacity of structural members with BSJ end conditions. The final stage (structural level) investigated the performance of BSJ at a structural level. An experimental investigation was first conducted to obtain the M- () behaviour of BSJ. It was followed by a structural analysis and design of an FRP domed roof with BSJ modelled by spring elements using FEA. The inputs of the joint rotational stiffness and axial stiffness for the springs were determined from the linear portions of the orresponding experimental curves. The ULS and SLS performance of the FRP domed roof were evaluated on a LRFD basis under ASCE- 07 design loads. Parametric studies were also performed to identify the effects of joint rotational stiffness, axial stiffness and the materials (steel or pultruded GFRP) used for structural members on the structural performance. Design recommendations were also developed based on the structural analysis and the parametric studies. Awards: Vice-Chancellor’s Commendation for Masters Thesis Excellence in 2015...|$|R
