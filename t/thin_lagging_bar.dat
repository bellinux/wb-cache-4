40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} a tidal bar of the Northern Venice Lagoon, and {{it is based on}} {{investigation}} of aerial photos, sedimentary facies analyses and 3 D modelling. The study of aerial photos highlighted that, since 1968, the bar migrated seaward with a rate of about 20 cm/yr. Moreover the bar migration occurred without any change in sinuosity or bar profile, therefore the bar can be labeled as a translational bar in terms of planform behavior. Bar deposits were studied through 63 sedimentary cores (2 - 3 m deep). These cores were analyzed on the base of facies analyses principles, which allowed to distinguish between saltmarsh, channel <b>lag,</b> <b>bar</b> and subtidal platform deposits. Spatial correlation (3 D modelling) between the main stratal surfaces highlighted that bar accretion was controlled by flood flows, whereas bank retreatment was induced by ebb flows. Finally, it was also noted that bar migration occurred under aggradational conditions, which were linked with vertical growth of the surrounding saltmarshes. ...|$|R
40|$|The polar terrains of Mars {{are covered}} in many places with {{irregular}} pits and retreating scarps, as {{are some of the}} surfaces of the outer-planet satellites. These features are interpreted by us as diagnostic of exogenic degradation due to the loss of a volatile rock-forming matrix or cement. In this study we propose that sublimation degradation is a plausible Solar Systemwide geological process. Candidate examples have been identified on Mars, Io, and Triton, and possibly Europa and Ganymede. We envision this process as having two end-member expressions (pits and scarps), for which we hypothesize two end-member mechanisms (massive localized lenses and areally extensive basal layers). In this study we focus on the role this process may play on the surfaces of the galilean satellites. Our principle modeling results are that for these satellites, H 2 S, CO 2, and NH 3 are the only viable candidate volatiles for sublimation degradation of landforms, in light of galilean satellite cosmochemistry. For Io's polar regions only H 2 S, and then only from slopes that face the Sun and have <b>thin</b> <b>lags,</b> is volatile enough to cause the observed sublimation-induced erosion at those latitudes. SO 2 is not a viable candidate as an agent of erosion, especially for these polar landforms. In the case of Europa, only CO 2 and H 2 S are viable candidates (given surface age constraints). Both species could be efficient eroders in nonpolar regions. H 2 S could generate erosion within the polar regions if the deposition and erosion conditions were essentially identical as those we invoked for Io's polar regions. For Ganymede (and Callisto) NH 3 might be an agent of erosion in equatorial terrains of great age. The sublimation of CO 2 and H 2 S is much more robust than NH 3. The much slower rate of sublimation degradation from NH 3 might be detectable by Galileo and used as a compositional indicator...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA flash that is {{presented}} {{adjacent to a}} continuously moving bar is perceived to <b>lag</b> behind the <b>bar.</b> One explanation for this phenomenon {{is that there is}} a difference in the persistence of the flash and the bar. Another explanation is that the visual system compensates for the neural delays of processing visual motion information, such as the moving bar, by spatially extrapolating the bar’s perceived location forward in space along its expected trajectory. Two experiments demonstrate that neither of these models is tenable. The first experiment masked the flash one video frame after its presentation. The flash was still perceived to <b>lag</b> behind the <b>bar,</b> suggesting that a difference in the persistence of the flash and bar, does not cause the apparent offset. The second experiment employed unpredictable changes in the velocity of the bar including an abrupt reversal, disappearance, acceleration, and deceleration. If the extrapolation model held, the bar would continue to be extrapolated in accordance with its initial velocity until the moment of an abrupt velocity change. The results were inconsistent with this prediction, suggesting that there is little or no spatial compensation for the neural delays of processing moving objects. The results support a new model of temporal facilitation for moving objects whereby the apparent flash lag is due to a latency advantage for moving over flashed stimuli...|$|R

Below of a marine succession containing a dinoflagellate cyst assemblage that characterizes the C/G palynological zone of the Chenque Formation (early Miocene), a 80 – 110 m thick marine succession contains a palynological assemblage integrated by Gelatia inflata, Diphyes colligerum and Reticulatosphaera actinocoronata supporting the occurrence of a marine incursion in the basin during the Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT). The new lithostratigraphic unit - here defined as El Huemul Formation – covers in sharp contact to the Sarmiento Formation, and become thinner from East to West; the unit has been identified in about 1800 well logs covering up to 3500 km 2, and its subsurface distribution exceed {{the boundaries of the}} study area. The El Huemul Formation consists of a <b>thin</b> <b>lag</b> of glauconitic sandstones with fining-upward log motif, followed by a mudstone-dominated succession that coarsening-upward to sandstones, evidencing a full T-R cycle. Preservation of the El Huemul Formation in the subsurface of the South Flank has been favored by the reactivation of WNW-ESE late Cretaceous normal faults, and by the generation of N–S striking normal faults of Paleocene-Eocene age. Flexural loading associated to igneous intrusions of Paleocene?- middle Eocene age also promoted the increase of subsidence in the South Flank of the basin prior to the transgression.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{stratigraphy}} {{of the newly}} defined mid-Carboniferous boundary. The selection of the mid-Carboniferous stratotype section should reconcile problems between the different mid-Carboniferous biostratigraphies developed throughout the world and provide a standard against which other successions can be correlated. The nature of the mid-Carboniferous boundary in the Clare Basin has been investigated. Various geochemical analyses have been conducted on a mid-Carboniferous section {{and it has been}} possible to construct a chart relating these various geochemical parameters to relative sea-level. It is shown that although deposition is complete through the interval, there is a geochemical expression of a lowstand during the lowest Chokierian. Additionally, doubt is cast on the presumption that all sediments deposited outside 'marine bands' are non marine. A model has been developed for mid-Carboniferous deposition in the Clare Basin. It is envisaged that the shelves of the Clare Basin were flooded during the early Namurian leading to an environment suitable for phosphate authigenesis. During a major regression in the Pendleian/lower Arnsbergian the phosphate was reworked into a lag. The lowstand of the basal Chokierian is marked by a <b>thin</b> <b>lag</b> on the shelves, whilst deposition was continuous in the basin centre. Later Chokierian times are marked by a widespread transgression. The mid-Carboniferous stratotype has been chosen at Arrow Canyon,Nevada. Microfacies studies show that deposition was on a winnowed carbonate platform showing reworking of bioclasts. Faunal diversity and eveness studies have also been conducted on this section. No drop in diversity is seen at the mid-Carboniferous boundary, although a drop in eveness is seen, whether this relates to a specialised fauna or selective winnowing of bioclasts is unknown. Correlations between America and western Europe show that conodonts are strongly facies controlled and {{it is unlikely that the}} appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus is truly isochronous between sections, and thus is an unwise choice for defining the mid-Carboniferous boundary. Additionally it is suggested that Arrow Canyon was a poor choice for the stratotype section due to both the possibility of reworking, the presence of an unconformity in the section and possible doubts over the conodont record at this locale. The Rhachistognathus minutus zone is recognized as a new conodont zone across the Arnsbergian/Chokierian boundary...|$|R
40|$|We study, using {{direct orbit}} integrations, the {{kinematic}} {{response of the}} outer stellar disk {{to the presence of}} a central bar, as in the Milky-Way. We find that the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) causes significant perturbations of the velocity moments. With increasing velocity dispersion, the radius of these perturbations is shifted outwards, beyond the nominal position of the OLR, but also the disk becomes less responsive. If we follow Dehnen (2000) in assuming that the OLR occurs just inside the Solar circle and that the Sun <b>lags</b> the <b>bar</b> major axis by 20 ^∘, we find (1) no significant radial motion of the local standard of rest (LSR), (2) a vertex deviation of 10 ^∘ and (3) a lower ratio σ^ 2 _ 2 /σ^ 2 _ 1 of the principal components of the velocity-dispersion tensor than for an unperturbed disk. All of these are actually consistent with the observations of the Solar-neighbourhood kinematics. Thus it seems that at least the lowest-order deviations of the local-disk kinematics from simple expectations based on axisymmetric equilibrium can be attributed entirely to the influence of the galactic bar.

This succession indicates a decrease in energy conditions at the bed during the period of deposition and a subsequent slow regional rise in sea-level. Most probably the succession is a drape over an originally irregular seabed. Moreover, the Holocene thickness is less than 2. 5 m in the swales between the sandbanks, indicating possible source areas where gravel can be found...|$|R
40|$|The Nelson Boulder Bank, a 13 km long gravel barr ier, {{is located}} in a {{relatively}} low energy environment on the southeast side of Tasman Bay, New Zealand. The barri er, composed of well rounded clasts of a single lithology, has two distinct gravel units: 1) a gravel ridge which consists of actively moving and well-sorted pebbles and cobbles, and 2) a gravel platform which is exposed only at low tide and conta ins poorly sorted cobbles and boulders. Ridge gravels are actively tran sported by waves, but boulders on the platform surface are immobile and occur as a <b>thin</b> erosional <b>lag</b> overlying smaller, clast-supported polymictic gravels. This erosional sur face, the immobility of the boulders, and the extent of the platform gravels cannot be explained by longshore drift. An in situ-transgressive barrier model suggests that platform gravels of the Boulder Bank derive from a buried ridge of granodiorite that lies seaward of the Boulder Bank. As sea level rose prior to 6. 5 ka, former beach gravels buried the ridge and transgressed over estuarine muds which were accumulating in the valley behind the ridge. This has resulted in a long, shore-parallel gravel barrier that has previously been interpreted as a spit formed by longshore drift...|$|R

This study was initiated to determine how organic carbon-rich materials were being delivered to the sediment–water interface, {{and what happened to}} them after deposition, prior to deep burial. Analyses of the fabrics present shows that they exhibit many common attributes. In particular they are all: (1) highly heterogeneous on the scale of a thin section, (2) organized into thin beds (, 10 mm thick) composed mainly of mineral mixtures of fine-grained siliciclastic detritus and carbonate materials, and (3) contain significant concentrations of organic carbon, much of which is organized into laminasets that contain abundant organomineralic aggregates and pellets. In addition, framboidal pyrite (range of sizes from, 20 mm to, 1 mm) and abundant agglutinated foraminifers are present in some units. The individual beds are commonly sharp-based and overlain by <b>thin,</b> silt <b>lags.</b> The tops of many of the beds have been homogenized and some regions of the pelleted laminasets contain small horizontal burrows.

Marine or marginal marine successions in three Neoproterozoic formations, the Sonia Sandstone in western India, and the Sirbu Shale and Upper Bhander Sandstone in central India have been examined here for this purpose. The strikingly common feature of all three formations is vertical stacking of highstand systems tracts without intervention of any significant transgressive deposits. In one instance only, the transgressive systems tract is represented by a <b>thin</b> granular transgressive <b>lag,</b> and in all other cases the evidence of transgression is simply marked by the presence of marine flooding surfaces. The absence of transgressive strata relates to the low sea floor gradients, which facilitated rapid transgressions, combined with a generally low sediment supply.

The Swift comprises two unconformably bounded sequences: the shale member and ribbon sandstone. The shale member consists dominantly of shale with uncommon hummocky-cross-stratified siltstone. Comprising at least four parasequences that show a subtle upward-fining stacking pattern, it was deposited in an overall deepening, fully marine environment during the fourth Jurassic transgression across the Western Interior of North America.

40|$|The Gulf of Tonkin {{coastline}} migrated at {{an average}} rate of ca 60 m year− 1 landward during Holocene sea-level rise (20 to 8 ka). Due {{to a combination of}} rapid coastline migration and undersupply of sand, neither coastal barriers nor tidal sand bars developed {{at the mouth of the}} Red River incised valley. Only a 30 to 80 cm thick sandy interval formed at the base of full-marine deposits. Thus, the river mouth represented a mud-dominated open funnel-shaped estuary during transgression. At the base of the valley fill, a <b>thin</b> fluvial <b>lag</b> deposit marks a period of lowered sea-level when the river did not reach geomorphic equilibrium and was thus prone to erosion. The onset of base-level rise is documented by non-bioturbated to sparsely bioturbated mud that occasionally contains pyrite indicating short-term seawater incursions. Siderite in overlying deposits points to low-salinity estuarine conditions. The open funnel-shaped river mouth favoured upstream incursion of seawater that varied inversely to the seasonal strongly fluctuating discharge: several centimetres to a few tens of centimetres thick intervals showing marine or freshwater dominance alternate, as indicated by bioturbational and physical sedimentary structures, and by the presence of Fe sulphides or siderite, respectively. Recurrent short-term seawater incursions stressed the burrowing fauna. The degree of bioturbation increases upward corresponding to increasing marine influence. The uppermost estuarine sediments are completely bioturbated. The estuarine deposits aggraded on average rapidly, up to several metres kyr− 1. Siphonichnidal burrows produced by bivalves, however, document recurrent episodes of enhanced deposition (> 0 · 5 m) and pronounced erosion (< 1 m) that are otherwise not recorded. The slope of the incised valley affected the sedimentary facies. In steep valley segments, the marine transgressive surface (equivalent to the onset of full-marine conditions) is accentuated by the Glossifungites ichnofacies, whereas in gently sloped valley segments the marine transgressive surface is gradational and bioturbated.

Excavations around the edge and in the centre of the former clay-pit revealed sediments infilling a lake basin that had formed in Lowestoft till, overlying Chalk, the till being attributed to the Anglian glaciation (MIS 12). The lake sediments contain pollen that can be assigned to pollen zones HoI and HoIIa of the early Hoxnian (MIS 11). Overlying grey clays contain ostracods, molluscs, vertebrates, and carbonate concretions. Together they are indicative of a fluvial environment in a temperate climate. AAR ratios (amino acid racemisation) on the molluscs also suggest correlation with MIS 11.

Central to our analysis is the construction of the first and second moments of the velocity distribution in their spatial variability. From these, other important quantities like Oort constants, dispersion axis ratio and vertex deviation can be deduced. For the latter, we predict non-vanishing values for a large number of kinematical configurations. Regarding the axis ratio, we are able to obtain values smaller than 1 / 2, in agreement with observations in the solar neighbourhood which are hitherto unexplained by theory.

50|$|Perception {{of motion}} is also confounded by an inverse problem: {{movement}} in three-dimensional space does not map perfectly onto {{movement on the}} retinal plane. A distant object moving at a given speed will translate more slowly on the retina than a nearby object moving at the same speed, and as mentioned previously size, distance and orientation are also ambiguous given only the retinal image. As with other aspects of perception, empirical theorists propose that this problem is solved by trial-and-error experience with moving stimuli, their associated retinal images {{and the consequences of}} behavior. One way to test this hypothesis is by seeing whether it can explain the flash lag illusion, a visual effect in which a flash superimposed on a moving bar is falsely seen to <b>lag</b> behind the <b>bar.</b> The task for empirical theorists is to explain why we perceive the flash in this way, and further, why the perceived lag increases with the speed of the moving bar. To investigate this question, Wojtach et al. (2008) simulated a three-dimensional environment full of moving virtual particles. They modeled the transformation from three dimensions to the two-dimensional image plane and tallied up the frequency of occurrence of particle speeds, particle distances, image speeds, and image distances (image meaning the path projected across the computer-modeled “retina”). The probability distributions they obtained in this way predicted the magnitude of the bar-flash disparity quite well. The authors concluded that the flash-lag effect was a signature of the way brains evolve and develop to behave appropriately in response to moving retinal images.|$|R

Condensin is involved in chromosome organisation during meiotic and mitotic cell divisions. Three condensin subunits, including condensin I and II specific subunits AtCAPD 2 and AtCAPD 3 respectively, have been studied for their role in meiosis using T-DNA insertion plants and an RNAi approach. The condensin subunit AtSMC 4 localised to meiotic chromosomes at metaphase I, where it coated the entire chromosome and remained until telophase. Some evidence of centromere localisation of AtSMC 4 was also seen during prophase I and metaphase I. AtSMC 4 RNAi lines were able to condense their chromosomes into metaphase bivalents which were essentially normal. However at anaphase the chromosomes appeared to lose structural integrity such that a <b>thin</b> curtain of <b>lagging</b> chromatin was seen to trail behind the segregating chromosomes. As in AtSMC 4 RNAi lines, both condensin I and II specific subunits were also required for chromosome segregation at anaphase I and II. However their roles in this process differed.

Based on the terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) dating of 18 sackung scarps supported by one radiocarbon-dated scarp, we reconstructed the post-glacial chronology of sackungen in the Tatra Mts. (central Europe, Slovakia and Poland), the highest part of the Carpathians. The obtained ages (- 15. 7 - 4. 3 ka) indicate that sackungen post-date the regional LGM {{and some of them}} originated soon after the glacier withdrawal from adjacent valleys. Furthermore, systematic decrease of scarp ages with their increasing altitude suggests a direct link between sackung origin and post-LGM glacier <b>thinning.</b> However, substantial <b>lag</b> (> 5 ka) of some sackungen in respect to glacier retreat implies complex relationships between sackung onset and deglaciation where retreat of glaciers acted predominantly as a preparatory, not a triggering factor during the genesis of these slope deformations. They originated either as a consequence of stress relaxation within the rock mass lasting several ka or alternatively could be triggered by climatic processes or seismicity. Indeed, a significant part of sackung activity took place during predominantly warmer and more humid periods, with some dates coinciding with the Belling-Allerod chronozone, but especially with the onset of the Holocene and the Holocene Climatic Optimum. Earthquake triggering is less probable, as the Tatra Mts. lack significant modern and historic seismic activity and there is no geomorphic evidence of fault offsets on the Late Quaternary landforms. In concert with other recent studies, we propose that large rock slope failures in high mountains seldom react immediately to glacier withdrawal, but could display temporal delay lasting up to several millennia.

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a very suitable tool for the study of fluids on the atomic level. Many MD studies have been devoted to the behavior of homogeneous, unconfined fluids under either simple shear or extensional flows, while a combination of both flow types has not been studied extensively. We use MD simulations and analysis tools for: (1) the study of various properties of a simple homogeneous bulk fluid under several planar velocity fields, (2) the calculation of stresses and viscosity using the transient-time correlation function and, (3) the study of properties of an inhomogeneous fluid confined in a nanochannel. The data suggest that the pressure tensor for a homogeneous, simple, monoatomic fluid under any planar flow field can be expressed in a unified form as a combination of equilibrium properties and non-Newtonian phenomena, such as: strain <b>thinning</b> viscosity, viscoelastic <b>lagging,</b> pressure dilatancy and out-of-flow plane anisotropy. We found consistent trends for these non-Newtonian quantities. Also, interesting trends have been found for equilibrium material properties as a function of density. It is often not possible to directly compare experimental data to results from steady non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Calculating accurate time-averaged values from these simulations is usually only feasible at deformation rates that are much larger than those accessible in experiments. We have shown that the transient-time correlation function provides a more efficient alternative to direct time-averaging of NEMD data. Furthermore, Non-Newtonian stresses have been studied for a simple monoatomic fluid confined in a nanochannel, where the properties vary across the channel. Data for various densities, temperatures and body forces have provided insight in the dependencies of various quantities...|$|R
40|$|Accurate dating is {{necessary}} to get insight in the temporal variations in sediment deposition in floodplains. The interpretation of such dates is however dependent on the fluvial architecture of the floodplain. In this study we discuss the fluvial architecture of three contrasting Belgian catchments (Dijle, Geul and Amblève catchment) and how this influences the dating possibilities of net floodplain sediment storage. Although vertical aggradation occurred in all three floodplains during {{the last part of}} the Holocene, they differ in the importance of lateral accretion and vertical aggradation during the entire Holocene. Holocene floodplain aggradation is the dominant process in the Dijle catchment. Lateral reworking of the floodplain sediments by river meandering was limited to a part of the floodplain, resulting in stacked point bar deposits. The fluvial architecture allows identifying vertical aggradation without erosional hiatuses. Results show that trends in vertical floodplain aggradation in the Dijle catchment are mainly related to land use changes. In the other two catchments, lateral reworking was the dominant process, and channel <b>lag</b> and point <b>bar</b> deposits occur over the entire floodplain width. Here, tracers were used to date the sediment dynamics: lead from metal mining in the Geul and iron slag from ironworks in the Amblève catchment. These methods allow the identification of two or three discrete periods, but their spatial extent and variations is identified in a continuous way. The fluvial architecture and the limitation in dating with tracers hampered the identification of dominant environmental changes for sediment dynamics in both catchments. Dating methods which provide only discrete point information, like radiocarbon or OSL dating, are best suited for fluvial systems which contain continuous aggradation profiles. Spatially more continuous dating methods, e. g. through the use of tracers, allow to reconstruct past surfaces and allow to reconstruct reworked parts of the floodplain. As such they allow a better reconstruction of past sedimentation rates in systems with important lateral reworking. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Early Cretaceous, Barremian – Aptian Helvetiafjellet Formation {{is a well}} exposed paralic {{succession}} deposited at ramp-type {{shelf of}} the Borealic sea in the Svalbard region. The Ullaberget section in the Van Keulenfjorden area is an important reference section for the formation, due to excellent exposures and great variation in facies associations. The formation is in this locality subdivided in a lower, middle and upper portion. The lower boundary of the Helvetiafjellet Formation is a subaerial erosional unconformity, cut into the open-marine black shale of the Late-Jurassic – Early-Barremian Janusfjellet Subgroup. The erosional boundary {{is marked by a}} <b>thin,</b> discontinuous <b>lag</b> of fluvial channel conglomerate with extrabasinal clasts {{at the base of the}} Ullaberget Member. The Ullaberget Member is here suggested to be a tidally influenced delta introducing the Helvetiafjellet Formation, and not representing the top unit of the Rurikfjellet Formation in the Janusfjellet Subgroup, as previously published. The erosional unconformity represents a regional sequence boundary. The “Ullaberget delta” is a small delta, 11 - 18 m thick with an internal clinoform set, possibly formed as a bay-head delta during early sea level rise. The delta top facies is marked by a slight erosion which represents a bay or lacustrine ravinement surface which is succeeded by lacustrine or brackish-water mudstone, thin coal beds and thin crevasse or interdistributary bay sandstone units, overlain by thin fluvial channel sandstone beds. Crevasse and interdistributary bay sandstones have dinosaur foot imprints. The middle portion of the Helvetiafjellet Formation is up to 50 m thick and comprises the major part of the Helvetiafjellet Formation. The lower boundary is a transgressive ravinement surface capped by up to 12 m thick lentoid sandstone bodies with large sets of planar cross-stratification showing tidal influence. These bodies are interpreted as formed as tidal sand ridges of a local estuary. The ridges are overlain by heterolithic mudstone and thin sandstone bed facies association, interpreted to have formed in small tidal channels within an intertidal mudflat and in a lower coastal plain environment. Some shale beds are supposed to be of marine bay origin, thus representing intermittent events of marine flooding. The facies arrangement within the middle portion reveals a vertically stacked pattern of parasequences, balanced by a rather constant A/S ratio. The upper portion of the formation is characterized by a more complex retrogradational parasequence set. Its lower boundary is put at the first marine flooding surface below fully marine strata. The parasequences include lagoonal mudstone, marine embayment mudstone, tidal channel infill and marine sandstone beds. The marine sandstone beds, up to about 1 m thick, are characterized by large Diplocraterion burrows, probably formed during storm events, also being supported by hummocky stratification in some of the sandstone beds. The upper boundary of the Helvetiafjellet Formation is put at the onset of fully marine conditions without any further paralic facies interruptions. These facies associations characterize the Aptian – Albian Carolinefjellet Formation. As an analog to paralic sandstone reservoirs, The Helvetiafjellet Formation in the Ullaberget section gives an interesting insight into rapid lateral and vertical variability and complexity of sandstone body geometries in such a marginal marine environment...|$|R
40|$|Snøhvit {{field is}} located in the SW Barents Sea and {{comprises}} a reservoir in Lower to Middle Jurassic sandstones of Stø Formation containing gas with <b>thin</b> oil <b>lag.</b> The sandstones of Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic Nordmela and Tubåen Formations have also shown gas in few wells. Several stages of uplift and erosion of the entire region resulted in dramatic changes in reservoir rock properties and petroleum system. Hence, analysis of this sedimentary basin as a normally subsiding basin would mislead the exploration results. An integrated approach that incorporates compaction analysis, rock physics diagnostics, AVO modeling and post-stack seismic inversion has been carried out to predict reservoir properties of the Snøhvit field. Six exploration wells drilled in the study area and three 2 D seismic lines have been considered for detail compaction, AVO modeling inversion and detail rock physics analyses. Naturally compacted rocks in the well 7121 / 5 - 1 indicate transformation in compaction domain (MC to CC) at present depth 1922 m (BSF) corresponding to present day temperature of 66 ⁰C. An abrupt velocity increase at this depth is inferred as a result of grain framework stiffening related to precipitation of micro-quartz cement. The higher velocity-depth gradient of this sediment than laboratory experimental curves is related to the burial history and subsequent uplift. However, the estimated exhumation in the studied area varies between 300 and 760 m. The present day temperature of well 7121 / 5 - 1 at transition depth after exhumation is 93 ⁰C which is quite enough to change the rock stiffness. But, the present day temperature (50 ⁰C) at transition depth in well 7120 / 5 - 1 indicates the paleo-temperature history in this basin was different. The velocity of the Stø Formation in the eastern well is lower than the western well. The eastern well is located more close to the shore line which may control deposition of coarse and well sorted sediments. Hence, the influence of compaction (both mechanical and chemical) is lower in the east than west. However, the reservoir quality of the Stø Formation is decreasing from east to west. Moreover, the reservoir quality is changing because of vertical lithological alterations. The rock physics template is not good for lithology identification, but good enough for fluid separation. The stø reservoir in the studied area has been overconsolidated. Hence, the fluid separation using the rock physics template is very difficult and risky (in exploration phase). The sensitivity analysis of different fluid saturations indicates substantial change of effective rock properties when added only 10 % gas into a gas-water system, mainly because of changing the effective fluid modulus. Higher gas saturation (50 and 90 %) has slightly changed the fluid modulus as resulted from synthetic seismic traces. The lateral variation of the cap rock (Fuglen Formation) elastic properties greatly controls the AVO characteristics of the reservoir rock (Stø Formation). Lithological heterogeneity and lateral thickness variation changed the AVO response. The diagenetic changes (different depth level reservoirs) within reservoirs also affect AVO responses. Moreover, the AVO gas sand classes based on reflectivity and intercept-gradient cross-plots have given a quick preliminary AVO evaluation of the Stø reservoirs. The post-stack seismic inversion shows the low impedance within the reservoir (Stø Formation) zone compared to the upper and lower units. Moreover, inversion is useful to track laterally the lower impedance hydrocarbon filled reservoirs. Thus, it can be concluded that the geophysical techniques help to understand the reservoir, leading to its proper management and better evaluation of new structural and stratigraphic prospects for exploration and development planning...|$|R
40|$|The Outer Thames Estuary Regional Environmental Characterisation (REC) {{provides}} an environmental reference statement defining marine and seabed conditions within the study area. Prior to this study, regional environmental {{assessment of the}} Outer Thames Estuary was based upon dispersed data acquired over several decades. The Marine Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF) has provided the opportunity to acquire and interpret an integrated physical and biological dataset {{for the first time}} in this region. The dataset was acquired along geophysical survey transects spaced 10 – 20 km apart and grab samples were recovered at the intersection of survey lines. The Outer Thames Estuary REC provides a unique, robust scientific basis to define the regional marine environment, outlining the character of seabed conditions in the study area. This will permit informed, confident and consistent decision-making and consequently the Outer Thames Estuary REC will be of value to all stakeholders including government, marine industry, planners and environmentalists. The knowledge will contribute to the protection of the marine environment, promote the sustainable management of the seabed and focus future development investment. The Outer Thames Estuary REC develops the approach initially adopted in previous marine aggregate regional characterisation studies but also makes a comprehensive assessment of the heritage issues. The characterisation process begins by reviewing the physical conditions in the area, for example tides, currents, seabed geology and seabed sediment transport. The heritage assessment has been combined with the interpretation of the Quaternary geology to produce an integrated assessment, whilst the wreck and other modern archaeology are treated separately. Analysis of the benthic infauna and epifauna communities is combined with an evaluation of their associated physical conditions to produce a habitat and biotope assessment. The principle characterisation is supplemented with high-level summaries of marine mammals, birds and anthropogenic activities for context. The characterisation process also highlights regional environmental sensitivities, for example sites of potential conservation, fisheries or heritage significance, as well as informing marine spatial planning. Geology and Heritage The seabed consists of three distinct morphological zones. The Western Zone is dominated by a large coast-parallel sandbank system. The sandbanks are composed of well sorted fine-medium grained sand whilst sandy gravels lie on the seabed in the troughs between the banks. The Central Zone consists of a bedrock platform typically overlain by a discontinuous, <b>thin,</b> gravelly <b>lag</b> deposit, dispersed sandy bedforms and isolated sandbanks. Two parallel, north-south trending troughs, the Inner Gabbard Deeps, have been eroded into the bedrock in this zone. The seabed in the Eastern Zone consists of an extensive sand dune field. In general there is a net seabed sediment transport to the south across the area. The Outer Thames Estuary REC survey has revealed a geological and archaeological record of previously unquantified significance. The combined interpretation of bathymetry of varying resolutions, sub-bottom data, a limited amount of core and grab material and a full review of the extant geological and archaeological record, has achieved a significantly enhanced interpretation of the Outer Thames Estuary. Of central importance is the identification of c. 1, 500 km 2 of submerged palaeo-landscape dating from c. 720, 000 BP. This represents a significant feature of both geological and archaeological interest. The seabed in the Outer Thames Estuary mainly comprises a thin, superficial layer of mobile and immobile sediments overlying exposures of Quaternary, Cenozoic and Cretaceous sediments. Ten enclosed deeps are identified and interpreted as being formed at the margin of the Elsterian-Anglian glacial maximum ice limit. The stratigraphic relationship of these features with the major eastwest river system (the Thames-Medway) that cuts across the Outer Thames Estuary REC area suggests this channel must have been incised prior to this glaciation (Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 12 : c. 450 kaBP). Further, the spatial correlation of this channel system with terrestrial river terrace gravels on the Essex coast suggests it may have been formed as early as Cromerian Complex II (OIS 18 : c. 720 kaBP), but at least by OIS 15 (c. 600 kaBP). The southern edge of the Outer Thames Estuary REC area does cross the northern margin of the post-Elsterian/Anglian Thames-Medway river courses as they migrate southwards and separate to become the modern Thames and Medway systems. Again, through spatial correlation with the terrestrial record, c. 40 m thick sections of river channel infill sediments have been identified, which may hold a record of 450, 000 years of sedimentation. The Outer Thames Estuary REC study reveals a potentially highly significant record from an archaeological perspective. There are two broad categories of submerged archaeological material that may potentially exist within the Outer Thames Estuary REC area: shipwreck sites and terrestrially deposited archaeological material subsequently inundated by rising sea levels. In terms of the wreck record 1, 576 individual incidents are documented for the area, with an additional seven anomalies identified as a part of the characterisation process. The wrecks for which details were available date from between AD 1320 – 2005, and range in type from fishing vessels, through submarines, to second world war aircraft. Available survey data only covered a small proportion of the total area considered, and as such the location of only c. 6 % of wrecks recorded in the UKHO could be verified. With regard to submerged terrestrially deposited archaeology, the Outer Thames Estuary REC area parallels one of the most important stretches of coastline for Palaeolithic archaeology in the British Isles. Bracketed by the key internationally significant Lower Palaeolithic sites of Clacton (to the south) and Pakefield (to the north), the coastline in this region has produced evidence for the earliest occupation of the British Isles at c. 600 – 700, 000 BP. As such, the determination of a large area of submerged landscape dating from 720, 000 BP offshore of these sites is deemed to be highly significant and worthy of future investigation to evaluate its potential. This determination is based on the value of this landscape as a resource to inform about the broader changes which occurred through the Pleistocene and into the Holocene, as much as the possibility for preservation of primary and secondary context archaeological material. In addition, there is a third class of archaeological material found within the survey area; the modern terrestrial feature of Walton-on-the Naze Pier which extends c. 17 m into the Outer Thames Estuary REC. This is a significant local feature and forms part of a conservation area...|$|R
