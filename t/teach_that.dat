5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> entire sanctification was less a process {{and more of}} a state that one entered into by faith at a definite moment in time. This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E

5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible to have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
50|$|The Nation of Gods and Earths <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> {{black people}} are the {{original}} people of the planet Earth, and therefore they are the fathers ("Gods") and mothers ("Earths") of civilization. The Nation <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> Supreme Mathematics and Supreme Alphabet, a set of principles created by Allah the Father, {{is the key to}} understanding humankind's relationship to the universe. The Nation does not believe in a mystery God but instead <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the Asiatic Blackman is God and his proper name is Allah, the Arabic word for God.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind placing prayer {{notes in the}} Wall has been traced to the Midrashic <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts.|$|R

5|$|The Shaiva Puranas, {{particularly}} the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the {{various aspects of}} Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty four monism Agama texts.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E
50|$|The LDS Church <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> abusive behavior, whether physical, sexual, verbal, or emotional, {{is a sin}} and is {{condemned}} unreservedly by the church.

50|$|Lutheranism <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the Bible {{presents}} all doctrines and commands of the Christian faith clearly; that God's Word is freely {{accessible to}} every reader or hearer of ordinary intelligence, without requiring any special education. It also <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> readers {{must understand the}} language God's Word is presented in, and not be so preoccupied by contrary thoughts so as to prevent understanding. It <b>teaches</b> <b>that,</b> consequently, no one needs to wait for any clergy, and pope, scholar, or ecumenical council to explain the real meaning of {{any part of the}} Bible.|$|R
