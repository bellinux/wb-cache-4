40|$|Abstract Keyword based {{queries are}} {{inherently}} ambiguous such that given {{a set of}} keywords the database search engine has only an uncertain guess about the user’s informational need represented by the query. Possibly high complexity of the data makes providing intelligent search results effectively extremely challenging. Databases enable users to precisely express their informational needs using structured queries. However, database query construction is a laborious and error-prone process, which cannot be performed well by most end users. Keyword search alleviates the usability problem {{at the price of}} query expressiveness. As keyword search algorithms do not differentiate between the possible informational needs represented by a keyword query, users may not receive adequate results. <b>This</b> <b>paper</b> <b>presents</b> <b>Extended</b> Incrementa...|$|E

The EDLS framework switches between DLS and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) depending on the panel mode, which may be transmissive or reflective, and the remaining battery energy. This paper analyzes the energy gain from the backlight and the overhead of EDLS in view of application transparency and hardware-software trade-offs, which visualize the systematic approach for the efficient EDLS implementation. As a result, we demonstrate a compact EDLS system that relies on approximate histogram construction, thereby, achieving a significant reduction in the area and power overhead of the EDLS system with negligible loss of the energy savings in the backlight system. Overall, the compact EDLS system results in an average of 25 % power saving in the backlight system for still and moving images, without any modification of the existing applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{programs}} {{are notorious for}} containing errors {{that are difficult to}} reproduce and diagnose at run-time. This motivated the development of type systems that statically ensure the absence of some common kinds of concurrent programming errors including data races and atomicity violations. A method is atomic if every execution of the concurrent program is equivalent to an execution in which the atomic method is executed without being interleaved with other concurrently executed methods. Atomicity is a common correctness requirement in concurrent programs; atomicity violations may indicate incorrect synchronization. <b>This</b> <b>paper</b> <b>presents</b> <b>Extended</b> Parameterized Atomic Java (EPAJ), a type system for specifying and verifying atomicity in Java programs. EPAJ combines Flanagan and Qadeer’s atomicity types [11] with a new and significantly more expressive type system for analyzing data races, called Extended Parameterized Race-Free Java (EPRFJ), allowing a more accurate analysis of atomicity. The paper also presents a type discovery algorithm to automatically obtain EPRFJ types, and a static interprocedural type inference algorithm that, given EPRFJ types, infers atomicity types. These algorithms can be incorporated into testing and debugging tools, benefiting users who know nothing about type systems. We report our experience with a prototype implementation...|$|E

The focus is laid on the development and analysis of ASR front-end technologies covering speech enhancement and feature extraction. Speech enhancement is performed using a joint noise reduction and dereverberation system in the spectral domain based on estimates of the noise and late reverberation power spectral densities (PSDs). To obtain reliable estimates of the PSDs—even in acoustic conditions with positive direct-to-reverberation energy ratios (DRRs) —we adopt the statistical model of the room impulse response explicitly incorporating DRRs, as well in combination with a novel proposed joint estimator for the reverberation time T 60 and the DRR. The feature extraction approach is inspired by processing strategies of the auditory system, where an amplitude modulation filterbank is applied to extract the temporal modulation information. These techniques were shown to improve the REVERB baseline in our previous work. Here, we investigate if similar improvements are obtained when using a state-of-the-art ASR framework, and to what extent the results depend on the specific architecture of the back-end. Apart from conventional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) -hidden Markov model (HMM) back-ends, we consider subspace GMM (SGMM) -HMMs as well as deep neural networks in a hybrid system. The speech enhancement algorithm is found to be helpful in almost all conditions, with the exception of deep learning systems in matched training-test conditions. The auditory feature type improves the baseline for all system architectures. The relative word error rate reduction achieved by combining our front-end techniques with current back-ends is 52. 7 % on average with the REVERB evaluation test set compared to our original REVERB result...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relative}} and incremental information content of a cash recovery-based measure of performance, the estimated internal rate of return, vs an earnings-based measure of performance, return on assets, in explaining firms' economic performance. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the cash recovery rate that is based on continuous time analysis and U-shaped cash flows to derive the estimated internal rate of return and compare it to return on assets. A cross-sectional sample was used over a short interval (year 1993 and year 2005) and a time-series sample (1993 - 2005) to empirically examine the relative and incremental information content of the competing measures. Tobin's q and stock returns are used as performance benchmarks. Findings – The results of the empirical tests indicate that the estimated internal rate of return provides better relative and incremental information content over earnings-based measures of performance. Specifically, the empirical evidence shows that the estimated internal rate of return is consistently positively related to Tobin's q and stock returns over all measurement intervals. Research limitations/implications – These results imply that earnings-based performance measures are less value relevant compared to cash recovery-based measures. There are some limitations that may apply to this study. First, the systematic measurement error in estimating the cash recovery rate may not be independent of the measurement error in the estimated internal rate of return. Second, the performance benchmarks used in the study are not free from problems. Particularly, the return on assets is influenced by firms' rate of growth and the Tobin's q is not a perfect measure of business performance. Therefore, one avenue of future research is to assess the usefulness of financial accounting data for analysts forecast. Moreover, future research may also examine the role of institutional changes in financial reporting and its effect on the quality of earnings and economic performance.
