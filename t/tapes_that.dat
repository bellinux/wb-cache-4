5|$|In this episode, Piz (Chris Lowell) {{gets the}} chance to {{interview}} {{one of the members}} of his favorite band, a washed-up rock star named Desmond Fellows (Paul Rudd). However, when Desmond's backing <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> he needs for the show the next night disappear, Veronica is called in to find them. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) enlists Mac's (Tina Majorino) help in creating a presentation for his business class. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) learns that Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) is challenging him in the upcoming Sheriff election.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2003, GSN {{was allowed}} to air the episodes, {{including}} a few previously edited-out portions, {{as part of a}} two-hour documentary called Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal, hosted and narrated by Tomarken. The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with Lionsgate and FremantleMedia, the latter of which now owns the rights to Press Your Luck), and broke all previous viewership records for the network. The Big Bucks documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master <b>tapes,</b> <b>that</b> had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast. The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Bill Carruthers, producer/creator of Press Your Luck, who had died before the airing.|$|E
5|$|In {{their final}} mission, the killer7 seek Matsuken, {{who leads the}} 10 million UN Party members {{who live in the}} US. The {{government}} fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's memories were lost.|$|E

He {{stated that he}} had found information via the Nixon <b>tapes,</b> <b>that</b> showed what the burglars were after: information on a kickback scheme involving the Democratic National Convention in Miami, Florida. Dean also asserts that Nixon did not directly order the break-in, but that it was ordered by Ehrlichman on behalf of Nixon.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Amos was 17, Amos had a stock of {{homemade}} demo <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> her father regularly {{sent out to}} record companies and producers. Producer Narada Michael Walden responded favorably: he and Amos cut some tracks together, but none were released. Eventually, Atlantic Records responded {{to one of the}} tapes, and, when A man Jason Flom flew to Baltimore to audition her in person, the label was convinced and signed her.|$|E
25|$|The Coltrane family {{reportedly}} possesses {{much more}} unreleased music, mostly mono reference tapes {{made for the}} saxophonist, and, as with the 1995 release Stellar Regions, master <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> were checked out of the studio and never returned. The parent company of Impulse!, from 1965 to 1979 known as ABC Records, purged much of its unreleased material in the 1970s. Lewis Porter has stated that Alice Coltrane intended to release this music, but {{over a long period}} of time; Ravi Coltrane is responsible for reviewing the material.|$|E
25|$|This {{compilation}} set {{came about}} {{as a result of}} the initially rushed conversion of Led Zeppelin's album to the compact disc format in the late 1980s. Led Zeppelin were among the first rock bands to be re-issued on CD, but such was the haste to capitalise on the new format that the new CDs were derived not from re-equalised master tapes, but from sound-generation <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> had been equalised for the original vinyl platters. For this 1990 reissue, Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer Jimmy Page himself supervised the mastering process, which was based on Led Zeppelin's archive of master tapes.|$|E

25|$|During this time, the FBI had {{intensified}} {{its efforts}} against the Gambino family, and in August 1983, {{three members of}} Gotti's crew – Angelo Ruggiero, John Carneglia, and Gene Gotti – were indicted for heroin trafficking. Castellano was against anyone in the family dealing narcotics. Castellano planned to kill Gene Gotti and Ruggiero if he believed they were drug traffickers. Castellano asked Ruggiero {{for a copy of}} the government surveillance <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> had Ruggiero's conversations. To save Gene Gotti and Ruggiero, Dellacroce stalled the demand. Eventually, {{one of the reasons for}} Gotti's killing Castellano was to save his brother and Ruggiero. The FBI had bugged Ruggiero's house and telephone, and Castellano decided he needed copies of the tapes to justify his impending move to Dellacroce and the family's other capos.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the {{compilation}} was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity {{as a result of}} the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes. Bray decided to cash-in the publicity for the release, although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album. He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added [...] "There's nothing in these <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> would be embarrassing, and just hoping that she would like it as much as we do." [...] In the European countries, the album was re-titled as In the Beginning, featuring different artwork, and a re-arranged track list.|$|E
500|$|While {{fighting}} Milhouse, Bart {{picks up}} a robotic toy which unfolds into an axe. Milhouse {{picks up a}} similar toy, but it instead unfolds into a watering can. The toys {{are based on the}} franchise Transformers. While fighting, Milhouse and Bart fall through a poster that hides a room in The Android's Dungeon. While the poster depicts American actress Rita Hayworth as the Marvel Comics superheroine She-Hulk, the scene is a reference to the 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption, in which the main character escapes a prison by digging a tunnel in his wall behind a poster. One of the <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> Bart and Milhouse watch shows Fred Rogers intoxicated. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean later met Rogers' wife at a hall of fame, and said that he was [...] "really embarrassed" [...] when he found out that she had seen the episode.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement <b>Tapes</b> <b>that</b> sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E
500|$|Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a shy fifteen-year-old {{student at}} Plainsboro High School, New Jersey with a {{pronounced}} stutter. Beginning in late 2004, Rocket Sciences producers traveled to several American and Canadian cities {{looking for an}} actor to play the lead role of Hal. At one point, Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal, but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface. HBO Films told the producers {{after six months of}} searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks, at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> he had been sent and [...] "knew immediately we had a promising candidate" [...] when he saw Thompson's tape. Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13–18 who had a stutter and could also act, Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter. However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style, knowing he was going to block up on a particular word and looking for ways to work round it. Before filming, Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist.|$|E
500|$|The band {{began to}} grow {{suspicious}} that Secor was keeping the money from selling the tape, and contacted their lawyer – Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. The group informed as Escalante that they believed [...] "someone's bootlegging it," [...] and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Escalante's label, Kung Fu, to re-release Buddha on compact disc. The band had told Secor to not sell any more copies of the tape, but they held suspicions that he had anyway. Anonymously, Escalante ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. The band asserted {{that they were not}} receiving royalties for these sales. [...] "I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of <b>tapes</b> <b>that</b> I had of Buddha," [...] said Secor in 2001. [...] "It was about 25. The tapes sold for five bucks, and I gave them half of what their profit would be. I wanted to have a few to give to people and to have on hand." [...] Secor felt it was his right to sell his stock of the tape, as the band [...] "had been paid royalties for that already." ...|$|E
