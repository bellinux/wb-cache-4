5|$|Another {{unsuccessful}} {{assassination attempt}} {{took place on}} 25 October, when Lugovoy and Kovtun flew to London again. They left radioactive traces again in their hotel prior to meeting Litvinenko, but did not administer the poison, perhaps due to security cameras in the meeting room. They again disposed of the poison via their room's <b>toilet,</b> and left London.|$|E
5000|$|Squat <b>toilets</b> {{are often}} used as public <b>toilets,</b> rather than {{household}} <b>toilets,</b> because they are perceived as easier to clean and more hygienic, therefore more appropriate for general public use.

25|$|In 2004 the queues {{outside the}} <b>toilets</b> became {{so long that}} the police had to {{regulate}} access. To keep traffic moving through the <b>toilets,</b> men headed for the <b>toilets</b> were directed first to the urinals (giant enclosed grates) if they only needed to urinate. Consequently, the number of <b>toilets</b> was increased by 20% in 2005. Approximately 1,800 <b>toilets</b> and urinals are available today.|$|R
5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand.

On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second <b>toilet</b> break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E

They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family <b>toilet.</b> When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the <b>toilet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Composting <b>toilets</b> {{are more}} {{difficult}} to maintain than other types of dry <b>toilets,</b> like urine-diverting dry <b>toilets</b> (UDDT) with which they are often confused. This is due to the need to maintain a consistent and relatively high moisture content, as well as the relatively high complexity of composting <b>toilets</b> compared to UDDTs. Apart from that, composting <b>toilets</b> are quite similar to UDDTs, sharing many of the same advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, pay <b>toilets</b> tend to {{be common}} at bus and rail stations, but most public <b>toilets</b> are free to use.

Pay <b>toilets</b> on the streets may provide urinals free of charge to prevent public urination.

5|$|Detailed {{instructions}} in relatively small print for various technological devices appear at several {{points in the}} film, the most visible of which are the lengthy instructions for the zero-gravity <b>toilet</b> on the Aries Moon shuttle.
