5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

On his return, he was {{appointed}} the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26th Infantry Division. While he commanded the division, General K. S. Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what he thought of his chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to think of his chief in that way, and told Menon not to ask anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You can get rid of him. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> get another."

500|$|By February 1938 Reich's visa had expired.

[...] The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: [...] "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" [...] Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were [...] "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science," [...] and from A.S. Neill, founder of Summerhill, a progressive school in England, who argued that [...] "the campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized, more like fascism than democracy..." ...|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{was known}} for having a dynamic vocal range, and was {{described}} as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she [...] "could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language." [...] She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, {{the language of the}} apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated [...] "When Afrikaaners sing in my language, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> sing theirs." [...] English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride.|$|E

500|$|FC Barcelona had a {{successful}} start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final. In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president {{in a desperate attempt}} to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905.

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, {{the album}} {{contains}} [...] "raspy braggadocio and sexy rhymes" [...] which complement Queen's raspy vocals.

She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she wants it to demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist. Describing the songs, she said [...] " [...] {{are always going to be}} real because they are feelings that people have...The hits that I have now, the girls love them because they are real.

500|$|While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he {{was only}} repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the {{concession}} itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna, Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the Mazoe valley, the king replied [...] "Take my men to England for me; and when you return, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> talk about that."

500|$|According {{to former}} {{president}} Victor Yushchenko the March 9, 2010 parliamentary amendment {{that made it}} possible for individual members of a parliamentary faction to join a coalition violated the Ukrainian Constitution, former Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko accused Yanukovych of [...] "trying to buy members of parliament for a new coalition" [...] (President Viktor Yanukovych accused Lutsenko of badly handling the affairs at the Ministry of Internal Affairs before appointing Anatolii Mohyliov to Lutsenko's old position.) and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc lawmaker Serhiy Mishchenko stated [...] "that the Verkhovna Rada had shown to the average citizen a bad example of how to violate the country’s laws and Constitution". Yushchenko did sent a letter to Yanukovych with a request to veto the law on March 10. Yanukovych signed the law nevertheless. 56 lawmakers filed a challenge to the law who made these amendments possible on March 11, 2010 at the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. On March 16, 2010 Minister of Justice Oleksandr Lavrynovych stated that even if the Constitutional Court rules the amendments unconstitutional the format of the Ukrainian parliamentary coalition will remain unchanged because [...] "the Constitutional Court's ruling becomes valid on the day of its announcement, not yesterday or the day before yesterday" [...] and the Constitutional Court's ruling will apply only to measures intended to establish a new coalition in Ukraine in the future. On March 26, 2010 President Yanukovych told a delegation from the European Parliament [...] "If the decision of the Constitutional Court will be that the coalition was formed illegally, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> take a decision on a snap election, I will never go down the path of breaching the constitution that is in force". The Constitutional Court reviewing the case late March 2010. On urgent matters the court rules within weeks but on matters deemed less urgent it can take months or even longer. On March 29, 2010 former premier and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc leader Yulia Tymoshenko accused [...] "Representatives of Yanukovych" [...] of trying to bribe and blackmail Constitutional Court judges {{in order to get a}} ruling that legitimates the coalition and the government. This was denied by Yanukovych's Party of Regions.|$|E
