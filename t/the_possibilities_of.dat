5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop became interested in <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the instrument, hoping it {{would allow them to}} increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{had already}} experimented with filming outside {{the context of}} a {{standard}} rock concert, including an hour-long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970. Adrian Maben had become interested in combining art with Pink Floyd's music, and during 1971, he attempted to contact the band's manager, Steve O'Rourke, to discuss <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> making a film to achieve this aim. After his original plan of mixing the band with assorted paintings had been rejected, Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer.|$|E

5|$|Sir Clive Sinclair's {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> electric vehicles {{originated in the}} late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solatron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he {{was the head of}} his own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.|$|E
5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} that focused on <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E

5|$|After reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic, the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm's path. Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island, Rhode Island south to Savannah, Georgia on September7 due to the threat of rough seas. After Carrie stalled on September11, the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight chance of being affected by the storm, but <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards. After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were warned of the oncoming hurricane. Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags. After passing Bermuda, the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia, but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Banks and Rutherford {{suggested}} the band take an extended hiatus, hoping Collins would save his marriage {{and that the}} band could work with him in Vancouver. Banks recorded a solo album A Curious Feeling in Polar Studios, Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album, Smallcreep's Day, at the same studio. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album Face Value {{at his home in}} Shalford, Surrey. As well as playing piano and synthesizers, he had recently picked up a Roland drum machine and become interested in <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> electronic drums.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E

5|$|For Native Americans, Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> pan-tribal {{cooperation in}} resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war {{also saw the}} first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E

5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> deadly disease, mass {{infection}} and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, Luigi Russolo, the Italian Futurist {{painter and}} composer, wrote of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> new music in his 1913 manifestoes The Art of Noises and Musica Futurista.

One {{of the most influential}} events in early 20th century music was the return of Alfredo Casella from France in 1915; Casella founded the Società Italiana di Musica Moderna, which promoted several composers in disparate styles, ranging from experimental to traditional. After a dispute over the value of experimental music in 1923, Casella formed the Corporazione delle Nuove Musiche to promote modern experimental music.|$|E

5|$|Television's {{debut album}} Marquee Moon, {{released}} in 1977, is frequently {{cited as a}} seminal album in the field. The no wave movement that developed in New York in the late 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance, is often treated as the phenomenon's U.S. parallel. The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post-punk. One {{of the most influential}} American post-punk bands was Boston's Mission of Burma, who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context. In 1980, Australia's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party, which evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Led by the Primitive Calculators, Melbourne's Little Band scene would further explore <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> post-punk. Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post-punk predecessors, as they did among their new wave contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|The PKWN was {{reshaped}} {{into the}} Provisional Government (Rząd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej; RTRP), which functioned from January 1945. This government was headed by Edward Osóbka-Morawski, a socialist, but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees, such as Michał Rola-Żymierski, held {{a majority of}} key posts. In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> future Western or émigré impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland. The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa; KRN), formed by Gomułka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej; RJN).|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw some major {{engineering}} projects including Thomas Telford's (1757–1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829–31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812–14). In the 1850s <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored {{in the building}} of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–6), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856-8, using massive rubble blocks.|$|E
