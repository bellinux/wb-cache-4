5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from <b>taxonomies</b> of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a {{flat file}} {{plaintext}} format to represent and store data which is typically {{referred to as}} EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as <b>taxonomies</b> {{as defined by the}} NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as AC to label the accession number and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with //.|$|E
30|$|The base <b>taxonomy</b> is an empirically based <b>taxonomy,</b> i.e. it was {{designed}} based on existing literature and also on the knowledge of several experts. Our extended <b>taxonomy</b> {{is based on the}} base <b>taxonomy,</b> two systematic empirical studies and expert knowledge. Gumm’s <b>taxonomy</b> was based on a non-systematic literature review. Thus, Gumm’s <b>taxonomy</b> lacks the empirical basis as compared to our extended <b>taxonomy</b> and the base <b>taxonomy.</b>|$|R
30|$|When {{analyzing}} the classification results presented in Tables 2 and 3, the base <b>taxonomy</b> classification coverage {{is equal to}} 42 % (lack of seven dimensions) {{when compared to the}} extended <b>taxonomy,</b> while Gumm’s <b>taxonomy</b> is able to cover only 25 % (lack of nine dimensions). This means that the dimensions that are relevant to describe GSE research contexts in a more comprehensive way are only covered by the extended <b>taxonomy.</b> In summary, the base <b>taxonomy</b> and the <b>taxonomy</b> by Gumm are subsets of the extended <b>taxonomy.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{identified}} seven {{dimensions to}} extend and incorporate into the recently proposed GSE <b>taxonomy.</b> The resulting extended <b>taxonomy</b> was later on validated by comparing {{it with the}} existing <b>taxonomy</b> on which the extension is built and one additional <b>taxonomy.</b> We also demonstrated {{the utility of the}} extended <b>taxonomy</b> using it to classify eight finished real GSE projects.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between a standard (base) <b>taxonomy</b> and a custom (extension) <b>taxonomy</b> {{is important for the}} auditor. A standard <b>taxonomy</b> is normally owned, created and published by the government or regulator. It {{is the responsibility of the}} government or regulator to create a <b>taxonomy</b> that is correct. The quality of a standard <b>taxonomy</b> is fixed input for the auditor. The auditor just needs to check -with help of software tools- that the right <b>taxonomy</b> is used. With a custom (extension) <b>taxonomy</b> this is not the case. The auditor needs to validate the custom (extension) <b>taxonomy,</b> a secondary audit object. He needs to perform an audit to check if this <b>taxonomy</b> complies with regulations and if it is accurate and complete.|$|R
40|$|For any {{information}} to be organized, <b>taxonomy</b> is essential. <b>Taxonomy</b> plays {{a very important role}} for information and content management.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to revisit the Panko-Halverson <b>taxonomy</b> of {{spreadsheet}} errors and suggest revisions. There are several reasons for doing so: First, the <b>taxonomy</b> has been widely used. Therefore, it should have scrutiny; Second, the <b>taxonomy</b> has not been widely available in its original form and most users refer to secondary sources. Consequently, they often equate the <b>taxonomy</b> with the simplified extracts used in particular experiments or field studies; Third, perhaps as a consequence, most users use only a fraction of the <b>taxonomy.</b> In particular, they tend not to use the <b>taxonomy's</b> life-cycle dimension; Fourth, the <b>taxonomy</b> has been tested against spreadsheets in experiments and spreadsheets in operational use. It is time to review how it has fared in these tests; Fifth, the <b>taxonomy</b> was based on the types of spreadsheet errors that were known to the authors in the mid- 1990 s. Subsequent experience has shown that the <b>taxonomy</b> needs to be extended for situations beyond those original experiences; Sixth, the omission category in the <b>taxonomy</b> has proven to be too narrow. Although this paper will focus on the Panko-Halverson <b>taxonomy,</b> this does not mean that that it is the only possible error <b>taxonomy</b> or even the best error <b>taxonomy.</b> Comment: 22 Pages, 17 Figure...|$|R

30|$|<b>Taxonomy</b> {{was also}} {{developed}} by bloom which became famous as “bloom taxonomy” {{to develop a}} method of classification for thinking behavior that {{was considered to be}} important in learning process which concluded to three domain of <b>taxonomy.</b> (1) The cognitive (a knowledge-based domain having six levels). (2) The affective (altitudinal-based domain having five levels). (3) The psychomotor (skill based-domain having six levels) (Forehand 2010). In the continuation of above bloom <b>taxonomy,</b> bloom’s digital <b>taxonomy</b> was developed in which domain of learning are further elaborated as low order thinking skill and high order thinking skill (Churches 2012). <b>Taxonomy</b> was applied in knowledge and knowledge system in organization where <b>taxonomy</b> was based on four criteria namely structure (how knowledge is designed and what it contain), purpose (what is knowledge for), function (what the knowledge does) and disciplinary content (Geisler 2006). <b>Taxonomy</b> development for knowledge management was also described in seven steps which include define requirements, identify concepts, develop draft <b>taxonomy,</b> review with user and SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), refine <b>taxonomy,</b> apply <b>taxonomy</b> to content and finally manage and maintain <b>taxonomy</b> (Whittaker and Breininger 2008). <b>Taxonomy</b> in the field of manufacturing was also developed in which <b>taxonomy</b> was created on the basis of type of process, state of work piece material, nature of processing energy (Todd et al. 1994).|$|R
25|$|There are two higher-order {{factors that}} both <b>taxonomies</b> clearly share: {{extraversion}} and neuroticism.

25|$|The rufous fantail has complex {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} sometimes {{this results in}} conflicting taxonomy. This is not uncommon since <b>taxonomies</b> are merely hypotheses of a species' evolutionary status. Debate is still currently ongoing about the taxonomic treatment of the rufous fantail's subspecies and its related species.|$|E
25|$|Many lower-order factors, or facets, {{are similar}} {{between the two}} <b>taxonomies.</b> For instance, both {{approaches}} contain factors for sociability/gregariousness, for activity levels, and for assertiveness within the higher order factor extraversion. However, there are differences too. First, the three-factor approach contains nine lower-order factors and the five-factor approach has six.|$|E
50|$|The term {{standard}} <b>taxonomy</b> is here used in {{the context}} of clear ownership. A standard <b>taxonomy</b> is owned by an authoritative body and responsibility for the quality is taken by the owner. Obvious <b>taxonomy</b> owners are governments, regulators and standard setters. Ownership can be linked with creation, maintenance, publication and/or certification of the <b>taxonomy.</b> A custom <b>taxonomy</b> is not owned by an authoritative body.|$|R

25|$|Eysenck's psychoticism factor {{incorporates}} some of {{the polar}} opposites of the lower order factors of openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness.

25|$|The {{two most}} widely used <b>taxonomies</b> now used are the Tholen {{classification}} and SMASS classification. The former was proposed in 1984 by David J.

In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in {{a modified version of}} the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the M-type. There are also several smaller classes.|$|E
25|$|Labyrinthodontia {{has fallen}} out of favor in recent <b>taxonomies</b> because it is paraphyletic: the group does not include all the {{descendants}} of their most recent common ancestor. Various groups that have traditionally been placed within Labyrinthodontia are currently variously classified as stem tetrapods, basal tetrapods, non-amniote Reptiliomorpha and as a monophyletic or paraphyletic Temnospondyli, according to various cladistic analysis. This reflects the emphasis of ascertaining lineage and ancestral-descendant relatedness in modern-day cladistics. The name does however linger as a handy reference for the early amphibian tetrapods, and as an apt anatomical description of their distinct tooth pattern. Thus it remains in use as an informal term of convenience by some modern scientists.|$|E
