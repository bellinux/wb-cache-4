5|$|Between 1962 and 1972, the <b>Test</b> <b>Pilot</b> School {{expanded}} its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era {{were selected for}} the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs. Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries. An exchange program allows selected students to attend other <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> schools including the United States Naval <b>Test</b> <b>Pilot</b> School, the United Kingdom's Empire Test Pilots' School, and France's EPNER.|$|E

In October 1956, he entered USAF <b>Test</b> <b>Pilot</b> School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and returned to Wright-Patterson AFB in May 1957 as a <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> assigned to the fighter branch.|$|E

5|$|All {{production}} aircraft were flight tested before delivery. During the Second World War, Jeffrey Quill was Vickers Supermarine's chief <b>test</b> <b>pilot,</b> {{in charge of}} flight-testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine. He oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area. Quill devised the standard testing procedures which, with variations for specific aircraft designs, operated from 1938. Alex Henshaw, chief <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> at Castle Bromwich from 1940, was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory. He co-ordinated a team of 25 pilots and also assessed all Spitfire developments. Between 1940 and 1946, Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires, more than 10% of total production.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} his wings {{in the summer}} of 1936. He met Jimmy Rawnsley at this time, a 32-year-old electrical engineer who would later serve as aerial gunner and radar operator on all but three of John's successful air battles. Cunningham subsequently became a junior <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> with de Havilland, working with light aircraft alongside Geoffrey de Havilland, the company founder's son and chief <b>test</b> <b>pilot.</b> The company was short of test pilots and Cunningham caught the eye of de Havilland as his flight experience grew. It was reflected by his promotion to flying officer on 5 December 1937. At this time John began to care more for test-flying than manufacture and design. He became one of four of de Havilland's top test pilots.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} {{landed on the}} summit plateau of Helvellyn and took off again. The plane was an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> who worked for A V Roe, the plane's manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and {{the first}} person to walk on the Moon. He was also an {{aerospace}} engineer, naval aviator, <b>test</b> <b>pilot,</b> and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|Normally sea duty alternated with {{periods of}} duty ashore. In 1950, Shepard was {{selected}} to attend the United States Naval <b>Test</b> <b>Pilot</b> School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. As a <b>test</b> <b>pilot</b> he conducted high-altitude tests to obtain information about the light and air masses at different altitudes over North America; carrier suitability certification of the McDonnell F2H Banshee; experiments with the Navy's new in-flight refueling system; and tests of the angled flight deck. He narrowly avoided being court-martialed by the station commander, Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride, after looping the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and making low passes over the beach at Ocean City, Maryland, and the base; but Shepard's superiors, John Hyland and Robert M. Elder, interceded on his behalf.|$|E

The current evaluation further evaluated the effects of symbology by <b>testing</b> <b>pilots</b> in a high-fidelity simulator, executing more operational tasks. Flight performance and subjective ratings from six experimental <b>test</b> <b>pilots</b> were collected.

5000|$|Geoffrey Crisp is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{that is an}} amalgam of Vickers's <b>test</b> <b>pilots,</b> Jeffrey Quill (also an RAF veteran) and [...] "Mutt" [...] Summers. Having one character personify the <b>test</b> <b>pilots</b> is a liberty that gives the story narrative coherence, {{as well as a}} narrator and occasional comic relief. The character embodies all those who gave Mitchell encouragement in the face of bureaucratic opposition. The Observer wrote, [...] "Oddly enough, since Mitchell was a real man and Crisp is merely a symposium of <b>test</b> <b>pilots,</b> an imaginary creation, it is Mitchell who seems the figment, Crisp the flesh-and-blood character. David Niven's flippant assurance is just right here. The real-life story is the more real for his imagined presence; he gives the rather abstracted film a body." ...|$|R
