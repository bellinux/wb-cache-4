5|$|A non-tropical low {{pressure}} area developed about 240miles (390km) south-southwest of Bermuda on April 18 through the interaction of an upper-level trough and a surface frontal trough. The surface trough, which extended from the gale center to Hispaniola, brought a plume of moisture northward from the Caribbean Sea into the circulation, which caused heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico. The non-tropical low tracked generally northward, with a ridge to its east and west, and on April 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center; early that day, satellite imagery indicated {{the presence of a}} tight inner core of winds. After turning to the northwest, it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system, due to <b>the</b> <b>deepening</b> of the upper-level trough over the system. Convection became better organized over the center, and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on April 20 while located about 250miles (400km) west of Bermuda. Operationally, the subtropical cyclone was not classified by the National Hurricane Center until 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by <b>the</b> <b>deepening</b> of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in <b>the</b> <b>deepening</b> twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E

5|$|From the {{eleventh}} through the fourteenth centuries, urban development at Gedi expanded {{primarily to the}} north, west and south with the eventual shift of the population around the Great Mosque during the fifteenth century. Gedi's population and prosperity peaked during the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century until it and many other coastal sites began to decline in the late-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Gedi was abandoned {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century. The presence of the Portuguese from the sixteenth century has been considered one of the primary factors in Gedi's eventual abandonment with their attempts to monopolize trade and due to armed intervention. However, a drop in the water table seen with <b>the</b> <b>deepening</b> of the well next to the Great Mosque, a Wazimba raid along the coast in 1589, and Galla migrations and raids from Somalia may have been additional factors in the abandonment of Gedi an most of the mainland coastal sites north of Mombasa.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{continued}} and expanded Roosevelt's efforts {{to break up}} business combinations through lawsuits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act, bringing 70 cases in four years (Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years). Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company, initiated under Roosevelt, were decided {{in favor of the}} government by the Supreme Court in 1911. In June 1911, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into United States Steel (U.S. Steel). That company had been expanded under Roosevelt, who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company as a means of preventing <b>the</b> <b>deepening</b> of the Panic of 1907, a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings. Taft, as Secretary of War, had praised the acquisitions. Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company, but it was in fact a bargain. For Roosevelt, questioning the matter went to his personal honesty.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Snow {{hurricane}} (also {{known as}} the Storm of October1804) was the first tropical cyclone in recorded history known to produce snowfall, with Hurricane Ginny in 1963 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 being the next such systems to do so. An unusual late-season storm in 1804, it yielded vast amounts of snow, rain, and powerful winds across the northeastern United States. Prior to its approach towards the East Coast of the United States, it passed through the Caribbean Sea on 4October, and later emerged near Georgetown, South Carolina. By early on 9 October, a trough near the Virginia Capes turned the disturbance toward New England. Soon thereafter, the hurricane's abundant moisture clashed with an influx of cold Canadian air, leading to <b>the</b> <b>deepening</b> of the resulting pressure gradient and provoking inland intensification. While situated over Massachusetts, it attained its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), undergoing an extratropical transition. Even as it drifted towards the Canadian maritimes, consequently gradually weakening, precipitation persisted for another {{two days before the}} snowstorm finally subsided on 11October.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deepening</b> {{economic}} crisis caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E
