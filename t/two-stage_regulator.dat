40|$|The {{open circuit}} {{underwater}} breathing apparatus {{can be a}} one or <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulator</b> used in scuba diving or a <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulator</b> used in surface supplied installations. These installations are proper in underwater sites at small depth. The pneumatic circuit of a <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulator</b> is composed mainly of a first stage regulator mounted on the air cylinders and a second stage carried by the diver in his mouth. The two regulators are linked together by a medium pressure hose. The circuit opens when the depression created by the diverâ€™s inhalation, in the second stage body, reaches a certain value. The second stage opening causes a transient movement, namely an expansion wave that propagates through the medium pressure hose to the first stage regulator. The first stage regulator opens and {{the air in the}} cylinders is allowed to flow to the diver. The longer the hose, the greater the duration of the expansion wave propagation. Investigations on the wave propagation offer data on the inspiration unsteady motion duration which influences the respiratory effort of the diver...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} of the ignition-containment capability of 12 oxygen regulators contaminated by various levels of hydrocarbon oils and subjected to promoted ignition. The regulators inlets were pressurized to 15. 2 MPa with gaseous oxygen, and the oil was ignited by an electrical arc located upstream of the test article inlet port; the flame was allowed to propagate with the oxygen flow throughout the regulator internal cavities. The resulting reactions, which ranged in character from complete containment of the promoted ignition for one <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulator</b> to extensive burning and explosive energy release for several other (both single- and double-stage) regulators, indicate the need to prevent oil from being introduced into regulators...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the design and {{development}} of the Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) for the International Space Station (ISS). The emphasis of the paper is the collaborative effort between The Boeing Company and Cobham in the crafting of the architecture of the system to meet NASA's requirements. Specific examples to be discussed include the inclusion of the pneumatic isolation valve for compliance with safety requirement, the inclusion of a single stage regulator with flow limiter versus a <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulator,</b> and the use of integrated assemblies as opposed to separate valves/regulators. The paper will also discuss NORS experience with integrated assemblies (common body) verses prior ISS hardware and Cobham trade study efforts, to include lessons learned and potential applications to future programs...|$|E
25|$|Most {{contemporary}} diving <b>regulators</b> are single-hose <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulators.</b> They {{consist of}} a first-stage regulator, and a second-stage demand valve. An intermediate-pressure hose connects these components to transfer air, and allows relative movement within the constraints of hose length and flexibility. Other intermediate-pressure hoses supply optional additional components.|$|R

25|$|These unusual {{regulators}} {{were designed}} by Robert J. Dempster and made at his factory in Illinois, USA, from 1961 to 1965. The Demone Mark I and Demone Mark II are both <b>two-stage</b> <b>regulators.</b> The second-stage looks like the mouthpiece of a twin-hose regulator but has a small diaphragm on the front. The second-stage valve is inside the mouthpiece tube. The exhaled air goes into a corrugated coaxial exhaust hose which surrounds the intermediate-pressure hose and discharges about 60% of {{the way back to}} the first-stage to keep the bubbles away from the diver's face. Near the mouthpiece is a one-way valve to let outside water into the exhaust hose to avoid free flow if the diaphragm (at the mouth) is below the open end of the exhaust hose. The Mark I has hoses only on one side, and the Mark II has twinned intermediate-pressure hoses, each with its own coaxial exhaust hose and second stage, one assembly on each side of the diver's head, but with both second stages in the same mouthpiece housing and operated by the same diaphragm. This version has no large visible regulator.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} regulator is called as Chowaki or harmonizing {{system for the}} engine, it actually is a <b>two-stage</b> pressure <b>regulator</b> with twin pressure-tunable regulation valves. It steps down the pressure of compressed air at 215 - 50 atm (3,000 - 711 psi) in the air chamber to the constant high-pressure air at 10 atm (142 psi). While the air pressure is declining as the torpedo is running under the water, the {{pressure regulator}} feeds the constant high-pressure air to the engine intake aspirator and keeps the constant running speed in 43 knots (or 80 km/h, 50 mile/h).|$|R
40|$|The Variable Oxygen Regulator (VOR), a stepper {{actuated}} <b>two-stage</b> mechanical <b>regulator,</b> {{is being}} developed {{for the purpose of}} serving as the Primary Oxygen Regulator (POR) and Secondary Oxygen Regulator (SOR) within the Advanced EMU PLSS, now referred to as the xEMU and xPLSS. Three prototype designs have been fabricated and tested as part of this development. Building upon the lessons learned from the 35 years of Shuttle/ISS EMU Program operation including the fleet-wide EMU Secondary Oxygen Pack (SOP) contamination failure that occurred in 2000, the VOR is being analyzed, designed, and tested for oxygen compatibility with controlled Non-Volatile Residue (NVR) and a representative worst-case hydro-carbon system contamination event (> 100 mg/sq ft dodecane). This paper discusses the steps taken in testing of VOR 2. 0 with for oxygen compatibility and then discusses follow-on design changes implemented in the VOR 3. 0 (3 rd prototype) as a result...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a novel <b>two-stage</b> low dropout <b>regulator</b> (LDO) that minimizes output noise via a pre-regulator stage and achieves high power supply rejection via a simple subtractor circuit {{in the power}} driver stage. The LDO is fabricated with a standard 0. 35 um CMOS process and occupies 0. 26 mm 2 and 0. 39 mm 2 for single and dual output respectively. Measurement showed PSR is 60 dB at 10 kHz and integrated noise is 21. 2 uVrms ranging from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. I...|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the twin hose regulator is packaged in a usually circular metal housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver's neck. The demand valve component of a <b>two-stage</b> twin hose <b>regulator</b> is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The supply hose is connected {{to one side of the}} regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a non-return valve, and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a non-return valve on the other side of the mouthpiece and usually through another non-return exhaust valve in the regulator housing - often a [...] "duckbill" [...] type.|$|R
