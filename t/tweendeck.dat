The Irish Poplar and her near sister operated on the North Atlantic Liner trade {{for most of their}} lives. The Irish Poplar was sold in 1972. Irish Spruce, Steam Turbine, delivered in 1957, was a near sister of the Irish Poplar. Both of these vessels were equipped with refrigerated cargo <b>tweendecks</b> for the carriage of meat. The Irish Spruce ran aground in the Caribbean in 1972 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the engine}} rooms, boiler rooms and {{machinery}} workshops remain largely in their initial configuration and one officer cabin on the <b>tweendeck</b> was spared {{by the fire}} in the 1940s, the aim of the restoration work was never to return Tarmo to her original condition. Instead, she was rebuilt as she appeared after her last major refit in 1951, although with modern heating and air conditioning systems. Her hold was turned into an exhibition space and a cafeteria was opened in the crew mess. Although she was not repaired to operational condition – her stern engine was decoupled from the propeller shaft and equipped with an electrical turning gear – there are no permanent changes that would prevent her from ever sailing under her own power.|$|E
25|$|A {{multipurpose}} {{general cargo}} ship, the vessel {{was capable of}} carrying {{a wide variety of}} cargo ranging from general and dry bulk cargoes to containers, heavy cargo, long goods and trailers. The ship had five holds fitted with tweendecks, four forwards and one abaft of the superstructure. The ship, designed to serve the remote arctic regions, was also equipped with flexible winterized cargo handling equipment for loading and unloading in undeveloped ports. For loading and unloading of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ship was geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. On the continuous <b>tweendeck</b> the ship could also carry roll-on/roll-off cargo which was loaded and unloaded via a stern quarter ramp that could also be lowered directly on ice.|$|E
25|$|Some {{modifications}} {{were made}} to cargo spaces and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold {{was turned into a}} refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The <b>tweendeck</b> hatch covers were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the deck crane in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the general arrangements of the lowest accommodation deck.|$|E
5000|$|Open Hatch General Cargo, {{abbreviated}} OHGC), is a ship {{designed to}} transport forest products, Bulk cargos, unitized cargoes, project cargoes and containers.

5000|$|Cofresí's {{life and}} death have {{inspired}} several myths and stories. These included those depicting him as a generous figure, who used to share what he stole with the region's poor population. In these myths he is generally described as a benevolent person, with authors writing about his supposed personality. Others take note of his purported sense of humor. In general, these portray him as a noble gentleman who became a pirate out of necessity or as a generous man, claiming that on one occasion he provided money for the upbringing of a baby girl that he had saved. Others depict a brave man, showing disregard for his life on several occasions. The [...] "generous thief" [...] archetype {{that is associated with}} Cofresí was predominant during the 19th century, being promoted by the romanticism present in the work of several prominent authors. Further influenced by an anti-establishment sentiment that arose from the dire conditions of the general population, the poor people quickly identified with these [...] "rebels", [...] "who were simply trying to make justice in an unfair social structure where the poor would always take the worst part". Shortly after his death, the popular songs that described his life painted his actions in a positive light, as [...] "feats" [...] instead of crimes. Another copla testifies how the general public praises his bravery, while labeling the authorities as cowards. However, the merchant class also had its own oral tradition, which portrayed him as a [...] "tyrant" [...] of the seas and celebrates that with him gone the business would be normalized. An example from Guayama claims that the pirates would bait the crews of passing vessels by disembarking at Cayo Caribe and posing as shipwrecked sailors, murdering them after the ships ran aground in the shallows. The Spanish government tried to create a parallel reputation, perpetuating Cofresí as a vile murder and thief. The American government fueled this, describing him as a [...] "famous piratical chief" [...] that ran a [...] "bloodthirsty" [...] leadership. Axe in hand, Cofresí, followed by his crew, jumped with agility and quickly onto the boarded ship and attacked body by body the defenders of the brick. They were not prepared for an attack with a cold weapon. With the sound of three or four shots the <b>tweendeck</b> was clear. The sailors of the brigantine took refuge in the hold. Cofresí quickly seized the ship bringing death to the helmsman and a few sailors that remained on deck. Afterwards they closed the hatches trapping the rest of the brick's crew below deck. The Danish captain was besides the sail's pole, in a pool of blood, his head opened by an axe... El pirata Cofresí by Cayetano Coll y Toste. In modern oral tradition, the fact that no other pirate, regardless of nationality, has been said to recurrently share his loot with the poor is emphasized. With time, popular culture has come to grant Cofresí the quality of chivalry, describing him as a gentleman, especially with women. For example, the tradition at Aguada claims that Cofresí would share his loot and throw banquets in the municipality to gain the public's favor. According to these, due to this tendency a peak used as a lookout to oversee the Aguada Bay, Pico Atalaya, {{played a key role in}} the capture of the pirates. This contrast is further noted when rival pirates are portrayed as ruthless cutthroats, that only want to invade his territory. In reality, little is known about the interactions between Cofresí and other pirate groups, but a folktale claims that when another captain named Hermenegildo [...] "El Tuerto" [...] López attempted to plunder the Ana, he defeated them and adopted the survivors into his own crew. Another local story claims that Cofresí's career began forcefully, when he was shanghai'd into a crew after killing their captain. Cofresí is further dignified with accounts that place him freeing captive slaves during a time where slavery was both accepted and widespread. Besides the widespread notion that he was generous, folklore has also claimed that he would protect the weak, in particular children. Ibern Fleytas claims that Cofresí was also protective of his daughter, once confiscating a set of emerald earrings that another crew-member had given to her. He is also portrayed a fervent protector of women and guardian of their well being. Ultimately, the depiction of Cofresí fits within the same swashbuckler archetype seen in modern media, but precedes the genre's popularization in film by several years. The use of an ax or hatchet is seen frequently in oral tradition, to the point that the weapon is even named [...] "Arturo" [...] and described as an [...] "inseparable friend". The axe is actually associated with Cabo Rojo, due to a territory dispute where its residents defended their land with said tool, and has since become the symbolic representation of its inhabitants. Its inclusion in the myths is likely meant to reflect the municipality's cultural identity. His physical appearance has been largely able to escape the modern stereotype of the pirates in popular culture, being rarely described with clichéd elements like an eye patch, large hat or a wooden leg.|$|E
