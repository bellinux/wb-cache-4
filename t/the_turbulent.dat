5|$|During production, Hergé kept {{abreast of}} <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> {{political}} developments in Tibet. In March 1959, Tibet's foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when Tintin in Tibet {{was published in}} China, state authorities renamed it Tintin in Chinese Tibet. When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book's original title.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{a survey of the}} {{relation}} between Forbush decreases, magnetic clouds, and interplanetary shocks during the period August 1978 to November 1982. We have used data from the ISEE- 3 study of bidirectional ions associated with magnetic structures or clouds of Marsden et al. (1987), and ground-based observations of Forbush decreases from several neutron monitors. We use the two-step model of a Forbush decrease. We assume that the first step is due to the passage of <b>the</b> postshock <b>turbulent</b> region, and that the second is due to the passage of the magnetic cloud or structure which usually follows <b>the</b> postshock <b>turbulent</b> region. To determine the effectiveness of <b>the</b> postshock <b>turbulent</b> region in causing a Forbush decrease, we have evaluated the radial diffusion coefficient of <b>the</b> postshock <b>turbulent</b> region for <b>the</b> eight largest events during the above period using observations of the magnetic field. We have made a quantitative assessment of the relative importance of <b>the</b> postshock <b>turbulent</b> region in <b>the</b> formation of the Forbush decrease, concluding that <b>the</b> postshock <b>turbulent</b> region alone is not sufficient to cause a Forbush decrease...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> layer.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of this rebellion, the Illyrians went on, {{alongside}} their neighbours the Thracians, to become {{the backbone of the}} Roman army. By the 2nd century, with roughly half the Roman army deployed on the Danube frontier, the auxilia and legions alike were dominated by Illyrian recruits. In the 3rd century, Illyrians largely replaced Italians in the senior officer echelons of praefecti of auxiliary regiments and tribuni militum of legions. Finally, from AD 268 to 379, virtually all emperors, including Diocletian and Constantine the Great were Romanised Illyrians from the provinces of Dalmatia, Moesia Superior and Pannonia. These were members of a military aristocracy, outstanding soldiers who saved the empire from collapse in <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> late 3rd century.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> political, {{social and}} musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified.

During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E

Barbara must learn to navigate courtly intrigues and financial crises while experiencing personal tragedies.|$|E
5|$|On release, The Beatles {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} the majority of music critics, but other commentators found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> political and social climate of 1968.

5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
5|$|By 1984, Nicky {{is working}} as a {{successful}} photographer, and Mary has divorced Tosker, who has remarried and is rapidly becoming a rich businessman. Nicky and Mary renew their earlier relationship during <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> events of the miners' strike and eventually marry. By 1987, however, their marriage is falling apart. Nicky has {{an affair with a}} young student and is also forced to confront his father's Alzheimer's disease. He meets Geordie, now a homeless, drunken vagrant, by chance in London, but his old friend disappears before {{he has a chance to}} help him. Eventually Geordie is sentenced to life in prison as a danger to the public after setting fire to a mattress in a hostel. Despite her failing marriage to Nicky, Mary's life is becoming an increasing success, and she is now a councillor. Tosker, meanwhile, has lost his fortune in the stock market crash.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> {{era of the}} Civil Wars and the {{incorporation}} of Scotland into a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions {{in the style of}} the trace italienne were built to house English soldiers at Ayr, Perth and Leith, and 20 smaller forts were built as far apart as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. The universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. After the Restoration in 1660, large-scale building began again, influenced by a growing interest in Classicism.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>turbulent</b> {{reign of}} Wang Mang, Han lost {{control over the}} Tarim Basin, which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD 63 and used as a base to invade Han's Hexi Corridor in Gansu. Dou Gu (d.88 AD) {{defeated}} the Northern Xiongnu at the Battle of Yiwulu in AD 73, evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake Barkol before establishing a garrison at Hami. After the new Protector General of the Western Regions Chen Mu (d.AD 75) was killed by allies of the Xiongnu in Karasahr and Kucha, the garrison at Hami was withdrawn. At the Battle of Ikh Bayan in AD 89, Dou Xian (d.AD 92) defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the Altai Mountains. After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD 91, the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from {{the borders of the}} Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people. The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai (檀石槐) (d.AD 180), who consistently defeated Chinese armies. However, Tanshihuai's confederation disintegrated after his death.|$|E

The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E
