5|$|The Rev. Edward Barlow invented <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> and snail {{striking}} mechanism for striking clocks, {{which was a}} great improvement over the previous mechanism. The repeating clock, that chimes {{the number of hours}} (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> and pinion steering had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E

5|$|Later, in the Central Asian campaign, {{a second}} plot against {{his life was}} revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those places where <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> is laid.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> mid 1900s, <b>Racking</b> Horse enthusiasts formed {{their own}} group, <b>the</b> <b>Racking</b> Horse Breeders Association of America, and their breed was {{recognized}} by the United States Department of Agriculture as separate from the Tennessee Walking Horse in 1971. In 1975, <b>the</b> <b>Racking</b> Horse was designated the official state horse of Alabama.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of data centers is numerically studied for different configurations of computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units and physical separations of cold and hot aisles.

25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rail. On sidings {{and around the}} yard at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, but on the running line, and through all the loops up the mountain, two rack bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their teeth staggered by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the pinions running along <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> The joints between rack bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rail as well as the running rails.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rack</b> or racking is {{a lateral}} gait most {{commonly}} associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> the speed is increased to be approximately that of the pace, {{but it is a}} four-beat gait with equal intervals between each beat.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} during the inquiry that the locomotive on a ballast train had lost <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> in January 1895 {{a little lower}} down the line.

40|$|Small-scale racking testers were {{developed}} {{for use as}} a means to evaluate paperboard-based sheathing materials used in framed wall-construction. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of different sheathing materials, the tester provides an economic alternative to standard full-scale racking tests. In addition, results from testing provide practical insight into <b>the</b> <b>racking</b> response of framed and sheathed walls. The load-deformation responses of three commercial sheathing boards were measured, and initial racking stiffness and racking strength were proposed as parameters for characterizing <b>the</b> board. <b>The</b> <b>racking</b> test results showed that <b>the</b> initial paperboard <b>racking</b> stiffness correlated to elastic modulus and caliper, but the response was insensitive to paperboard orientation or test dimensions. Observations and results showed that both panel buckling and paperboard cutting at the staples affected <b>the</b> <b>racking</b> response, but <b>the</b> dominating factor influencing <b>the</b> <b>racking</b> response appears to be load transfer through the staples...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rack</b> or racking is a gait that is {{also known}} as the singlefoot or single-foot. It is an even, lateral four-beat gait. Although many breeds of horses are capable of {{producing}} this gait, it is most commonly associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> the speed of an even lateral slow gait is increased, while keeping the even intervals between each beat. In the American Saddlebred show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained, while the slow gait is expected be performed with restraint and precision. <b>The</b> <b>rack</b> is also closely associated with the Racking Horse breed.|$|E

25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to <b>the</b> <b>rack.</b> On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rack</b> rail design used {{is one of}} Marsh's own inventions, using a ladder-like rack {{with open}} bar rungs engaged by {{the teeth of the}} cog wheel. This system allows snow and debris to fall through <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> rather than lodging in it. A similar design called the Riggenbach rack system was invented by {{engineer}} Niklaus Riggenbach in Switzerland at about the same time. The Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh while constructing the railway up Mount Washington, and his enthusiastic reports persuaded the Swiss government to commission Riggenbach to build the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Rigi Mountain, which opened on May 21, 1871.|$|E
