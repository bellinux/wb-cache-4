This study describes national CDI incidence by age group over a 10 -year period and mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with CDI. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of the U. S. National Hospital Discharge Surveys from 2001 to 2010. Eligible patients with an ICD- 9 -CM discharge diagnosis code for CDI (008. 45) were stratified by age: < 18  years (pediatrics), 18 – 64 years (adults), and [*]≥ 65  years (elderly adults). Data weights were used to derive national estimates. CDI incidence was calculated as CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges.</b> Mortality and LOS were compared between age groups using chi-square or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results These data represent 2. 3 million hospital discharges for CDI over the study period. CDI incidence was highest among elderly adults (11. 6 CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges),</b> followed by adults (3. 5 CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges)</b> and pediatrics (1. 2 CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges).</b> The elderly also had higher rates of mortality (8. 8 %) compared to adults (3. 1 %) and pediatrics (1. 4 %) (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001).

A detailed isopleth mass distribution map was prepared covering as far as 85  km from the source. The main ash-fall dispersal was ENE in the proximal and medial areas and E in the distal area. The secondary distribution lobes also extended to the S and NW proximally, reflecting the effects of elutriation ash and surge deposits from pyroclastic density currents during the phreatic eruption. The <b>total</b> <b>discharged</b> mass of the 1979 phreatic eruption was also calculated for comparison.
