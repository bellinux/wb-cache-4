40|$|The {{invention}} {{refers to}} the fields of ceramics and powder metallurgy and relates to a process which could be applied as an adjustment device in firing systems. The invention {{is based on the}} technical problem of producing by shaping a flexible component consisting of several individual components finished in geometry and configuration and avoiding further process steps. In the process, a single component is shaped by homogenizing a sinterable ceramic or metallurgical powder using a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>binding</b> agent above the softening point and below the decomposition or evaporation temperature of said binding agent and then inserting it into a tool. Then the tool is cooled to a temperature below the softening temperature of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>binding</b> agent and the tool is then removed. Said individual element was shaped in an already existing individual component or a further individual component is shaped in the individual component produced according to the invention. After completion of th e entire component, the component is sintered after the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>binding</b> agent has completely cured...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate microwave and electron beam technologies as alternate energy sources to consolidate fiber coated with a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>binding</b> agent into preforms for composite molding applications. Bench experiments showed that both microwave and electron beam energy can produce heat sufficient to melt and consolidate a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>binding</b> agent applied to fiberglass mat, and several two- and three-dimensional fiberglass preforms were produced with each method. In both cases, it is postulated that the heating was accomplished by the effective interaction of the microwave or electron beam energy with the combination of the mat preform and the tooling used to shape the preform. Both methods contrast with conventional thermal energy applied via infrared heaters or from a heated tool in which the heat to melt the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>binding</b> agent must diffuse over time from the outer surface of the preform toward its center under a thermal gradient. For these reasons, the microwave and electron beam energy techniques have the potential to rapidly consolidate thick fiber preforms more efficiently than the thermal process. With further development, both technologies have the potential to make preform production more cost effective by decreasing cycle time in the preform tool, reducing energy costs, and by enabling the use of less expensive tooling materials. Descriptions of the microwave and electron beam consolidation experiments and a summary of the results are presented in this report...|$|E

The grain size and distribution and/or compactness of the grains in green foil are such that it is suitable for sintering. USE - For a machining tool. ADVANTAGE - Simpler, more suitable for mass production lines...|$|E
5000|$|... "Sulfur [...] "concrete" [...] is an {{established}} construction material. Strictly speaking it isn't a concrete {{as there is}} little by way of chemical reaction. Instead the sulfur acts as a <b>thermoplastic</b> material <b>binding</b> with a non reactive substrate. Cement and water are not required. The concrete doesn't have to be cured, instead it is simply heated to above the melting point of sulfur, 140 Â°C, and after cooling it reaches high strength immediately.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the laser cutting of carbon fiber {{reinforced}} thermo-plastic (CFRTP) with a cw IR fiber laser (average power: 1 kW). CFRTP is a composite material which contains carbon fibers and <b>binding</b> <b>thermoplastic.</b> A well-defined cutting of CFRTP which was free of debris around the groove was performed by the laser irradiation with a fast beam galvanometer scanning on a multiple-scan-pass method. The area of laser-induced damages in the samples was observed by microscopic X-ray Computed Tomography and micro- Raman spectroscopy. Laser cutting with a high speed beam scanning exhibits a clean top and an excellent sidewall quality along with a negligible heat affected zone...|$|R
