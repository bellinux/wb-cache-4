2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman strut suspension, and the <b>tie-rod</b> related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} are the metallic <b>tie-rods,</b> being relevant structural elements in historic masonry buildings. They actually contribute to guarantee an efficient connection between walls playing a decisive role in the control of horizontal thrusts (both permanent, {{as in the case}} of arches and vaults, or environmental, {{as in the case of}} seismic actions). The idea of focusing the research on <b>tie-rods</b> derives from the evidence that, despite their role, scarce studies have been conducted on these structural elements. This results in a lack of knowledge on their technological features, in a scarcity of data on their mechanical properties and, finally, in many unaware replacement interventions. For these reasons, the research aims at: defining a simple non-destructive or micro-invasive assessment procedure of <b>tie-rods,</b> providing a more rational evaluation of their macroscopic parameters as well as their damage and degradation processes. The project will lead to: an improvement of the structural models of heritage buildings, resulting in more reliable seismic analyses and, indeed, in optimized strengthening interventions; a reduction of the number of replacements, resulting in a higher conservation of tangible assets (the <b>tie-rods)</b> and intangible values (e. g. ancient techniques of productions, local identity) ...|$|R

In this paper, a device prototype based on the superelastic properties of Cu-based Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs), is proposed to enhance the thermal behavior of such structural elements. The thermal behavior of steel <b>tie-rods</b> with and without SMA is evaluated through comprehensive experimental tests in thermal room. During the tests, different temperature-time histories are considered, with air temperature varied between - 10 °C and 40 °C. The results of the experimental tests confirm the great effectiveness of the proposed SMA device, with reductions of force changes due to air temperature variations {{of the order of}} 80 - 90 %, compared to steel <b>tie-rods</b> without SMAs. In the paper, the main structural components and basic functioning principles of a SMA-based device prototype for masonry arches and vaults are presented and aspects related to its implementation in practice are discussed in detail...|$|R

However, few studies have conducted on the mechanical behaviour of metallic <b>tie-rods</b> in the last years and most of them are devoted to the identification of the axial stress. This results in rather unreliable models of these reinforcing elements, based on simplified constitutive laws (usually disregarding deformability issues, that play a fundamental role in modern seismic engineering) and on conventional material properties (usually extrapolated from those of modern ferrous alloys, or from some literature tests on XIX century steel bridges). At a bigger scale, this results in rather unreliable models of heritage buildings, leading to unreliable safety assessment procedures and unaware consolidation interventions (mostly replacements). The paper present the first results of an on-going study on the mechanical characterization of ancient iron <b>tie-rods,</b> based on experimental tests performed on a set of real <b>tie-rods</b> recovered from restoration works or building demolitions. Dealing with a structural ferrous material produced by bloomery smelting (an ironmaking process used in ancient items in Europe) and therefore potentially rich in inclusions and poor in alloying elements, tests of both metallographic and mechanical nature are introduced...|$|R

50|$|It {{was based}} on the same {{platform}} chassis as the Citroën 2CV, sharing its advanced independent front to rear interconnected suspension. This comprised a central springing unit, running fore-and-aft in a tube on each side; each suspension arm on that side was linked to the spring, by a <b>tie-rod</b> and a 'knife-edge' pivot-pin. Early cars did not have conventional shock absorbers. See Citroën 2CV for detailed information. The squeak heard from most 2CVs and Dyanes as they go over bumps is due to lack of lubrication either inside the spring tubes or to the 'knife-edges'. The front hubs kingpins need to be greased every 600 miles. Since this is often overlooked, the king-pins can be prone to wear, although some movement is acceptable.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{behaviour}} of a hingeless helicopter blade {{with a novel}} integra-ted smart morphing actuator is studied. The proposed {{smart device}} is aimed at the reduction of BVI noise through transformation of the blade tip shape into an anhedral tip type {{and is based on}} the concept of a variable-stiffness blade. In detail, the blade morphing is obtained through joint action of a magneto-rheological-fluid (MRF) device, shape-memory alloy (SMA) <b>tie-rods</b> and a set of concentrated masses properly distributed spanwise. In this architecture, the MRF system has to provide local bending-stiffness reduction and concentrated masses have to provide inertial moments whereas the SMA <b>tie-rods</b> have to mo-uld the blade tip shape. Since the equilibrium configuration of the smart blade deeply depends on the interaction between the aeroelastic response and the actuation loads, in this work a numerical investigation examines potentiality and shortcomings of the proposed integrated smart system to morph a realistic blade with respect to the baseline configuration.

5000|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.On the church's northeastern elevation there are three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash.

Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five <b>tie-rod</b> masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation.

50|$|The plantar fascia {{contributes}} to support of arch {{of the foot}} by acting as a <b>tie-rod,</b> where it undergoes tension when the foot bears weight. One biomechanical model estimated it carries as much as 14% of the total load of the foot. In an experiment using cadavers, it was found that failure of the plantar fascia averaged at loads of 1189 ± 244 newtons (121 ± 24 kgf or 267 ± 55 lbf). Interestingly, failure most often occurred at the proximal attachment to the calcaneus, which is consistent with the usual location of symptoms (i.e. in plantar fasciitis). Complete rupture or surgical release of the plantar fascia leads to a decrease in arch stiffness and a significant collapse of the longitudinal {{arch of the foot}}. By modeling it was predicted such conditions would result in a 17% increase in vertical displacement and a 15% increase in horizontal elongation of the foot when it was loaded at 683 N. Surgical release also significantly increases both stress in the plantar ligaments and plantar pressures under the metatarsal heads. Although most of the figures mentioned above are from either cadaver studies or investigations using models, they highlight the relatively large load the plantar fascia is subjected to while contributing to the structural integrity of the foot.|$|E
