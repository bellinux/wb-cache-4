Zhuge Liang gains Jiang Wei {{as a general}} after {{isolating}} him and tricking Wei general Ma Zun into thinking that he was betraying him, in a clever ploy at the Battle of Tianshui ("Tales"). He proceeds to defeat the Wei after a failed prisoner exchange at the Battle of Mt. Dingjun and saves Ma Su from defeat at the Battle of Jieting. His final battle with Wei is at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, where he fakes his death, only to ambush the Wei forces and defeat Sima Yi. If Wu has fallen before Wei, Shu will attack Xuchang, the co-capital of Wei, and <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> Wei's officers fighting to the death.|$|E

You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E

After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E

25|$|A {{long list}} of actors were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Potter (originally named Herbert Potter): Edward Arnold, Charles Bickford, Edgar Buchanan, Louis Calhern, Victor Jory, Raymond Massey, Vincent Price and even Thomas Mitchell. However, Lionel Barrymore, who eventually won the role, was a famous Ebenezer Scrooge in radio dramatizations of A Christmas Carol at the time and was a natural choice for the role. Barrymore had also worked with Capra on his 1938 Best Picture Oscar winner, You Can't <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>with</b> You.|$|E

Also on Gower Street was a drugstore that was a favorite for the studio's employees.|$|E
25|$|Through his law office, Wright {{became a}} friend of state {{representative}} William Perkins Bryant. In 1832, Bryant moved to Kentucky, leaving his seat vacant, and urged Wright to <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> his support, Wright was elected and served as Park County's representative to the Indiana House of Representatives, serving a one-year term. During the term he supported the charter for the Bank of Indiana, an unpopular act in his district, and he was defeated in his reelection bid. In 1836, supporting internal improvements, he ran again and was elected to serve a second term; {{it was during the}} height of the state's internal improvement craze and he voted for the implementing act.|$|E

At this moment one of the humans - Maya Glumova turns on an emergency flashlight that is built into the transmitter. The transmission immediately stops. It is disputed if Maya did it on purpose. However, Komov takes the responsibility for the failure of the mission on himself.|$|E

Having had four courses of chemotherapy, she developed chronic heart disease. Having been elevated to a CBE in June 2007, Jane Tomlinson died in St Gemma's Hospice, Leeds, West Yorkshire less than three months later on 3 September.

Later that day she was cremated in a private family ceremony. On 15 November 2007 Tomlinson's ten-year-old son, Steven, collected her CBE from Charles, Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
25|$|The {{package was}} aimed at {{attracting}} viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone, 7:00p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived {{as a result of}} the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can't <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>With</b> You were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Out of This World ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Marriott had several guest {{performances}} on television shows including The Defenders, Route 66, and The Patty Duke Show. In 1963 he {{was cast in}} a primary role in Robert Thom's Bicycle Ride to Nevada, which opened the season at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in September, prior to premiering on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on September 24. The play was not well received by the critics, and closed after a single performance. His next project was {{a prominent role in}} The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, which opened on November 11, 1963 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, after a week of previews. While this Broadway premiere was not a commercial success, the Bertolt Brecht play is considered a classical theater satire. Marriott's film contribution in 1963 fared better, as he played the role of Hurst in the critically acclaimed, The Cool World. During the decade he would continue to perform in regional theater, such as You Can't <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>with</b> You in 1966 at the Corning Summer Theatre. The following year he appeared in Eugene O'Neill's More Stately Mansions, which opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on Halloween (October 31) 1967, and ran for 142 performances. The play starred Ingrid Bergman, Colleen Dewhurst, and Arthur Hill. After Mansions closed on March 2, 1968, Marriott appeared in the very next production at the Broadhurst, as Roger in the Gore Vidal political comedy, Weekend, which opened on March 13. The play was not well received and closed after only 21 performances.|$|E
