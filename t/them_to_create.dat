5|$|Rura Penthe {{was created}} {{with a mixture}} of on-set and {{location}} shots, along with an establishing sequence created by Matte World. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a lightning storm underway in the background.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} a steering committee and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees. Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a new language.|$|E
5|$|Lansdale {{employed}} {{a variety of}} stunts to encourage more northerners to move south. South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north, spreading rumours of impending doom. One story was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam's traditional enemy China, allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north. The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the tacit approval of the communists. Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a list of their material possessions so that the communists {{would be able to}} confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.|$|E

5|$|These {{changes were}} {{embodied}} in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments. It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a new Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, {{and a large number}} of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the Special Reserve, which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime.|$|E
5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E
5|$|Din's attendant, Impa, tells Link {{that they}} were headed for Hyrule; she instructs {{him to see the}} Maku Tree in Horon Village, the capital of Holodrum. Link finds a sword in a cave and makes his way to the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link {{retrieves}} the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E

5000|$|... "Banking was {{conceived}} in iniquity and {{was born in}} sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave <b>them</b> the power <b>to</b> <b>create</b> money, and with the flick of the pen they will <b>create</b> enough deposits <b>to</b> buy it back again. However, take away from <b>them</b> the power <b>to</b> <b>create</b> money and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear {{and they ought to}} disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let <b>them</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>create</b> money."

5|$|The 1066 Norman conquest {{brought a}} new set of Norman and French churchmen to power; some adopted and embraced aspects of the former Anglo-Saxon {{religious}} system, while others introduced practices from Normandy. Extensive English lands were granted to monasteries in Normandy, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> daughter priories and monastic cells across the kingdom. The monasteries were brought firmly into the web of feudal relations, with their holding of land linked to the provision of military support to the crown. The Normans adopted the Anglo-Saxon model of monastic cathedral communities, and within seventy years the majority of English cathedrals were controlled by monks; every English cathedral, however, was rebuilt to some extent by the new rulers. England's bishops remained powerful temporal figures, and in the early 12th-century raised armies against Scottish invaders and built up extensive holdings of castles across the country.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director {{and the director of}} the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E

The output of the innovation strategy is applied to the plastic and aesthetic surgery clinic. The theoretical part deals with the introduction of strategic management theory, vast business analysis and principles of Balanced Scorecard. Within the theory are discussed different approaches to the innovation process. The practical part is based on theoretical knowledge and applies <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> an innovation strategy based on business process management...|$|R

5|$|Link {{receives}} a sword from Impa {{and makes his}} way to the Maku Tree in Lynna City, the capital of Labrynna. The Maku Tree is killed in the past on Veran's orders; Link uses a time portal to travel to the past to prevent this. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Time to defeat Veran. Link sets out to retrieve the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Labrynna's past and present. After getting the sixth Essence, Link is told he has the opportunity to save Nayru. He invades Queen Ambi's castle and removes Veran's spirit from Nayru, but Veran then possesses Queen Ambi. Link gathers the remaining Essences and brings them to the Maku Tree, who uses <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a Huge Maku Seed that allows Link to enter Veran's Black Tower. Link ascends the tower and defeats Veran. He rescues Queen Ambi, and Nayru tells him that all has returned to normal. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that Veran has lit the Flame of Sorrow.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} on Sonic the Hedgehog in 2004, {{after the completion}} of Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The team was considering working on an original non-Sonic project, with a realistic look and feel and an advanced physics engine. When they were reassigned to work on the new Sonic game, they decided to retain the realistic approach for the new game. Series co-creator and team lead Yuji Naka envisioned the next-generation Sonic game as a reboot of the franchise, and wanted to mimic the success of superhero films such as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman Begins (2005). It was decided to use the same title as the original 1991 game that had launched the franchise to indicate {{that it would be a}} major advance from the previous games. The Havok physics engine, previously used in their PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy (2004), allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles, and experiment with multiple play-styles. Game director Shun Nakamura demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
5|$|Tess, {{awakening}} {{on a table}} {{inside a}} laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), who reveals that Lex took his imperfect clones' best pieces and assembled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a perfect clone of himself. Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the Luthor Mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes {{for not being able}} to save Lex, but declares that he will always be there to stop him in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always knew that she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As she lays dying, she infects Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.|$|E
