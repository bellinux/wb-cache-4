25|$|The {{alternative}} CP-67 {{system for}} the S/360-67 started a whole line of IBM operating systems focused {{on the concept of}} virtual machines. Other operating systems used on IBM S/360 series mainframes included systems developed by IBM: COS/360 (Compatibility Operating System), DOS/360 (Disk Operating System), TSS/360 (Time Sharing System), TOS/360 (Tape Operating System), BOS/360 (Basic Operating System), and ACP (Airline Control Program), as well as a few non-IBM systems: MTS (Michigan <b>Terminal</b> <b>System),</b> MUSIC (Multi-User System for Interactive Computing), and ORVYL (Stanford Timesharing System).|$|E

25|$|The next {{area to be}} {{electrified}} was the Philadelphia terminal area, where PRR officials {{decided to}} use overhead lines to supply power to the suburban trains running out of Broad Street Station. Unlike the New York <b>terminal</b> <b>system,</b> overhead wires would carry 11,000-volt 25-Hertz alternating current (AC) power: the system used for all future installations. In 1915, electrification of the line from Philadelphia to Paoli, Pennsylvania was completed. Other Philadelphia lines electrified were the Chestnut Hill Branch (1918), White Marsh (1924), West Chester (1928), the main line to Wilmington, Delaware, and in 1930 the Schuylkill Branch to Norristown, {{along with the rest}} of the main line to Trenton.|$|E
