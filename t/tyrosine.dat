5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from <b>tyrosine,</b> a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase converts <b>tyrosine</b> to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of <b>tyrosine</b> hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on <b>tyrosine</b> residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated <b>tyrosine</b> kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein <b>tyrosine</b> phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein <b>tyrosine</b> phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E

40|$|Janus kinases {{are the key}} enzymes {{involved}} in the initial transmission of signals in response to type I and II cytokines. Activation of the signal begins with the transphosphorylation of Jak kinases. Substrates {{that give rise to}} downstream events are recruited to the receptor complex in part by interactions with phosphorylated <b>tyrosines.</b> The identity of many of the phosphotyrosines responsible for recruitment has been elucidated as being receptor-based <b>tyrosines.</b> The ability of Jaks to recruit substrates through their own phosphotyrosines has been demonstrated for <b>tyrosines</b> in the kinase activation loop. Recent studies demonstrate that other <b>tyrosines</b> have implications in regulatory roles of Jak kinase activity. In this study, baculovirus-produced Jak 2 was utilized to demonstrate that transphosphorylation of Jak kinases occurs on multiple residues throughout the protein. We demonstrate that among the <b>tyrosines</b> phosphorylated, those in the kinase domain occur as expected, but many other sites are also phosphorylated. The <b>tyrosines</b> conserved in the Jak family are the object of this study, although many of them are phosphorylated, many are not. This result suggests that conservation of <b>tyrosines</b> is perhaps as important in maintaining structure of the Jak family. Additionally, non-Jak family conserved <b>tyrosines</b> are phosphorylated suggesting that the individual Jaks ability to phosphorylated specific <b>tyrosines</b> may influence signals emitting from activated Jaks...|$|R

In a mouse breast cancer model, tensin- 3 <b>tyrosines</b> are phosphorylated in a Src-associated manner in primary tumors, and experimental metastases induced by tumor-derived cell lines depend on endogenous tensin- 3.

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid <b>tyrosine.</b> Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules.

However, {{the effects of these}} mutations on the binding affinities and forward rates have not been studied. We quantified these effects by using an adhesion frequency assay to measure two-dimensional affinity and kinetic rates at zero force. Wild-type PSGL- 1 has 2. 2 - to 8. 5 -fold higher binding affinities for P- and L-selectin than PSGL- 1 mutants with two of three <b>tyrosines</b> substituted by phenylalanines, and 9. 6 - to 49 -fold higher affinities than the PSGL- 1 mutant with all three <b>tyrosines</b> replaced.
