5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> waters above.

5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E

25|$|Coastal fish, {{also called}} inshore fish or neritic fish, inhabit the sea between the {{shoreline}} and {{the edge of}} the continental shelf.

Coastal fish can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which inhabit the deep seas beyond the continental shelves.|$|E

25|$|Epipelagic fish {{inhabit the}} epipelagic zone. The epipelagic zone is {{the water from}} the surface of the sea down to 200 metres. It is also {{referred}} to as the surface waters or <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> zone, and includes the photic zone. The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1% of the surface value. This depth depends on how turbid the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with the epipelagic zone. The photic zone has sufficient light for phytoplankton to photosynthese.|$|E

25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that will hit <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time {{very low frequency}} (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of physical changes {{is still not}} clear. Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere. The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds. Other changes in the southern polar region {{can be explained by}} changes in the lower cloud layers. The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by a changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.|$|E
25|$|Ethane, {{acetylene}} and diacetylene condense in the colder {{lower part}} of stratosphere forming haze layers with an optical depth of about 0.01 in visible light. Condensation occurs at approximately 14, 2.5 and 0.1mbar for ethane, acetylene and diacetylene, respectively. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets—the upper atmosphere of Uranus is very clean and transparent above the haze layers. This depletion is caused by weak vertical mixing, and makes Uranus's stratosphere less opaque and, as a result, colder than those of other giant planets. The hazes, like their parent hydrocarbons, are distributed unevenly across Uranus; at the solstice of 1986, when Voyager 2 passed by the planet, they were concentrated near <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> pole, making it dark in ultraviolet light.|$|E

25|$|All manned {{landings}} {{happened during}} the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> landscape around {{them so that they}} could not see the relatively faint stars. Likewise, cameras were set for daylight exposure and could not detect the stars. Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were {{in the shadow of the}} Moon.|$|E
25|$|The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is {{the only}} extant member of the genus Notorynchus, in the family Hexanchidae. It is {{recognizable}} because of its seven gill slits, while most shark species have five gill slits, {{with the exception of}} the members of the order Hexanchiformes and the sixgill sawshark. This shark has a large, thick body, with a broad head and blunt snout. The top jaw has jagged, cusped teeth and the bottom jaw has comb-shaped teeth. Its single dorsal fin is set far back along the spine towards the caudal fin, and is behind the pelvic fins. In this shark the upper caudal fin is much longer than the lower, and is slightly notched near the tip. Like many sharks, this sevengill is counter-shaded. Its dorsal surface is silver-gray to brown in order to blend with the dark water and substrate when viewed from above. In counter to this, its ventral surface is very pale, blending with <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> water when viewed from below. The body and fins are covered in a scattering of small black & white spots. In juveniles, their fins often have white margins.|$|E

Astronomers now suspect that Eris's spin axis is currently pointing toward the Sun, which would make <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> hemisphere warmer than average and skew any infrared measurements toward higher values. So the outcome from the 2010 Chile occultation is actually more in line with the Hubble result from 2005.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, colour {{constancy}} in {{the visual}} system recalibrates {{the relations between the}} colours of an object and its surroundings, and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark, <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> Moon is perceived as a bright object. The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the centre, with no limb darkening, due to the reflective properties of lunar soil, which reflects more light back towards the Sun than in other directions. The Moon does appear larger when close to the horizon, but this is a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, first described in the 7th century BC. The full moon subtends an arc of about 0.52° (on average) in the sky, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see [...] ).|$|E

500|$|Early {{researchers}} including Alfred Russel Wallace, Beddard, Cott and Craik {{argued that}} in marine animals including pelagic fish such as marlin and mackerel, as well as dolphins, sharks, and penguins {{the upper and lower}} surfaces are sharply distinct in tone, with a dark upper surface and often a nearly white lower surface. They suggested that when seen from the top, the darker dorsal surface of the animal would offer camouflage against the darkness of the deep water below. When seen from below, the lighter ventral area would similarly provide the least possible contrast with <b>the</b> <b>sunlit</b> ocean surface above. There is some evidence for this in birds, where birds that catch fish at a medium depth, rather than at the surface or on the seabed, are more often coloured in this way, and the prey of these birds would see only the underside of the bird. Rowland concluded that each possible role for coloration patterns lumped together as [...] "countershading" [...] needs to be evaluated separately, rather than just assuming it functions effectively.|$|E
