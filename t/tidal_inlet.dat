5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of <b>Tidal</b> <b>Inlet</b> in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E
25|$|Barker Inlet is {{a shallow}} <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> which, with the {{adjacent}} Port River Estuary, formed during the Holocene by the progressive {{extension of the}} Lefevre Peninsula by northward littoral drift of sand carried by wave action along {{the eastern shore of}} Gulf St Vincent.|$|E

25|$|Wave swash and {{currents}} can impact significantly on {{the sediment}} budget, {{although it is}} difficult to measure. Swash can be either an erosive or accretion process depending on many factors such as the sand texture and the individual wave itself. Although during fair weather the impact of swash is negligible, during storms the sea level can rise high enough to erode dunes and cliffs, dumping large quantities of sediment into the littoral cell, which can only be given back to the dune by aeolian transport. Where storm surge causes sediments to be deposited on the land from the littoral cell, they can form washover fans or open a new <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> which transports sediment away from the littoral cell.|$|E
25|$|The Barker Inlet is a <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> of the Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide, South Australia, {{named after}} Captain Collet Barker who first sighted it in 1831. It {{contains}} {{one of the}} southernmost mangrove forests in the world, a dolphin sanctuary, seagrass meadows and is an important fish and shellfish breeding ground. The inlet separates Torrens Island and Garden Island from the mainland to the East and {{is characterized by a}} network of tidal creeks, artificially deepened channels, and wide mudflats. The extensive belt of mangroves are bordered by samphire saltmarsh flats and low-lying sand dunes, there are two boardwalks (at Garden Island and St Kilda), and ships graveyards in Broad Creek, Angas Inlet and the North Arm.|$|E
25|$|A new {{location}} became available in 1890. When terrible floods hit the District of Columbia in 1881, Congress enacted legislation {{to have the}} channel of the Potomac River deepened to help prevent future flooding. The silt {{would be used to}} reclaim the Tiber Creek <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet,</b> building up the land south of B Street and west of the Washington Monument grounds to a height great enough to act as a levee. This work was largely complete by 1890, and designated West Potomac Park by Congress in 1897. During this same period, Columbia Island formed as an offshoot of Analostan Island. The combination of reclaimed land and {{the emergence of a new}} island meant that it was now possible to build a bridge even further south than the previously proposed locations.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets</b> on longshore drift shores accumulate sediment in flood and ebb shoals. Ebb-deltas may become stunted on highly exposed shores and in smaller spaces, whereas flood deltas {{are likely to}} increase in size when space is available in a bay or lagoon system. <b>Tidal</b> <b>inlets</b> can act as sinks and sources for large amounts of material, which therefore impacts on adjacent parts of the coastline.|$|R

25|$|The final {{stretch of}} the river, called Friars Fleet, was used by steam tugs and barges {{delivering}} gas water from Cambridge Gas Works to the West Norfolk Farmers Manure Works until 1932. To {{the south of the}} factory, the tidal doors of the Old Nar Tidal Sluice prevented the tide passing further upstream. A wharf called Boal Quay was served by coasters, and fishing boats moored in the channel. With the removal of the Kings Lynn Harbour Branch railway line which crossed a large loop on this section, the river was diverted to a new sluice close to the Ouse, although two-thirds of the loop remains as a <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet.</b> To mitigate against flood risks, a flood diversion channel was constructed between the Nar and the Ouse Flood Relief Channel in 2001, at the point at which they are closest. A sluice was constructed in the flood bank, which is controlled by electric motors, and the new channel joins the Flood Relief Channel upstream from Saddlebow Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Somers {{is perhaps}} best known for its yacht club and sailing facilities. The waters {{offshore}} from Somers, neighbouring Balnarring and Merricks Beaches, Flinders and Shoreham, and the body of water between the Mornington Peninsula and Philip Island {{are some of the most}} ideal and safest regions for sailing of all types in Australia. On most days many sailboats, mainly catamarans, can be seen in the waters of Western Port Bay participating in several races that are held during good sailing conditions, usually on weekends. The <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> of Merricks Creek at low tide is one of the best places around Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula for skiffle boarding, while the South Beach (actually to the east of the main beach) is tucked away behind the belt of foreshore bushland that is Somers Foreshore Reserve, and is enjoyed mainly by local residents, while the main beach, Somers Beach, is home to one of the major yacht clubs in Western Port, Somers Yacht Club. Walking is also popular in Somers as good quality sealed and unsealed pathways exist along roadsides and in parklands, where walkers enjoy native bush land, wildlife and views of Western Port.|$|E
500|$|About 400Bankers {{inhabit the}} long, narrow barrier islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks. These islands are {{offshore}} sediment deposits {{separated from the}} mainland by {{a body of water}} such as an estuary or sound. The islands can be up to [...] from the shore; most are less than onemile (1.6km) wide. Vegetation is sparse and consists mainly of coarse grasses and a few stunted trees.

40|$|The North Adriatic coastal area, {{between the}} Isonzo and Po rivers, mainly {{consists}} of lagoon-river delta systems fronted by barrier islands and sandbars and fed by <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets</b> (Fontolan et al., 2007). Despite the microtidal regime (mean spring range 1. 1 m; mean neap range 0. 3 m), the limited wave influence tends to produce <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets</b> of the tide-dominated type (Hubbard et al., 1979). The <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets,</b> particularly when not fixed by jetties, {{have a very}} high sand trapping capabilities, {{as a consequence of the}} strong interference generated by tidal currents on the littoral drift. In this paper a review of the main environmental features are presented and discussed, with a particular focus on the morpho-sedimentary signatures useful for the interpretation of the analogues in the geological record, as follow: 1) Large scale sedimentary traps (tidal deltas) 2) Medium to small scale bedforms due to tidal currents 3) Grain-size patter...|$|R

500|$|As {{trade in}} Blyth {{continued}} to grow, {{so did the}} population. [...] Development of the Cowpen Quay and Waterloo areas began in about 1810 and 1815 respectively, and between the 1850s and 1890s major house building took place in these areas. [...] Blyth railway station, first built in 1847, was relocated in 1867 and rebuilt in 1896, {{to cope with the}} increase in goods and passenger traffic. [...] The 1890s saw the filling in of [...] "the Slake" [...] (also known as [...] "the Flanker" [...] or [...] "the Gut"). [...] The Slake was a <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> which stretched south from the river, across the site of today's bus station, along the route of Beaconsfield Street, and on past Crofton Mill Pit. [...] Before it was filled in, it almost entirely separated Blyth from Cowpen—Waterloo Bridge providing the only main link. [...] Once it was removed, the two areas could combine and allow the town to begin to take its present form. [...] The town continued to expand in the 20th century; much large-scale house building took place in the 1920s and 1930s, and from the 1950s to the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Bruges became {{important}} {{due to the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> {{that was}} important to local commerce, This inlet was then known as the [...] "Golden Inlet". Bruges received its city charter on 27 July 1128, and new walls and canals were built. In 1089 Bruges became {{the capital of the}} County of Flanders. Since about 1050, gradual silting had caused the city to lose its direct access to the sea. A storm in 1134, however, re-established this access, through the creation of a natural channel at the Zwin. The new sea arm stretched all the way to Damme, a city that became the commercial outpost for Bruges.|$|E
2500|$|The Gowanus {{neighborhood}} originally surrounded Gowanus Creek, {{which consisted}} of a <b>tidal</b> <b>inlet</b> of navigable creeks in original saltwater marshland and meadows that contained wildlife. Henry Hudson and Giovanni da Verrazzano both navigated the inlet in their explorations of New York Harbor. The first land patents within Breukelen (Brooklyn), including {{the land of the}} Gowanus, were issued by the Dutch government from 1630 to 1664. [...] In 1636, the leaders of New Netherland bought the area around the Gowanus Bay, and in 1639, the inhabitants swapped land claims with each other in order to build a tobacco plantation. The early settlers of the area named the waterway [...] "Gowanes Creek" [...] after Gouwane, sachem of the local Lenape tribe called the Canarsee, who farmed on the shores.|$|E

40|$|In {{the dune}} {{area of the}} Westhoek Nature Reserve, {{situated}} in the western Belgian coastal plain, two artificial <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets</b> were made aiming to enhance biodiversity. The infiltration of salt water in these <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets</b> was carefully monitored because a fresh water lens {{is present in the}} phreatic dune aquifer. This forms an important source of fresh water which is for instance exploited by a water company. The infiltration was monitored over a period of two years by means of electromagnetic borehole measurements (EM 39) and by measurements of fresh water heads and temperature using a large number of observation wells. EM 39 observations point to aquifer heterogeneity as a determining factor in the movement of the salt infiltration water. It is shown that part of the infiltration water moves further in the dunes instead of towards the sea. On the long term run, possibility exists that salt water enters the extraction’s capture zone. This issue needs further monitoring and study. Fresh water head and temperature data illustrate that the main period of infiltration is confined to spring tide when large amounts of salt water enter the <b>tidal</b> <b>inlets...</b>|$|R
