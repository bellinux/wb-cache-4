For the particular data set used in this study, SAS yielded inconclusive results. The results obtained using ArcGIS confirm previous findings suggesting low birthweight clusters located in Spartanburg, Chesnee, and possibly Inman and Greer.

40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} an improved {{implementation of a}} method pointed out for the static characterization of {{the new generation of}} high resolution Digital to Analogue Converters (DACs). Interesting aspect of this method is that the problem of the signal acquisition with high resolution is shifted to the simpler problem of the signal acquisition with high speed. In particular, the method is based on the comparison of <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> output voltage with the analogue reference sinusoidal voltage and the detection of the Zero Crossing Sequence (ZCS) of the resulting signal by high speed ADC. The variation of the ZCS respect to that occurring in the sinusoidal reference signal is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> transfer characteristic. <b>The</b> improved implementation concerns the proper design characteristics that can be used as selecting criteria of the test equipment. In particular, the substitution of the ADC for the detection of the ZCS by the comparator device is investigated without affecting the accurate detection of the zero crossing. Moreover, the effects of the noise parameters affecting the generator feeding the reference analogue signal, as amplitude and phase noise, on the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> static characteristic is analysed by considering test equipment <b>using</b> <b>the</b> comparator device and the high speed ADC, alternatively...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high-speed}} communication systems has dramatically increased {{during the last}} decades. Working as an interface between the digital and analog world, Digital-to-Analog converters (DACs) {{are becoming more and}} more important because they are a key part which limits the accuracy and speed of an overall system. Consequently, the requirements for high-speed and high-accuracy DACs are increasingly demanding. It is well recognized that dynamic performance of <b>the</b> <b>DACs</b> degrades dramatically with increasing input signal frequencies and update rates. The dynamic performance is often characterized by the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). The SFDR is determined by the spectral harmonics, which are attributable to system nonlinearities.;A new calibration approach is presented in this thesis that compensates for the dynamic errors in performance. In this approach, the nonlinear components of the input dependent and previous input code dependent errors are characterized, and correction codes that can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> calibrate <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> for these nonlinearities are stored in a two-dimensional error look-up table. A series of pulses is generated at run time by addressing the error look-up table with the most significant bits of the Boolean input and by <b>using</b> <b>the</b> corresponding output <b>to</b> drive a calibration DAC whose output is summed with <b>the</b> original <b>DAC</b> output. <b>The</b> approach is applied at both the behavioral level and the circuit level in current-steering DAC.;The validity of this approach is verified by simulation. These simulations show that the dynamic nonlinearities can be dramatically reduced with this calibration scheme. The simulation results also show that this calibration approach is robust to errors in both the width and height of calibration pulses.;Experimental measurement results are also provided for a special case of this dynamic calibration algorithm that show that the dynamic performance can be improved through dynamic calibration, provided the mean error values in the table are close to their real values...|$|R
40|$|Micropower sensor {{networks}} {{have a broad}} range of applications which include military surveillance, environmental monitoring, chemical detection and more recently, medical monitoring systems. Each node of the sensor network requires energy efficient circuits powered off small batteries or harvested energy. In such systems, a single reconfigurable analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is needed to digitize a wide range of signals with varying bandwidth and resolution requirements. This thesis describes the design of an ADC whose power scales exponentially with resolution and linearly with frequency to maximize the system lifetime. The proposed ADC has reconfigurable resolution from 5 to 10 -bits and a scalable sample rate from 0 to 1 -MS/s. The successive approximation register (SAR) architecture was chosen for its highly digital nature which enables low voltage operation. The supply voltage can be scaled from 1 V down to 0. 4 V such that the ADC maintains a constant energy efficiency across all modes of operation when normalized with respect to sample rate and resolution. A capacitive digital-to -analog converter (DAC) in a split capacitor topology with a sub-DAC is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> minimize <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> power and area. Top plate switches are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> decouple <b>the</b> MSB capacitors as resolution is scaled to avoid parasitic loading of <b>the</b> <b>DAC.</b> <b>The</b> <b>DAC</b> capacitors are laid out in a common-centroid configuration with edge effects minimized at each resolution mode to improve matching. A fully dynamic latched comparator is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> avoid static bias currents. (cont.) Power gating of the digital logic is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> reduce leakage power at low sample rates. Reconfigurability between single-ended or differential modes enables a power versus performance trade-off. Lastly, programmable sampling duration and internal bootstrapping is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> maintain sampling linearity at low voltages.

40|$|Future systems {{powered by}} energy scavenging, e. g., {{wireless}} sen-sor nodes, demand μW-range ADCs with no static bias currents {{in order to}} have a power dissipation proportional to the sample rate. An ADC that meets these requirements by using a charge-redistri-bution DAC, a dynamic 2 -stage comparator, and a delay-line-based controller is realized in CMOS. Figure 12. 4. 1 shows a DAC based on charge redistribution, with a binary-weighted capacitor array [1]. The left side of every capaci-tor can be switched between a low reference voltage, Vref-, and a high reference voltage, Vref+, using a simple digital inverter. If the left side of capacitor CMSB is switched from low to high, the step on output VDAC is ΔVDAC = (Vref+- Vref-) *CMSB/Ctot, where Ctot is the total capacitance at the output node. The effect of the charge-redistrib-ution is reversible: if the left side of CMSB is switched from high to low, the output returns to its original value. This does not con-tribute any noise to the output voltage as there is no sampling involved. The switch at the output of <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> reset <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> voltage to Vref- to prevent DC drift due to leakage. This reset gives a thermal-noise voltage of kT/Ctot. The matching of metal-plate capacitors in a modern CMOS process is very good. For a 10 b converter with a total DAC capacitance Ctot= 600 fF; the matching is better than 0. 5 LSB. For this DAC, mismatch is dominant over thermal noise if the output-voltage range is more than ~ 0. 2 V. The inverter charging or discharging CMSB of 300 fF only sees the equivalent capacitor Ceq of 150 fF. If Vref+- Vref- is 1 V it takes only 150 fJ to switch Ceq from Vref- to Vref+ and back to Vref-. Thus, the theoretical energy per conversion in <b>the</b> <b>DAC</b> can be less than a few hundred fJ. This energy can even be lower if the charging and discharging of Ceq is done in multiple steps. This is shown in Fig. 12. 4. 2 where the voltage over Ceq i...|$|R

This paper presents the design and implementation of a programming primitive – Data Aggregation Call (DAC) – to exploit partition parallelism for clusterbased Internet services. A DAC request specifies a local processing operator and a global reduction operator, and it aggregates the local processing results from participating nodes through the global reduction operator. Applications may allow a DAC request to return partial aggregation results as a tradeoff between quality and availability. Our architecture design aims at improving interactive responses with sustained throughput for typical cluster environments where platform heterogeneity and software/hardware failures are common. At the cluster level, our load-adaptive reduction tree construction algorithm balances processing and aggregation load across servers while exploiting partition parallelism.
