5|$|One {{bereaved}} parent, Billy Ansel, distrusts Stephens {{and pressures}} Sam {{to drop the}} case; Nicole overhears <b>their</b> <b>argument.</b> In the pretrial deposition, Nicole unexpectedly accuses the bus driver Dolores of speeding, halting the lawsuit given Dolores' lack of deep pockets. Stephens and Nicole's father know she is lying but can do nothing. Two years later, Stephens sees Driscoll working as a bus driver in a city.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the party, Robert coaxes {{each of the}} {{employees}} into revealing their deepest fears. Before leaving, he tells a horror story implementing all their fears {{as a way to}} convince them not to let fear control their lives. This inspires Jim and Pam to stop <b>their</b> <b>argument</b> and Erin to talk to Andy about her feelings.|$|E
5|$|At {{the reunion}} party, Joey and Caitlin meet Alison Hunter (Sara Holmes), another Degrassi High attendee. As the evening progresses, Joey overhears Keith and Alison flirting {{with each other}} and Keith reveals {{he does not want to}} marry Caitlin. When Joey confronts Keith, <b>their</b> <b>argument</b> turns into a {{physical}} altercation, and Alison has to tell Caitlin about Keith's hesitance over getting married. Joey and Caitlin have a heart-to-heart discussion about their past and their relationships, and after ten years, finally make amends, while Wheels (Neil Hope) apologizes to Lucy for crippling her while driving drunk nine years ago.|$|E
50|$|In linguistics, {{selection}} {{denotes the}} ability of predicates to determine the semantic content of <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b> Predicates select <b>their</b> <b>arguments,</b> which means they limit the semantic content of <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b> One sometimes draws a distinction between types of selection; one acknowledges both s(emantic)-selection and c(ategory)-selection. Selection in general stands in contrast to subcategorization: predicates both select and subcategorize for <b>their</b> complement <b>arguments,</b> whereas they only select <b>their</b> subject <b>arguments.</b> Selection is a semantic concept, whereas subcategorization is a syntactic one.|$|R
50|$|Selection can {{be closely}} {{associated}} with thematic relations (e.g. agent, patient, theme, goal, etc.). By limiting the semantic content of <b>their</b> <b>arguments,</b> predicates are determining the thematic relations/roles that <b>their</b> <b>arguments</b> bear.|$|R
40|$|For {{biomedical}} information extraction, most systems use syntactic {{patterns on}} verbs (anchor verbs) and <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b> Anchor verbs can be selected {{by focusing on}} <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b> We propose to use predicate-argument structures (PASs), which are outputs of a full parser, to obtain verbs and <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b> In this paper, we evaluated PAS method by comparing it to a method using part of speech (POSs) pattern matching. POS patterns produced larger results with incorrect arguments, and the results will cause adverse effects on a phase selecting appropriate verbs. ...|$|R
5|$|Carol invites Therese to {{her home}} in New Jersey. She stops to {{purchase}} a Christmas tree and Therese takes candid photographs of her. Harge arrives unexpectedly to take Rindy to Florida for Christmas; he becomes suspicious of Therese as Carol had an affair years before with her friend Abby. Therese witnesses <b>their</b> <b>argument.</b> After Rindy leaves, a distressed Carol takes Therese {{to the train station}} so she can return home.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to <b>their</b> <b>argument,</b> Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E
5|$|Drug use {{is often}} portrayed in {{conjunction}} with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term hippie pejoratively. During <b>their</b> <b>argument,</b> Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to a Grateful Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching Teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the King had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after <b>their</b> <b>argument</b> in 1184. The bickering and simmering tensions between Henry and Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, Philip Augustus. Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated {{that he could be}} an assertive, calculating and manipulative political leader. Initially Henry and Philip Augustus had enjoyed a good relationship. Despite attempts to divide the two, Henry and Philip Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne. Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry. With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between Henry and Philip broke down.|$|E
5|$|With the WDL, Murray became {{active in}} the case of Odell Waller, a black Virginia {{sharecropper}} sentenced to death for killing his white landlord, Oscar Davis, during an argument. The WDL argued that Davis had cheated Waller in a settlement and as <b>their</b> <b>argument</b> grew more heated, Waller had shot Davis in legitimate fear of his life. Murray toured the country raising funds for Waller's appeal. She wrote to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Waller's behalf. Roosevelt in turn wrote to Virginia Governor James Hubert Price, asking him to guarantee that the trial was fair; she later persuaded the president to privately request Price to commute the death sentence. Through this correspondence, Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt began a friendship that would last until the latter's death two decades later. Despite the efforts of the WDL and the Roosevelts, however, the governor did not commute Waller's sentence. Waller was executed on July 2, 1942.|$|E
5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills. His hope was that Zedong would gain an apprenticeship with a Xiangtan rice merchant before taking over the family business and supporting his parents during their old age. Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of their}} ability to quote the sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout <b>their</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both sides {{use both}} anthropological and archaeological {{evidence}} to fuel <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b> They interpret cave paintings in Tsodilo Hills, {{and they also}} use artifacts such as faunal remains of cattle or sheep found at San sites. They even find Early Stone Age and Early Iron Age technologies at San sites, which both sides use to back <b>their</b> <b>arguments.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{explanation}} for this fact is that raising predicates do not semantically select <b>their</b> <b>arguments,</b> and therefore <b>their</b> <b>arguments</b> are not interpreted compositionally, as the subject or object of the raising predicate. Arguments of the control predicate, on the other hand, have to fulfill their semantic requirements, and interpreted as the argument of the predicate compositionally.|$|R
