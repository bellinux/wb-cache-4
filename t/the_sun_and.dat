5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face.

The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, {{like that of the}} clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels.
