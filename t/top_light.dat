5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank <b>top,</b> <b>light</b> brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E

He represented NWA New England at the NWA Anniversary Shows from 2000 to 2005, headlining three of his five appearances. In addition, he competed in the 2002 Jersey J-Cup as well as participating in international tours to Canada and the United Kingdom. DellaGatta also had brief stints in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment, participating in the WWE's Master Lock Challenge during 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{colouration}} of ichthyosaurs {{is difficult}} to determine. In 1956, Mary Whitear reported finding melanocytes, pigment cells in which reddish-brown pigment granules would still be present, in a skin specimen of a British fossil, R 509. Ichthyosaurs are traditionally assumed to have employed countershading (dark on <b>top,</b> <b>light</b> at the bottom) like sharks, penguins, and other modern animals, serving as camouflage during hunting. This was contradicted in 2014 by the discovery of melanosomes, black melanin-bearing structures, in the skin of ichthyosaur specimen YORYM 1993.338 by Johan Lindgren of Lund University. It was concluded that ichthyosaurs were likely uniformly dark coloured for thermoregulation and to camouflage them in deep water while hunting. This {{is in contrast to}} mosasaurids and prehistoric leatherback turtles, which were found to be countershaded.|$|E
25|$|Although Patterson fought {{around the}} light heavyweight limit {{for much of}} his early career, he and manager Cus D'Amato always had plans to fight for the Heavyweight Championship. In fact, D'Amato made these plans clear as early as 1954, when he told the press that Patterson was aiming for the heavyweight title. However, after Rocky Marciano {{announced}} his retirement as World Heavyweight Champion on April 27, 1956, Patterson was ranked by The Ring magazine as the <b>top</b> <b>light</b> heavyweight contender. After Marciano's announcement, Jim Norris of the International Boxing Club stated that Patterson was one of the six fighters who would take part in an elimination tournament to crown Marciano's successor. The Ring then moved Patterson into the heavyweight rankings, at number five.|$|E
25|$|Lara Croft is {{the main}} protagonist and playable {{character}} of the series: {{she is a woman}} who travels the world in search of forgotten artifacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfill her own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail. The character's classic outfit consists of a turquoise tank <b>top,</b> <b>light</b> brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and twin pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Eddie Sharkey and {{promoter}} Don Condello {{worked out}} an agreement for PWA wrestlers {{to appear in}} televised wrestling events in central Canada. Chris Markoff, Buck Zumhofe, Ricky Rice & Derrick Dukes and The Terminators (Riggs & Wolff) were among those who appeared in the territory. Pro Wrestling America, among other regional promotions such as Georgia All-Star Wrestling and the United States Wrestling Association, also had a working relationship with the Global Wrestling Federation during its last years and allowed its own wrestlers compete in GWF tournaments and other events. Jerry Lynn and The Lightning Kid, two of the promotion's <b>top</b> <b>light</b> heavyweight wrestlers, faced {{each other in a}} match to crown the first GWF Light Heavyweight Championship. A number of PWA wrestlers often appeared on The Prima-Donns, a long-running Public-access television cable TV show in the Minneapolis-area, including Eddie Sharkey, Baron von Raschke, Nick Bockwinkel and Jerry Lynn.|$|E

In his third MMA match, Bisping became the Cage Rage light heavyweight champion at Cage Rage 7, defeating Mark Epstein by technical knockout.

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} light {{attenuation}} and canopy photosynthesis suggest that crop photosynthesis increases by more uniform vertical irradiance within crops. This would result when a {{larger proportion of}} total irradiance is applied within canopies (interlighting) instead of from above (<b>top</b> <b>lighting).</b> These irradiance profiles can be generated by Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). We investigated the effects of interlighting with LEDs on light interception, on vertical gradients of leaf photosynthetic characteristics and on crop production and development of a greenhouse-grown Cucumis sativus'Samona' crop and analysed the interaction between them. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under low natural irradiance (winter) with supplemental irradiance of 221 micromol photosynthetic photon flux m(- 2) s(- 1) (20 h per day). In the interlighting treatment, LEDs (80 % Red, 20 % Blue) supplied 38 % of the supplemental irradiance within the canopy with 62 % as <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> by High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) -lamps. The control was 100 % <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> (HPS lamps). We measured horizontal and vertical light extinction as well as leaf photosynthetic characteristics at different leaf layers, and determined total plant production. Leaf mass per area and dry mass allocation to leaves were significantly greater but leaf appearance rate and plant length were smaller in the interlighting treatment. Although leaf photosynthetic characteristics were significantly increased in the lower leaf layers, interlighting did not increase total biomass or fruit production, partly because of a significantly reduced vertical and horizontal light interception caused by extreme leaf curling, likely because of the LED-light spectrum used, and partly because of the relatively low irradiances from abov...|$|R
2500|$|A Fresnel lantern (UK), {{or simply}} Fresnel (US), employs a Fresnel lens to wash light over {{an area of}} the stage. The lens is named after French {{physicist}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel, and consequently pronounced with a silent [...] "s". The distinctive lens has a 'stepped' appearance instead of the 'full' or 'smooth' appearance of those used in other lanterns. The resulting beam of light is wide and soft-edged, creating soft shadows, and is commonly used for back light, <b>top</b> <b>light,</b> and side light. Another method of controlling the spread of light is to use either a top hat (also referred to as a snoot), which generally limits the light coming out, or a barn door, whose flaps work as though they were shutters on an ERS (shown on the right). These methods limit light output and keep excess light from spilling into the eyes of audience members or where it is not desired.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Schilling and Canada's Simon Marcus went {{head to head}} in a bout to {{determine}} North America's <b>top</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight at Lion Fight: Battle in the Desert 5 in Las Vegas on February 25, 2012.

He was able to beat the count but Marcus went on the attack again and knocked Schilling out with a right elbow soon after. After the fight, Schilling's camp made the accusation that the sweep that Marcus used to daze him initially was illegal and appealed to the Nevada State Athletic Commission to have the bout result overturned to a no contest, which was rejected.|$|E
