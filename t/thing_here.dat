And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written.

500|$|One driver {{made his}} début at the race. Dale Coyne Racing {{was formed in}} what was {{described}} as an [...] "all-England" [...] team named Team St. George for a one-race deal with British American Racing Formula One test driver and ASCAR Days of Thunder series competitor Darren Manning. He performed [...] of shakedown running which included a mandatory [...] test for rookie drivers held under the observation of former CART driver Nicolas Minassian. Manning said {{of the decision to}} drive the team's No. 10 car: [...] "It's something special, a dream come true. To drive a Champ Car is a dream in itself, it's really got some horsepower. But the special <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> is {{to be a part of}} Team St. George." [...] He stated that he wanted to impress other teams but admitted to having a disadvantage in that he had not competed in the series beforehand.|$|E
500|$|Gdańsk {{became the}} focal point of the strike movement. On 21 August 1980, Mieczysław Jagielski {{replaced}} Tadeusz Pyka to lead a Polish government commission which was negotiating with strikers there. The strikers were represented by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union. Jagielski said of the negotiations that led to the agreement, [...] "We have spoken as Poles to Poles...There are no winners and losers. The important <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> is that we have understood each other and the best guarantee for what we have done is hard work." [...] He was reported to have spoken eloquently.|$|E

500|$|The song has {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH {{said that the}} song was [...] "probably the best <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> [...]" [...] He also complimented the [...] "brilliant bridge" [...] and {{the ending of the}} song where the caller gets through to her voicemail. Popjustice gave the song a positive review: [...] "It's a little bit like Gwen's 'What You Waiting For?' meets Timbaland's 'The Way I Are' meets about fifty other things... The structure's quite exciting... there is something tumultuously brilliant about Beyoncé's contribution that makes everything seem fine and as if it was the plan all along." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that [...] "The much talked-about Beyoncé collaboration 'Telephone', which—with its double-time beat and rapid-fire verses—proves {{to be one of the}} most adrenaline-pumped songs that Gaga has yet crafted, the whole thing feeling like it's about to veer of [...] the tracks at any moment simply due to the giddy excitement shared between the two divas, easily turning it into the unquestioned highlight of The Fame Monster". Mikael Woods from Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "Telephone" [...] is [...] " [...] a carefully considered meditation on how annoying it is when a dude keeps calling you while you're throwing down at the club." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular {{kind of things that}} were on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Evan Serpick of Entertainment Weekly awarded the album a [...] "B". While {{he felt that}} [...] "Couch Potato" [...] was, musically, up to par with Eminem's original, he noted, [...] "It’s hard to imagine today’s tough tykes choosing" [...] {{to listen to the}} somewhat tame parody. Serpick also felt that the Nelly and Avril Lavigne parodies were [...] "full of noisome effects and clownish voices that would make even the widest eyes roll." [...] He ended his review by praising the album's polka medley, saying it [...] "exposes the songs for the pretentious rock babble they are." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic claimed that the album was evidence that [...] "pop culture [...] ahead of Weird Al". He felt that many of songs belied an inherent misconception of youth culture on the part of Yankovic, and that with Poodle Hat, the artist was [...] "offering generalizations about a culture he doesn't understand". But while he claimed that the record [...] "stumbles over the obviousness and awfulness of its parodies", Erlewine enjoyed [...] "Hardware Store," [...] "Why Does This Always Happen to Me?", and [...] "Genius in France" [...] (for being [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "intricate"; a sensitive piano pop tune with a good send-up of narcissistic lyrics and nice, layered vocal harmonies; and [...] "the most ambitious and weirdest <b>thing</b> <b>here,</b> which counts for a lot," [...] respectively). The writers of The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album two stars, denoting a record that is [...] "fair to poor" [...] and that [...] "fall below an artist's establish standard". A review of the album by Billboard, however, praised the album, noting that it [...] "crackles with amusing parodies", proving that Yankovic is [...] "a sharp observer of the world—and that's what makes [...] such an enduring, compelling figure." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} , {{the podium}} {{positions}} were unchanged, but the time difference between Loeb and Sordo had decreased to seven seconds, although the gap between first place and fourth was over a minute. Petter Solberg {{had dropped out of}} contention for points, in ninth place overall, eighth being taken by Jan Kopecký in a privately entered [...] Before [...] got underway, the crews had a chance to change their tyres to a set with a more suitable compound. A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence. Loeb won an uneventful , but only by one-tenth of a second ahead of Sordo, and on [...] Sordo was quicker than Loeb, after Loeb stalled on the start-line and was unable to make up the lost seconds. At the midday break, Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo. [...] "Now it's a big battle between the two C4s. The other cars for the moment are behind, so it's good news for the team. It would be easier if Dani were bit further behind but I have to deal wit that," [...] he said. [...] "I'll try to keep position this afternoon, but it's not easy. Dani is really fast. I only have a six-second lead." [...] Grönholm was also complaining. [...] " [...] The only good <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> is to win this rally, but to drive here; I don't like it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group were}} {{supposed}} to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield {{the day after the}} departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: [...] "None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few <b>thing</b> <b>here</b> and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process." [...] Two tracks of the album were composed in that session: [...] "Love Thing" [...] and [...] "Say You'll Be There". In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, east London.|$|E
