5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends <b>their</b> <b>client</b> and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and <b>their</b> <b>client</b> is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

5|$|While Roman {{emperors}} {{almost always}} married wives {{who were also}} Roman citizens, the ruling families of the empire's client kingdoms in the Near East and North Africa often contracted marriages with other royal houses to consolidate their position. These marriages were often contracted with the approval, or even at the behest, of the Roman emperors themselves. Rome thought that such marriages promoted stability among <b>their</b> <b>client</b> states and prevented petty local wars that would disturb the Pax Romana. Glaphyra of Cappadocia was known to have contracted three such royal intermarriages: with Juba II, King of Numidia and Mauretania, Alexander of Judea and Herod Archelaus, Ethnarch of Samaria.|$|E

40|$|The {{profession}} {{of social work}} prides itself on being value neutral and non-judgmental. However, social workers might impose their values upon <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> {{if they are not}} aware of their own biases. Ideologies and values stemming from one?s socioeconomic class may serve as significant barriers between the social worker and the client. Consequently, it would seem essential for a social worker recognize any socioeconomic class contrast between themselves and <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> The failure to acknowledge the significance of class might cause them to impose their middle class values upon <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> To gauge the validity of this concept, I did an extensive literature review of sociological articles, studies, and books; I interviewed ten social workers; and I completed an analysis of my findings. The objective of the interviews is to understand the social workers? perceptions of socioeconomic class, inter-class relationships, and lower-class clients. The findings indicate that the social workers recognize a class difference between themselves and <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> Additionally, this study found that the social workers did not find themselves as imposing onto <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> There may be unintentional bias towards <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> but more research is needed...|$|R

5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, Yugoslavia {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came under {{increasing}} pro-Axis political pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or <b>their</b> <b>client</b> states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact. Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.|$|E

On 17 September 1990, General Võ Nguyên Giáp also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance. Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken <b>their</b> <b>client</b> regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt travelled to Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, and they issued an 11-point communiqué re-establishing diplomatic ties {{between the two countries}} after 10 years without formal relations.|$|E
5|$|Off the field, {{the season}} was one of much {{conflict}} for Ramirez. Persistent trade rumors (generally involving the New York Mets) dogged him all season. After the Red Sox were eliminated {{in the first round}} of that year's playoffs by the eventual World Series champion Chicago White Sox, Ramirez once again expressed a wish to be traded. This included a threat to not show up for spring training if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM Theo Epstein. Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his Ritz-Carlton condominium up for sale. Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly going to the Baltimore Orioles or the New York Mets, but no deal was reached. By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping the demand. His agents, in turn, insisted <b>their</b> <b>client</b> was still open to a trade.

5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} <b>their</b> <b>client</b> had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{prepared}} a massive strike for 737, however, intended {{to end the}} war for good. Marwan apparently went to Damascus in person to persuade Hisham to back this project and was successful: an army 120,000 strong was assembled, comprising regular forces of Syria and the Jazira, as well as volunteers for the jihad, Armenian troops under Ashot Bagratuni, and even armed camp followers and servants. The number is clearly an exaggeration, but whatever the real size of Marwan's army, it was a huge force and certainly the largest ever sent against the Khazars. Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and <b>their</b> <b>client</b> Ashot. He then pushed into Iberia, driving its Chosroid ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of Anakopia on the Black Sea coast, in the Byzantine protectorate of Abkhazia. Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself, but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of dysentery among his troops.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges and the Roxolani invaded Lower Pannonia and Lower Moesia, respectively, in 117.

The Dacian provincial governor, Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus, was killed in the invasion. The Roxolani surrendered first, so {{it is likely that the}} Romans exiled and then replaced <b>their</b> <b>client</b> king with one of their choosing. The Iazyges then concluded peace with Rome. The Iazyges and other Sarmatians invaded Roman Dacia in 123, likely for the same reason as the previous war of not being allowed to visit and trade with each other, Marcius Turbo stationed a thousand legionaries in Potaissa and Porolissum. The Romans probably used these towns as the invasion point into Rivulus Dominarum. Marcius Turbo succeeded in defeating the Iazyges; however, the terms of the peace, and the date, are not known.|$|E

Alicia serves as second chair for senior partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) in a murder trial. <b>Their</b> <b>client,</b> Brad Broussard (Tom Degnan), is charged with shooting Miles Wagner. Wagner was an unpopular mutual fund manager who defrauded Broussard and many other out of their life savings by assisting in Bernard Madoff's investment scandal. Broussard was found covered in blood next to Wagner's body, but insists on his innocence. Diane consults ballistics expert Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a mustachioed country man with a strict principle {{that he will not}} work if the client is guilty. Kurt testifies that Wagner was shot inside a car despite being found on the floor. Wagner's partner, Martin Knox (Kevin O'Rourke), had a strong financial motive to kill Wagner. Knox's wife, Rachel (Geraldine Hughes), strongly dislikes her husband and is willing to implicate him, but is bound by spousal privilege laws. Alicia discovers a conspiracy tactic that will allow Rachel to testify, and Broussard is vindicated and set free.

Delaney asks Kalinda to feed her information about Peter, but Kalinda declines.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as <b>their</b> <b>client,</b> witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
