25|$|Structures in {{sedimentary}} rocks {{can be divided}} into 'primary' structures (formed during deposition) and 'secondary' structures (formed after deposition). Unlike textures, structures are always large-scale features that can easily be studied in the field. Sedimentary structures can indicate something about the sedimentary environment or can serve <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> side originally faced up where tectonics have tilted or overturned sedimentary layers.|$|E

Provided that the spaceship is sufficiently small so that tidal effects are non-measurable (given the sensitivity of current gravity measurement instrumentation, A and B presumably should be Lilliputians), there are no experiments that A and B can perform which will enable them <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> setting they are in.|$|E
25|$|At 2.30 pm, {{the police}} {{set fire to}} the {{building}} {{to try to make the}} rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building. Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building. He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E
25|$|Blue jays {{can make}} a large variety of sounds, and {{individuals}} may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other corvids, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> it is. Their voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive {{them away from the}} jays' nests.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} format of the match, these two {{strategies}} will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain to be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it.|$|E
25|$|There is no precise {{measurement}} {{of the costs of}} regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, {{it is unlikely that the}} effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The Economist estimated the annual costs of anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, it is almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{artifacts}} {{discovered at}} La Venta have been crucial to starting to understand Olmec religion and ideology. For example, hematite and iron-ore mirror fragments {{have been discovered}} in abundance at La Venta. Mirrors were an incredibly important part of Olmec society, used in both rituals and daily life. Celts, or “pseudo-axes,” are extremely common in both burials and offerings. It is unclear whether these artifacts were actually used in any practical way or if their meaning is ritual or symbolic. Most are smooth, but quite a few are decorated with what has been interpreted as representing religious symbolism. Such celts and other jade artifacts were offered to deities during ceremonies at La Venta and the belief in supernatural beings is evidenced in Olmec artifacts. However, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> important figures remaining on the stone monuments and artifacts are gods and which are human leaders. In fact, {{there might have been}} little difference between the divine and the Olmec king, in their ideology.|$|E

25|$|Although scandalized by Don Ciccio's stories, the Prince at last {{asks the}} {{question}} that's really on his mind—what is Angelica truly like? Ciccio speaks rapturously of her beauty, poise, and sophistication, and then speaks {{about how her}} parents' vulgarity seems to have not affected her. The Prince bristles, and informs Don Ciccio that from now on, because Angelica and Tancredi are to be married, the Serdàras must be spoken about with appropriate respect. Ciccio, who has believed that Tancredi was attempting to seduce Angelica in order to embarrass her father, is horrified. He bursts out that for Tancredi and Angelica to marry will cause {{the end of the}} good qualities of the Salina and Falconieri families. The Prince thinks to himself, however, that the marriage will not be the end, but the beginning. As the Prince and Don Ciccio return to Donnafugata, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> of them is Don Quixote and which is Sancho Panza.|$|E

In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote {{that it is hard to}} tell Frink and his father's voices apart: [...] "Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> one of the two nutty professors is talking."

Degrassi focuses on a high school with a disparate student body, with countless individual stories <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> (<b>which</b> is why the franchise has lasted this long). There's nothing corny or sweet about [...] "Degrassi" [...] as it boldly tackles everything from obesity to date rape, thongs to drugs". Others, such as The Advocate gave praise and said the series was breaking new ground by depicting a gay romance between two teenaged boys.|$|E

500|$|Diogenes (c. 412–323 BC) {{dominates the}} story of Cynicism like no other figure. [...] He {{originally}} went to Athens, fleeing his home city, after he and his father, {{who was in charge}} of the mint at Sinope, got into trouble for falsifying the coinage. [...] (The phrase [...] "defacing the currency" [...] later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.) [...] Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes, but it is by no means certain that they ever met. [...] Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes' teachings and the ascetic way of life, pursuing a life of self-sufficiency (autarkeia), austerity (askēsis), and shamelessness (anaideia). [...] There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism (sleeping in a tub), his shameless behaviour (eating raw meat), and his criticism of conventional society ("bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters"), and although it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> of these stories are true, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness.|$|E
500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It {{goes without saying that}} One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named Na, Na, Na. It was impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E
