Both these ladies were therefore staunch in their defence of Mr. Crawley. The archdeacon himself had his own reasons,--reasons which for the present he kept altogether within his own bosom,--for wishing that Mr. Crawley had never entered the diocese.

40|$|Side {{effects of}} {{prescribed}} medications {{are a common}} occurrence. Electronic healthcare databases present the opportunity <b>to</b> identify new <b>side</b> effects efficiently but currently the methods are limited due to confounding (i. e. when an association between two variables is identified due to them both being associated to a third variable). In this {{paper we propose a}} proof of concept method that learns common associations and uses this knowledge <b>to</b> automatically refine <b>side</b> effect signals (i. e. exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the signal instances that are most likely <b>to</b> correspond <b>to</b> <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effect occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the outcome within 60 days of the exposure. Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i. e. exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely <b>to</b> correspond <b>to</b> <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule mining parameters for specific health outcomes. This paper shows that {{it may be possible to}} filter signals at a patient level based on association rules learned from considering patients' medical histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate the tuning of the method's parameters.

Round the city, {{at a distance of}} about thirteen hundred yards from it, he dug a ditch, nowhere less than twelve feet wide and eight deep, but, where most exposed to an attack, eighteen feet wide and twelve deep. Within the circuit of this ditch he erected eight large forts and connected them with a long and thick earthen parapet strengthened with bastions. On the ramparts and forts three hundred cannon, for the most part supplied by the city of Nuremberg, were placed in position. As the camp between the ramparts and the town was traversed by the river Pegnitz numerous bridges were thrown across it, so that the whole force could concentrate on either side in case of attack. So vigorously did the army, assisted by the citizens, labour at these works, that they were completed in fourteen days after Gustavus reached Nuremberg.|$|R

40|$|In ICF, the {{understanding}} of laser plasma scattering processes is essential for laser target coupling and in controlling the symmetry of indirect drive implosions. The existing Nova Full Aperture Backscatter Station (FABS) has been useful in understanding laser plasma instabilities occurring in hohlraums by measuring the quantity, spectral distribution and near-field spatial distributions of Brillouin and more recently Raman backscatter. Equally important is {{an understanding of the}} farfield spatial intensity distribution which provides information on density, temperature and velocity gradient distributions, and which affect capsule implosion symmetry in hohlraums. Such information could potentially help in understanding processes such as filamentation and saturation mechanism. This paper describes a broad-band, color-corrected far-field imager and associated diagnostics capable of imaging the source of scattered light to better than 25 {micro}m resolution.

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{agriculture}} is developing towards {{the direction of}} intelligent. We can realize the nondestructive measurement of plant leaf area by using the digital camera. In this paper, we make the same ratio between the camera’s screen and the background plate to overcome the problem of geometric distortion. Then we use two perpendicular digital cameras from the front and <b>side</b> <b>to</b> collect <b>images</b> respectively for curved leaf. Because there are characteristics of the image grey value mutation on the rage of the vane, we can extract the leaf by image segmentation. The leaf area can be calculated by the statistic of the pixels number according to the projection principle. Experiments show that, the error of leaf area measurement reduces from 13. 51 % to 5. 93 % by binocular vision. So this method not only can get the measurement of leaf area data, but also can effectively avoid the two-dimensional image distortion and improve the accuracy of leaf area calculation...|$|R
40|$|The neutron {{radiography}} facility of the Egyptian Second Experimental and Training Research Reactor (ETRR- 2) holds promising opportunities for nuclear {{as well as}} non-nuclear applications. Future improvements include using the direct method of imaging as well as using a dynamic system, which necessitates using digital image processing. The neutron multiple-scattering in the sample by far is the most challenging problem in neutron imaging. A recent technique to correct for the thermal neutron scattering is applied for the ETRR- 2 {{neutron radiography}} facility. In this method, the <b>side</b> <b>image</b> is used <b>to</b> correct for the scattered neutrons {{that would result in}} a better forward image. Since the dynamic system is not yet installed in the facility, the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the imaging process using the MCNP-B code. Visual basic codes are developed to read and plot the Monte Carlo simulation output as well as to process the obtained image. This includes symetrizing the obtained <b>side</b> <b>images</b> and subtracting the <b>side</b> <b>images</b> form the forward one.
