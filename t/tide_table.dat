5000|$|A river {{crossing}} was {{built at the}} site of London Bridge. London Bridge is now used as the basis for published <b>tide</b> <b>tables</b> giving the times of high tide. High tide reaches Putney about 30 minutes later than London Bridge, and Teddington about an hour later. The tidal stretch of the river is known as [...] "the Tideway". <b>Tide</b> <b>tables</b> are published by the Port of London Authority and are available online. Times of high and low tides are also posted on Twitter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tide</b> <b>tables</b> are {{published}} in various forms, such as paper-based tables and tables {{available on the}} Internet. Most <b>tide</b> <b>tables</b> are calculated and published only for major ports, called [...] "standard ports", and only for one year — standard ports can be relatively close together or hundreds of kilometers aprt.

50|$|The {{river and}} the Hangzhou Bay are known for the world's largest tidal bore. The oldest known <b>tide</b> <b>table</b> (AD 1056) is for the Qiantang River and may have aided ancient {{tourists}} wishing to see the famous tidal bore. The tide rushing into the river mouth from the bay causes a bore which can reach up to 9 metres (30 ft) in height, and travel at up to 40 km per hour (25 miles an hour). Known locally as the Silver (or Black) Dragon, the wave sweeps past Hangzhou, menacing shipping in the harbor.|$|E
50|$|The North River is {{a popular}} river for kayakers {{as well as for}} small boats. There are several {{locations}} to load into the water. One at Bridge Street in Norwell, Union Street in Marshfield, Chittenden Lane in Norwell, Driftway Park in Scituate and upriver on the Indian Head River a tributary to the North River in Hanover off Indian Head Drive. The North and South Rivers Watershed Association has a kayak guide and map explaining more about using the rivers. Tide is a major factor in determining timing of putting in and taking out. The North and South Rivers Watershed Association has an offset <b>tide</b> <b>table</b> for different locations along the river. Public parking is available at these locations.|$|E
50|$|Mudflat hiking (Vadehavsvandring, Wadlopen, West Frisian: Waadrinnen, Wattwandern) is a {{recreation}} enjoyed by Dutch, Germans, Danes, {{and others in}} the Netherlands, northwest Germany and in Denmark. Mudflat hikers are people who, {{with the aid of a}} <b>tide</b> <b>table,</b> use a period of low water to walk and wade on the watershed of the mudflats, especially from the Frisian mainland coast to the Frisian islands. The Wadden Sea, a belt of the North Sea, is well suited to this traditional practice. Belts of this shallow sea lie off the mainland of the Netherlands, between Friesland and the Frisian Islands; off the coast of northwestern Germany; and off the coast of southwest Jutland in Denmark.|$|E

50|$|Other {{work in the}} USCGS took {{precedence}} over construction of the new machine, {{and a reduction in}} staff levels precluded all work on the new machine for three years. As a result, Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 was not functional until 1910. It was first applied to predicting values for the 1912 and 1913 <b>tide</b> <b>tables.</b> Then the machine was disassembled, polished, plated, lacquered, and reassembled in time to provide predictions for the 1914 <b>tide</b> <b>tables.</b> Comparisons of the accuracy of the mechanical predictions of tides compared to hand calculations for two challenging locations demonstrated errors in heights of 0.72 in or less.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{narrow gauge}} railway {{was built in}} 1933/1934 from Cecilienkoog over a pile-supported {{embankment}} to Nordstrandischmoor in order to transport construction material for the sea defences of the hallig. Its length was 7 km. On 1 March 1956 the line was destroyed by ice floes, but later rebuilt. In 1977 the pile dam was filled with rubble to make the line more stable. When the new outer dyke around the Beltringharder Koog was completed, the section of track between the Cecilien Koog and the new outer dyke was abandoned. The annual figures given for this are 1985 and 1988. The rest of the line is still in operation and now has a route length of 3.6 km. In 2000, a new, paved Lorendamm embankment built, which can now be worked largely independently of the <b>tide</b> <b>table</b> and is only impassable {{when there is a}} storm surge.|$|E
5000|$|In {{accordance}} with Yokoi's conception, St.GIGA's broadcasts initially followed no externally fixed (or artificial) timetable. Rather they were {{based upon the}} cyclical motif of a 24-hour [...] "tide table" [...] where broadcast themes were approximately matched to the current tidal cycle according {{to the rule of}} twelfths throughout the 24-hour broadcasting period. Under this innovative schedule, the station broadcast a variety of primarily ambient music programs including Music Tide (Ongaku Chouryuu), various jazz programs, and <b>Tide</b> <b>Table</b> (Taido [...] Teburu) (featuring live sound-broadcasts of the ocean shore). The beginnings and ends of programs were not clearly demarcated and instead utilized the unprecedented [...] "Tide of Sound" [...] (Oto no Chouryuu) method where songs of one genre would gradually flow into and intersperse with the songs from the prior genre until the new genre became predominant. The intent, according to Yokoi was to allow the listener to relax in a wave of sound [...] "like a baby sleeps in the womb." [...] "Tide of Sounds" [...] broadcasts operated under a principle of [...] "No Commercials, No DJs, No News Broadcasts, No Talk." [...] Unlike most commercial-driven radio broadcasts, this was made possible for St.GIGA due to its reliance on a subscription Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) service. In order to receive this DAB service, the subscriber was required to obtain a special decoder, to pay an initiation fee, and subsequent monthly fees. [...] "Tide of Sounds" [...] broadcasts often took the form of high-quality digital recordings of nature sounds accompanied by spoken word narration by an actor as the [...] "Voice." [...] Throughout the life span of [...] "Tide of Sounds" [...] broadcasts, the part of the [...] "Voice" [...] would be played by a number of notable Japanese poets including Ryo Michiko among others. [...] "Voice" [...] performances often consisted of all new poetry composed specifically for the show.|$|E
