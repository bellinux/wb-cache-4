5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be caught by a fishing rod.|$|E
5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rare}} {{situations}} where both parents have an expanded HD gene, the risk increases to 75%, and when either parent has two expanded copies, {{the risk is}} 100% (all children will be affected). Individuals with both genes affected are rare. For some time HD {{was thought to be}} the only disease for which possession of a second mutated gene did not affect symptoms and progression, but it has since been found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> affect the phenotype and the rate of progression.|$|E

5|$|Natural calcium is {{a mixture}} of five stable {{isotopes}} (40Ca, 42Ca, 43Ca, 44Ca, and 46Ca) and one isotope with a half-life so long <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be considered stable for all practical purposes (48Ca, with a half-life of about 4.3×1019years). Calcium is the first (lightest) element to have six naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E
5|$|One of the Port of San Diego's two cargo {{facilities}} {{is located in}} Downtown San Diego at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal. This terminal has facilities for containers, bulk cargo, and refrigerated and frozen storage, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> handle the import and export of many commodities. In 2009 the Port of San Diego handled 1,137,054 short tons of total trade; foreign trade accounted for 956,637 short tons while domestic trade amounted to 180,417 short tons.|$|E
5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of {{the sex industry}} argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction {{does not mean that the}} species is extinct, merely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E

5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E

5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can,</b> so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E

5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either from the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that {{it is from the}} kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
