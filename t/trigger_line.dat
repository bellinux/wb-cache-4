If the engine stalls e.g. cooling fan activation the ignition point is advanced up to 20 ° BTDC {{in order to increase}} the engines torque to restore the idle RPM. In the same way the ignition is retarded if the engines RPM is increased. When the TPS senses an increase in throttle opening the ECU leaves the idle ignition timing map and regulates the ignition timing in respect of load and engine speed.|$|E
30|$|Four Hamamatsu PMT {{assemblies}} with scintillators and lightguides, two in {{the front}} and {{two in the}} back of the telescope, define the spatial acceptance for triggers. The crossed scintillators on either side of the beam telescope define a rectangular acceptance window of 20 mm× 10 mm matching the MIMOSA 26 sensor area. The TLU is based on a commercial Spartan 3 board and features a coincidence unit with discriminator boards accepting up to four PMT input signals. Additionally, it is equipped with several custom-made add-on PCBs allowing for an easy integration of user DAQ systems. Providing a programmable logic, the TLU takes a trigger decision based on its four input channels. As interface to the beam telescope DAQ and other user DAQs, the TLU provides RJ 45 connectors with four LVDS pairs carrying the trigger clock, busy, reset, and trigger signals. The trigger clock and the busy line are inputs to the TLU, whereas the reset and the <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> are signals produced by the TLU. The trigger signal is distributed to all DAQ systems on the <b>trigger</b> <b>line.</b> A busy signal is accepted by the TLU from each integrated DAQ individually vetoing subsequent triggers as long as the busy signal is high. More details are available in references [13, 14]. In addition, a LEMO interface is available providing trigger and reset outputs and inputs for the busy signal.|$|E

The TLU then de-asserts the trigger and waits for the busy line going low. The trigger data handshake mode uses the same scheme as in the simple handshake mode, but additionally the current trigger data are transferred on the trigger line: after the trigger has been de-asserted, the trigger number is clocked out.|$|E

40|$|The {{repression}} of transgene expression by RNA silencing {{can affect the}} development of genetically modified plants for both research and agronomical purposes. It remains unclear why some transgenes when introduced into plants undergo silencing whereas other identical transgenes do not. Additionally, some transgenes when silenced can support DNA methylation whereas others cannot. One possibility for this variation {{is that there are}} locus-specific effects influencing a transgene’s potential to undergo RNA silencing and/or DNA methylation. These locus-specific effects may be a result of either the site of transgene integration or be due to the properties of the transgene locus itself. This research has aimed to address these questions by generating and characterizing multiple independent single locus GFP transgenic Arabidopsis lines that have been triggered to undergo silencing by crossing with an amplicon <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> (AMP 243). The ability of these lines to undergo RDR 6 -dependent Post Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS) and/or RNA directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) has been investigated in an attempt to correlate characteristics of the transgene in each independent line with RNA silencing outcomes. Additionally, epitope-tagged versions of RDR 2 and RDR 6 have been generated in order to investigate their potential recruitment to target loci. The data presented in this body of work supports there being no locus-specific effect on RNA silencing. For example, amplicon-triggered RDR 6 -dependent PTGS occurred in all the independent lines suggesting that RDR 6 activity is not influenced by either genome location or locus structure. Despite the production of high levels of small interfering RNAs, not all lines supported detectable levels of RdDM in the F 1 of the crosses with the <b>trigger</b> <b>line.</b> However, the results presented here clearly demonstrate that the levels of RdDM increase over a generation. Additionally, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed that amplicon-triggered RdDM was not associated with changes in the histone marks H 3 Ac or H 3 K 9 me. This suggests that this non-canonical pathway of DNA methylation may not be linked with changes in histone modification, although testing will be required in order to strengthen this conclusion. ...|$|E

In such contexts, radioactive sources cannot be used to produce a known signal to calibrate the measured energy spectrum during data taking. In this paper we present an instrument designed to generate ultra-stable and very precise calibrating pulse, which can be used to stabilize the response of bolometers during data taking. The instrument is characterized by the presence of multi-outputs, a completely programmable pulse width and amplitude and a dedicated daisy-chained optical <b>trigger</b> <b>line.</b> It can be fully controlled and monitored remotely via CAN bus protocol. An energy resolution of the order of 20 eV FWHM at 1 MeV (2 eV FWHM at 10 keV) and a thermal stability of the order of 0. 1 ppm/C have been achieved.

30|$|The zero-suppressed hit data {{generated}} by the MIMOSA 26 sensors are transmitted over a ribbon cable to the auxiliary boards, which establish the connection to the data concentrator board collecting the data from all six sensors and the trigger/busy lines from the TLU. The signals from the concentrator board are acquired by a COTS 2 DAQ system built around the National Instrument (NI) PXIe crate architecture. A custom-made firmware running on a Virtex 5 FPGA embedded in a FlexRIO board (PXIe 7962 R) acquires and deserialises the 12 serial links – two per sensor – at 80 Mb/s, detects triggers on the <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> and reads the trigger data, which are the bottom 15 bits of the trigger counter. The resulting data stream of 960 Mb/s is read by the CPU (PXIe 8130) from the PXIe bus via a DMA channel and processed on-line by software. Data packets on which the TLU has triggered are selected, demultiplexed and actual frames built. The data are then available to the EUDAQ framework (cf. “The EUDAQ data acquisition framework” section), and an event is written to disk in normal handshake mode, only if a trigger has been raised for a certain telescope readout frame. This co-development, i.e. sharing processing tasks between firmware and software, allows for high flexibility for system upgrades. The presented DAQ architecture is able to read six MIMOSA 26 sensors without any dead-time at up to 8680 frames/s. More details are available in references [15, 16].|$|E

At the expected nominal LHC operating conditions only about 0. 0005 % of the collision events can be kept for physics analysis in ATLAS. Therefore the understanding and evaluation of the trigger performance {{is one of the}} most crucial parts of any physics analysis. ATLAS’s first level trigger is composed of custom-built hardware, while the second and third levels are implemented using regular PCs running reconstruction and selection algorithms. Because of this split, accessing the results of the trigger execution for the two stages is different. The complexity of the software trigger presents further difficulties in accessing the trigger data. To make the job of the physicists easier when evaluating the trigger performance, multiple general-use tools are provided by the ATLAS Trigger Analysis Tools group. The TrigDecisionTool, a general tool, is provided to retrieve the results of the trigger execution, which are the passed/failed decision for each <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> and the objects reconstructed by the trigger together with their ancestral relations.

40|$|Current fusion devices {{consist of}} {{multiple}} diagnostics and hundreds or {{even thousands of}} signals. This situation forces on multiple occasions to use distributed data acquisition systems as the best approach. In this type of distributed systems, {{one of the most}} important issues is the synchronization between signals, so that it is possible to have a temporal correlation as accurate as possible between the acquired samples of all channels. In last decades, many fusion devices use different types of video cameras to provide inside views of the vessel during operations and to monitor plasma behavior. The synchronization between each video frame and the rest of the different signals acquired from any other diagnostics is essential in order to know correctly the plasma evolution, since it is possible to analyze jointly all the information having accurate knowledge of their temporal correlation. The developed system described in this paper allows timestamping image frames in a real-time acquisition and processing system using 1588 clock distribution. The system has been implemented using FPGA based devices together with a 1588 synchronized timing card (see Fig. 1). The solution is based on a previous system [1] that allows image acquisition and real-time image processing based on PXIe technology. This architecture is fully compatible with the ITER Fast Controllers [2] and offers integration with EPICS to control and monitor the entire system. However, this set-up is not able to timestamp the frames acquired since the frame grabber module does not present any type of timing input (IRIG-B, GPS, PTP). To solve this lack, an IEEE 1588 PXI timing device its used to provide an accurate way to synchronize distributed data acquisition systems using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) IEEE 1588 2008 standard. This local timing device can be connected to a master clock device for global synchronization. The timing device has a buffer timestamp for each PXI <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> and requires tha- a software application assigns each frame the corresponding timestamp. The previous action is critical and cannot be achieved if the frame rate is high. To solve this problem, it has been designed a solution that distributes the clock from the IEEE 1588 timing card to all FlexRIO devices [3]. This solution uses two PXI trigger lines that provide the capacity to assign timestamps to every frame acquired and register events by hardware in a deterministic way. The system provides a solution for timestamping frames to synchronize them with the rest of the different signals...|$|E

This consists of the EMT signals M 20, G 20, E 20, X 20, Y 10 (subscripts denote number of bits); the DCT signals B 16, A 16, A ′ 16; and the IFT signal U 3 for patterns representing various muon track topologies. A {{detailed description of the}} overall L 1 trigger structure and trigger primitive definitions {{can be found in the}} DCT upgrade requirements document [1]. The DCT input signals B,A from the BLT for short and long tracks will remain the same as before. The A ’ for high pT tracks is from the current PTDs. The new ZPD system replacing the existing PTDs have a baseline output pattern of 4 bits per ZPD, summing to a total of 32 bits input to the GLT for the 8 ZPD boards. The input from GLT backplane to the GLT is limited by the current active pins routed to the receiver FPGAs. To accommodate the new ZPDs, 16 bits of the ZPD input can use the existing input slot for the A’. The other 16 bits will displace the existing EMT X signal, since the X signal has not been used by any existing L 1 configuration. The new GLTi board will have a switch to allow the exchange between the new ZPD signal and the EMT X. 2 GLT Modifications for ZPD Signals The top level diagram of the GLT internal logic is shown in Figure 1. There are a total of 17 objects derived from the input signals used for the <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> decisions. Some of the inputs are used to derive more than one object, e. g. the B is used for nB, nB * and nBM. Among the existing objects, three of them were never used for any production configuration: AM,A’M,BMX, i. e. most of the Match objects. Given that the X signal carrying the new ZPD signals is directed to the Match FPGA, a firmware modification allow many possible options of using the (A’,X) coming from the ZPD to derive 3 types of objects. Our actual operating experience shows that the kinematically stringent signals such as A’ are expected to be only used with the criteria of A≥ 1, as requiring 2 or more are generally too inefficient and biased. The A ’ signal therefore doesn’t need to use the 16 φ bits for 1 Contact perso...|$|E

40|$|The {{charm quark}} plays an {{important}} role in testing the Standard-Model (SM) because it represents a unique opportunity to study the possible coupling of non-SM particles with the up-type quark sector. In this respect, CP violation is a powerful tool for investigating possible New Physics effects. This field is only partially explored to date both theoretically and experimentally; in fact the first evidence for the D^ 0 -bar(D^ 0) mixing was obtained only a few years ago. A theoretical description is not straightforward, since the masses of charmed hadrons, O(2 GeV), belong to a range where non-perturbative hadronic physics is operative and the phenomenological approximations commonly used in the strange and bottom sectors are of little help. Current theoretical approachesto charm dynamics are based on establishing relations among decay rates in different modes through amplitudes and phases, allowing to extract the theoretical parameters by fitting the measured branching-fractions in several decay channels, therefore collecting as many measurements as possible in different decay modes is crucial in reducing theoretical uncertainties and advancing our limited understanding of the physics of the charm sector. In this context, the LHCb experiment at CERN with its potential of collecting large samples of charm-decays represents an interesting opportunity. The decay modes of charm mesons with an eta meson (eta/eta') in the final state, are an interesting area in need of better measurements. They amount to a relevant fraction of the hadronic decays (~ 30 %), and are still incompletely known: the D_s branching fractions have significant uncertainties, and the measurements of CP asymmetries have uncertainties of 1 - 4 %, which is insufficient to test the expected CPV effects ( eta^(') pi^+ (charge conjugation is implied throughout this summary) channels at a hadronic machine. We show that it is possible to perform a good reconstruction at LHCb by using a eta^(') decay channel with at least two charged particles in the final state (e. g. pi^+pi^-gamma). The two pion-tracks, which are reconstructed with high accuracy by the LHCb tracking system, combined with the pion from the D decay track and the calorimeter information allowto reconstruct the decay vertex and the photon-momentum with good precision. An additional improvement is provided by constraining the eta^(') -daughter-particles to the eta^(') mass. Due to their experimental difficulty, the investigation of these decay modes was not taken into consideration at LHCb during Run I. This has important implications on the data available for our analysis. LHCb data is collected by selecting only the small fraction of events passing some strict selection criteria (``trigger lines"), aimed at well-defined decay channels, and none of these trigger lines had been foreseen for the decays of our interest. We have therefore exploited for our study the data selected by a <b>trigger</b> <b>line</b> devised with a different aim: the reconstruction of D^+-> h^+h^+h^- decays. We determined that a sufficient number of decays of our interest are selected within that line as a side-effect. A selection optimized to improve the signal/background (S/B) ratio was performed. As a result the S/B is improved from 0. 08 (0. 3) to 1 (4) for the D(D_s) in the eta channel, and from 0. 4 (1. 5) to 3 (14) for the D(D_s) in the eta' channel. The resulting number of signal events, 9000, 16900 for the eta and 63900, 183500 for the eta' channel, is the largest available to date. Following these studies, a preliminary measurement of the difference between D and D_s CP-asymmetries in the eta' channel was performed, for both 2011 and 2012 data-samples. The central value of this measurement is currently being kept ``blind" to avoid any experimenter bias until the final approval of all details of the measurement by the collaboration, but its resolution is already determined. The statistical accuracy of Delta A_(CP) is on the order of 10 ^- 2 and 10 ^- 3 for 2011 and 2012 data-samples, respectively. An upper bound to the systematics uncertainties was determined to be less than the statistical accuracy, on the order of few per mille. The accuracy of this measurement is limited by the D CP-asymmetry, since the statistics is lower compared to the D_s. We envision the accuracy over the CP-asymmetry measurement for the D_s sample to be a sensible improvement over the existing result. The next step in the analysis would be the measurement of CP-asymmetries difference between the D_s decay in the eta and eta' channels, which would allow to cancel the bias deriving from production-asymmetry effects. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that it is possible to reconstruct large and clean samples of charm decays into eta final states, and to measure CP-asymmetries in the D^+/D_s^+ -> eta^(') pi^+ channels at LHCb. The sample collected during LHCb-Run I already represents the largest sample of these reconstructed decays to date, yielding competitive measurement with respect to the existing results from B-factories. This analysis represents a valid starting-point for further accurate measurements of CP-violation and branching-fractions of these decay modes in a hadronic environment. A larger sample is expected from Run II, which includes dedicated trigger selections for the D/D_s^+ -> eta^(') h^+ channels, introduced as an outcome of this feasibility study...|$|E

This is largely because the signals generated by non- 1 ^H nuclei have limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the nuclei?s lower Larmor frequency and lower relative abundance. Exploiting the increased SNR provided by array coils is a natural direction to turn in addressing this; however, it is highly unusual for scanners to be equipped with multi-channel, multi-nuclear receivers due to cost and complexity. This leads to a ?chicken or the egg? conundrum where scanners are not equipped with second-nuclei receivers {{because of the lack}} of any current widespread clinical adoption of second-nuclei studies, but studies are rare because there are not readily available receivers.

(The juxtaglomerular cells can also release renin {{independently of the}} macula densa. They are also <b>triggered</b> by baroreceptors <b>lining</b> the arterioles, and release renin if a fall in blood pressure in the arterioles is detected. Furthermore, activation of the sympathetic nervous system stimulates renin release through activation of beta-1 receptors.) ...|$|R

[...] When Jordan responded yes to a question about whether he had had any surgeries in the prior 12 months, it <b>triggered</b> a <b>line</b> of questioning about his senior season meniscus surgery.

[...] After discovering a torn meniscus, he had a second knee surgery, which was successful. He attended every game that season in his family's season ticket section.|$|R
