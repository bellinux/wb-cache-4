5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} inside <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell, squeeze {{water out}} of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{returned}} to the United States via Diego Garcia, Australia, and Hawaii in early 1988. Several months later, Missouris crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included Vancouver and Victoria in Canada, San Diego, Seattle, and Bremerton.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros.

25|$|The coins {{differ in}} terms of size, weight and rim. Within each {{sequence}} the diameter and weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins increase with their value. The 50-øre and 10-krone coins have smooth <b>rims,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1- and 5-krone coins are milled. <b>The</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2- and 20-krone coins have interrupted milling. The 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins have a hole in <b>the</b> middle. Use <b>of</b> these various characteristics {{makes it easy for}} the blind and sight-impaired to tell the coins apart.|$|R

These birds inhabit arid regions from the Canary Islands along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sahara through the Middle East to Central Asia and Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea bed is apt to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the head}} extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum.

40|$|Background: During {{anterior}} cruciate ligament reconstruction, proper femoral tunnel placement is important. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{present study was to}} characterize <b>the</b> osseous anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral intercondylar notch. Methods: We studied <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral intercondylar notch in 200 human femora from skeletally ma-ture donors, with specific attention being paid to <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge on <b>the</b> lateral wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch and <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch. The distances from <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inter-condylar notch to the lateral intercondylar ridge and from <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch to <b>the</b> inlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch (notch depth) were measured at the nine, ten, and eleven o’clock positions for right knees and at the one, two and three o’clock positions for left knees. Results: The lateral intercondylar ridge was present in 194 femora and absent in six. The mean distance from <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch to the lateral intercondylar ridge was 9. 0, 11. 0, and 12. 7 mm at the nine, ten, and eleven o’clock positions in right knees and the one, two, and three o’clock positions in left knees, re-spectively. We observed three different types <b>of</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch. <b>The</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intercondylar notch was distinct in 183 of 200 specimens. A distinct, straight border (type 1) was seen in 175 femora (87. 5 %); a distinct, V-shaped border (type 2) was seen in eight (4 %); and an indistinct border (type 3) was seen in seventeen (8. 5 %) ...|$|R

Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E
5|$|The French Indian Ocean {{territories of}} Île de France and Île Bonaparte were heavily {{fortified}} island bases from which French frigates {{were able to}} launch raids against British trade routes across the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. In late 1808, a squadron of four frigates departed France for the region under Commodore Jacques Hamelin with orders to prey on the convoys of East Indiamen that regularly crossed the Indian Ocean. During the late spring of 1809, these frigates dispersed into the Bay of Bengal, attacking British shipping and coastal harbours around <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Indian Ocean. The Royal Navy was also preparing an operation in the region, a staggered campaign intended to blockade, isolate and subsequently capture both Île deFrance and Île Bonaparte, eliminating the final French territories and bases east of Africa.|$|E
