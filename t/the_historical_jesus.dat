5|$|Modern {{research}} on <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Jesus</b> has not {{led to a}} unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Jesus,</b> the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E
5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Jesus</b> bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Jesus</b> have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E

25|$|Some mythicists hold—in terms {{given by}} Robert M. Price—the Jesus agnosticism viewpoint, while others go further {{and hold the}} Jesus atheism viewpoint. Some {{scholars}} have {{made the case that}} there are a number of plausible Jesuses that could have existed, but that there can be no certainty as to which Jesus was <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Others have said that Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past. A number of writers adduce various arguments to show that Christianity has syncretistic or mythical roots. As such, <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Jesus</b> should not be regarded as the founder of the religion, even if he did exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{inscription}} “Judah son of Jesus” {{is ignored}} in the calculation.

25|$|Most modern theologians {{view the}} baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as a {{historical}} event to which {{a high degree of}} certainty can be assigned.

25|$|Jesus was {{apparently}} {{a follower of}} John, a populist and activist prophet who looked forward to divine deliverance of the Jewish homeland from the Romans.
