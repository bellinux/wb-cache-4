40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to develop the organisation’s undergraduate (UG) student research skills and maximise the productivity and outputs within the research group. Rationale: Productivity and research outputs {{are known to be}} directly proportional {{to the size of the}} research group. The development of both undergraduates research skills and group’s research performance is in line with <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> <b>vision</b> and mission statement. Change Process: HSE model was used; the stakeholders were involved at all the levels within the group, through all the stages of change. Evaluation: The objectives were evaluated by using qualitative comparison against the standards, whereas training was evaluated by the Kirkpatrick model and the project as a whole was evaluated by CIPP model. Results: Results showed that the UG students, with extended training period of 1. 5 weeks were able to successfully apply their training, and the data generated by the student under supervision and with minimal supervision was found to be robust. Thus this data would form part of the PhD thesis and culminate into a research paper, resulting in a quick research publication. The research group acknowledged the co-supervisory experience gained. Feedback from the students demonstrated that their research experience have resulted in nurturing skills such as innovative thinking which will contribute to their success as undergraduates, and will aid in their career development.

40|$|Armed forces has {{historically}} been, {{and is still}} today, an essential actor in peacekeeping. Armed forces provides peacekeeping missions with the aim to provide stability and security in war-torn areas. Despite the mission’s aim, sexual transgressions by soldiers have been reported. Victims of these transgressions have been both soldiers and locals from the areas where the soldiers were supposed to provide stability and security. As a consequence of these revelations, a debate arose concerning the suitability of using armed forces for peacekeeping missions. The debate {{has been dominated by}} feminist scholars, who questioned for whom security is provided, if it is provided by the armed forces. Feminist scholars have highlighted the traditional understanding of the armed forces as carriers of destructive masculinity norms. With a point of departure in this debate, this study seeks to examine and understand gendered norms within the Swedish Armed Forces with the aim to understand if the views of Swedish peacekeepers gender relations and equality is compatible with keeping peace. This study is conducted as a single case study, based on semi-structured interviews. The central findings of this research concern the Swedish Armed Forces’ views and strategy on gender equality and how the male and female soldiers perceive and have experienced gender relations and equality. Lastly this research identifies some challenges for the work with gender equality within the Swedish Armed Forces. The study concludes that the Swedish Armed Forces work towards gender equality through gender neutrality. Even if there has been major work put into the area of equality, there is still evidence of gender-based discrimination and views upon gender relations and equality which does not correlate with <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> <b>vision</b> of an equal organisation...|$|R

40|$|Many organisations are {{continuously}} {{searching for}} methods {{which can be}} used to improve performance. The balanced scorecard is a management system that enables organisations to clarify their vision and strategy and translate them into action. When fully deployed, the balanced scorecard transforms strategic planning from an academic exercise into the nerve centre of an enterprise. A prerequisite for implementing a balanced scorecard is a clear understanding of <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> <b>vision</b> and strategy. <b>The</b> basis for the vision and the strategy should be the holistic view and the information management receives during systematic strategy work. The research study addresses the integration of South African Airways (SAA) strategy with the performance management system. A comprehensive literature study was performed on performance management and the balanced scorecard. Questionnaires, developed from the literature study, were distributed amongst randomly selected respondents, in order to establish the extent to which South African Airways manages performance. The opinions of the various respondents were compared with the guidelines provided by the literature study in order to identify the best approach of performance measurement to be implemented at South African Airways. The final step of this study entailed the formulation of recommendations. These recommendations are regarded as critical to ensure the successful implementation of a performance management system at South African Airways. The following main recommendations were made: Although the empirical study revealed that South African Airways shares its strategic objectives with its management, it is highly recommended that a balanced scorecard should be used as a measuring approach for performance at South African Airways; Before any organisation can start implementing a balanced scorecard it needs a clear understanding of its vision and strategy. It is the management’s responsibility to define a vision, formulate a strategy and set strategic goals regardless of a balanced scorecard being implemented; The implementation of a balanced scorecard should always be organised as a separate project. Several different procedures describing the building process of a balanced scorecard have been presented. The research shows that, to increase the chance of a successful scorecard implementation, regular feedback must be provided to all employees and managers must hold people accountable for using the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{distinction}} between management style and leadership style {{has been confirmed}} in this research by examining the working relationships between leaders and followers in 6 separate sites of a computer systems <b>organisation.</b> <b>The</b> relationships between 4 areas of organisational outcome, (performance/effectiveness, job satisfaction, anxiety, and depression) and {{the perceptions of the}} leadership styles of the follower's most significant manager and the organisational environments of culture and climate were studied. A systemic model of these relationships has been constructed and elaborated. From a follower perspective, 4 distinct leadership factors are articulated. One factor is concerned with the future of <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> (<b>Visioning)</b> while another factor is concerned with managing within <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> (Organising & Resourcing). The results highlight the weak conceptual and structural distinctions between the facets of Transformational Leadership and Transactional Leadership in the literature. e. g. Bass, Avolio & Jung (1995) and thus support Kotter (1982, 1990, 2001) and House & Shamir (1993). The leadership factors of managers deemed to be "most significant" and the organisational environment are related. In particular, the factor of Organising & Resourcing is related to Teamwork in the organisational environment while the leadership factor of Visioning is related to the organisational culture in terms of the variables of Mission, and Communication, and the organisational climate variables of Work Goals, Work Demands, and Work Supports. These results support the views that one of the main purposes of leadership leadership is to form and maintain <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> culture. (Bennis, 1989; Bennis & Nanus, 1985; and Schein, 1985, 1990, 1997). Also, significant managers with the style called People Orientation have a direct impact on the well-being of their subordinates. In particular, People Orientation is negatively related to anxiety and depression, while organisational culture, via the variable of Mission is also negatively related to anxiety, and Teamwork, and Mission are both negatively related to depression. The results imply that solutions to stress that do not address the leader/follower relationship and neglect the need for a mission and teamwork ethos in <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> culture are misdirected and prone to failure. The results further show that leadership style is not related to the follower's cognitive style (adaption or innovation) on the KAI. Cognitive style is however related to Work Demands, thus it appears that follower's construe the tasks and problems in line with their cognitive preferences confirming that the KAI is heavily associated with ideation. The practical implications are: 1) Followers see a distinct difference between the visionary elements of leadership and the organising and resourcing components of management. Followers also identify a process of communication that is common to both management and leadership as well another important factor labeled People Orientation. 2) Managers with this style of people orientation have a direct link to the feelings and well-being of followers as measured by anxiety. Increases in the style of People Orientation are likely to be linked to reduced state anxiety and reduced depression in followers. Individual performance/effectiveness is largely accounted for by Work Goals with the moderating effect of the combination of KAI and teamwork rather than the direct impact of management. 3) Followers in this research seem to be in a developmental dilemma where their need for support and encouragement from management can inhibit them from solving problems in line with their preferred cognitive styles. In such circumstances, behavioural outcomes may be different from the norm and thus paradigm breaking for both the relationship with the manager, and with <b>the</b> <b>organisation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Communication is {{strategic}} when it {{is completely}} consistent with <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> mission, <b>vision,</b> values and {{when it is}} able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness between their competitors. It is important to understand the concept of communication strategy, it should be seen from the organization’s perspective and no one else beside them. As a result of this communication, strategic communication should follow ‘The nature of organisational communication in general, and strategic communication in particular, is defined as the purposeful use of communication by an organisation to fulfill its mission’ stated by (Hallahan et al., 2007). Therefore, the Strategic Communications Framework should be lay out to aim the objectives of communicating to the audience/organisation. The deliberate application of the specific content will help achieve the business goal clearly. While communication is something that does happen in <b>the</b> <b>organisation,</b> businesses that take steps to implement sound strategies impacting the effectiveness of their business communications can achieve measurable results. According to Mulhern(2009), Technological advancement have been a huge factor in business meaning that information can be communicated through many diverse channels and media like the internet and through ads. Technology have been rapidly growing throughout the year pretty fast, accelerating communication that allow customers to connect and communicate with others. This {{will make it easier for}} them to reach to each other in a traditional communication way that suit the demand of their needs. ‘These changes mean that marketers are in a far more challenging competitive environment in attempting to fulfil customers wants and needs, while simultaneously seeking to develop long-term relationships’( [...] Mulhern, 2009). Having changes in communication will help communication goals, organisation, and communication channels. This will have an effect of measuring the effectiveness of the communication tactics used in a business for their audience. To start a business no matter how small it is, communication strategy should be a goal to start with and it will indicate the future of the business. A business that communicate with their employees about benefit options will have increased the level of trust between them.|$|R
