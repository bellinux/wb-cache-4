5|$|The 1894 Championship {{began with}} a loss for the {{defending}} champions against England, during {{a game in which}} Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it would get to the backs quickly and allow them to run at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.|$|E
5|$|The group {{started work}} on the album in 1972, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> up Tommy and Who's Next, which had both {{achieved}} substantial critical and commercial success. Recording was delayed while bassist John Entwistle and singer Roger Daltrey recorded solo albums and drummer Keith Moon worked on films. Because a new studio was not finished in time, the group had to use Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio. As well as the group's typical playing styles, especially from Moon, the album makes significant use of Townshend's multi-tracked synthesizers and sound effects, and Entwistle's layered horn parts. Relationships between the group and manager Kit Lambert broke down irretrievably during recording and {{he had left the}} band's services by the time the album was released.|$|E

25|$|Hill passed Barrichello {{for third}} and this became second when Alesi's engine failed {{on the next}} lap. Soon Häkkinen passed Irvine but Coulthard dropped back while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> him through. Barrichello was passed by Verstappen and then Häkkinen {{attacked}} him. Barrichello cracked under the pressure and spun off on lap 20 into the wall, ending his race. On the next lap, Schumacher had a 360 degree spin at Pouhon, and his lead was significantly reduced when he rejoined. He kept a five-second lead during the stops in which Häkkinen got ahead of Verstappen.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes {{are often}} broadly {{classified}} as {{high on the}} glycemic index (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> a low-GI diet. The GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending on type (such as red, russet, white, or King Edward), origin, preparation methods (by cooking method, whether it is eaten hot or cold, whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole), and with what it is consumed (addition of various high-fat or high-protein toppings). Consuming reheated or cooled potatoes that were previously cooked may afford a lower GI effect.|$|E

25|$|While Livingstone had a {{great impact}} on British Imperialism, he did so at a {{tremendous}} cost to his family. In his absences, his children grew up missing their father, and his wife Mary (daughter of Mary and Robert Moffat), whom he wed in 1845, endured very poor health, and died of malaria on 27 April 1862 <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> him in Africa. He had six children: Robert reportedly died in the American Civil War; Agnes (b. 1847), Thomas, Elizabeth (who died at two months), William Oswell (nicknamed Zouga because of the river along which he was born, in 1851) and Anna Mary (b. 1858). Only Agnes, William Oswell and Anna Mary married and had children. His one regret in later life was that he did not spend enough time with his children.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when he gets to the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake like someone <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> Napoleon's last orders, Junot {{dispatched}} General of Brigade Jean-Jacques Avril and 3,000 troops toward Badajoz. Avril {{reached the}} frontier {{to find his}} force faced by a body of artillery-armed Spanish militia behind the Guadiana River. Hearing that Dupont never got beyond Córdoba and that Badajoz was held large numbers of Spanish troops, the French general backtracked to Estremoz in Alentejo Province. On 12 June, General of Division Louis Henri Loison marched east from Almeida in Beira Province with a brigade. He cleared the Spanish garrison from Fort Concepcion and reached the environs of Ciudad Rodrigo. At this time he received intelligence that the city held a considerable garrison, Spain was in revolt, and Bessières was far away. Returning to Almeida on the 15th, he heard that Porto was teetering {{on the edge of}} rebellion. Taking 2,000 men and a few cannons, he set out for Porto but on 21 June stumbled into a hornet's nest of guerillas who sniped at him and rolled boulders down from the heights. Loison decided that his small force was overmatched and withdrew to Almeida.|$|E

[...] Musicologist Walter Everett identifies the use of VII — IV in the chorus to suggest a chromaticized major key with minor pentatonic inflections. The refrain alternates between the I and ii7 without ever meeting the expected V. During this, {{the relationship between the}} music and text is reflected in the lyric [...] "I wish they all could be California girls", which is also never fulfilled to the narrator.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{is often}} {{credited}} as {{the creator of}} Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style {{are considered to be}} {{a major part of the}} New Journalism literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the first person, while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color [...] "the story" [...] he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b> His writing aimed to be humorous, colorful and bizarre, and he often exaggerated events to be more entertaining. The term Gonzo has since been applied in kind to numerous other forms of highly subjective artistic expression.|$|E

Behind, Hesjedal attacked once again, and was not chased down; eventually gaining thirteen seconds on Rodríguez, reducing the latter's advantage to 17 seconds ahead of the final two stages of the race. [...] Scarponi, who finished fourth on the stage behind Rodríguez, moved into third place overall; a 20-second margin over Basso on the stage swung third place in the defending champion's favour by six seconds. Both Rodríguez and Basso felt that the Giro title was Hesjedal's to lose, due to the final stage time trial.|$|E

2500|$|The close {{relation}} between the papacy and the branch declined over the years, with the decline especially pronounced after 1464, with few to no branch managers being selected to be the [...] "depositary-general", the official who was essentially the fiscal agent for the Apostolic Chamber, or the Church's treasury. Pope Sixtus IV would repudiate the Medici's control of the alum trade and also his debts to them, as well as seizing Medici property in Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478. The Pazzi's interlocked businesses and banks had captured the alum business after the Medici were removed from it, and were supplying the depositary-general from their ranks, indicating that they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the Medici route of initially building up their empire through papal custom. The papacy would eventually agree to repay the debts, but did so extremely slowly; so slowly that the branch manager Giovanni Tornabouni agreed to take stocks of alum instead, despite the depressed market for alum. Tornabuoni would still be in charge when 1494 came and the edifice of the Medici came crashing down. Because the branch had been doing so poorly, it owed more than it was due, so the Roman government was satisfied to allow Tornabouni to assume {{the rest of the}} partnership's equity and debts.|$|E
2500|$|Describing {{the show}} as {{simultaneously}} [...] "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick" [...] and calling Knowles [...] "the planet's greatest superstar", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the Sasha Fierce disc of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine praised the show, saying, [...] "She worked, and worked it relentlessly, never missing a note, a beat of choreography, or a chance to strike a pose, hold it, and be adored." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented [...] "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage {{to the center of}} the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again." [...] A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles [...] "brought all the fierceness" [...] on stage for the tour. The Australians Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in [...] "full view" [...] further praising the [...] "carefully" [...] choreographed show. Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, [...] " [...] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves...no one, not Britney, not Ciara and not Rihanna can offer what she does—a complete package of voice, moves and presence." [...] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail awarded the performance five out of five stars and noted that Knowles' vocal abilities were showcased during the ballads of the show where she was [...] "note perfect throughout". She concluded her review by saying that although it was [...] "too early" [...] to compare Knowles with Michael Jackson, [...] "she certainly proved that she is one of the most exciting and talented performers around and may well go down in history as such." [...] Comparing her with Diana Ross and Tina Turner, Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that Knowles proved she was the [...] "world's best female performed" [...] with her performance and added, [...] "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever... Good luck <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> that act whoever you are." [...] Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as [...] "powerhouse" [...] and added, [...] "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott. Sometimes her booming vocals were so over the top she seemed to have come down with a case of Mariah Carey syndrome." [...] Writing that there were [...] "ska, reggae, girlish pop, jazz, rap, soul, gospel, Middle Eastern, rock and body-thumping club remixes", Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times added, [...] "The only thing is, while she can wrap her voice and body around just about any style, she doesn't really have her own signature, at least musically. And while all the variety kept the concert interesting, it came off a little unfocused... But for a show that's as much about style as music, you gotta hand it to Beyoncé. The evening played out like a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, [...] "she is a performer who can shape-change at will. Whether charismatic and soulful, or teasing and flirty, Beyoncé is, above all, in charge. Probably the most 'in charge' of any female artist I've seen onstage... she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years." [...] However, she noted that Knowles is [...] "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical."
