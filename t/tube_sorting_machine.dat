40|$|In this research, {{the basic}} {{physical}} characteristics of garlic bulbs were first investigated. The results studied showed that the shape size and weight of garlic bulbs held with high correlation. Accordingly, one type of shape sorting mechanism as the stage <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> and two types of weight sorting mechanism as the single-rail and double-rail <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> were designed and developed {{for the use of}} garlic bulbs grading. The accuracies of grading obtained for single-rail and double-rail weight <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> were 90. 56 and 76. 11 %, respectively, and under the tests with three different stem lengths of the garlic bulbs and five rotation speeds of the hairbrush shafts for the stage <b>sorting</b> <b>machine,</b> the maximum accuracy obtained was 90. 1 % with the case of stem length 3 cm and rotation speed 86 rpm. The processing capacity of the stage <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> was reached up to about 576 kg/hr which was 2. 2 and 1. 4 times, respectively as compared to the results obtained by the single-rail and double-rail weight <b>sorting</b> <b>machine.</b> A sequential operation system for the automatic garlic bulbs grading was also developed and which was combined together with the parts of the automatic supplying unit, the peel and dust removing equipment, and the stage <b>sorting</b> <b>machine.</b> The severity of clearing, peel stripping and injury of the graded garlic bulbs were judged and evaluated as treated by this newly developed system. The results showed that treated with or without peel and dust removing equipment had the significant difference in cleaning and peel stripping, but the injury rate of the system was only 4 % Moreover, studies of the cost-benefit assessment of various <b>sorting</b> <b>machines</b> showed that the stage <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> also held the lower construction expenditure and operation cost than those obtained by the single-rail and double-rail weight <b>sorting</b> <b>machines,</b> and the operation costs per kilogram of garlic bulbs graded was NT$ 0. 47, 0. 81 and 1. 28, respectively for the stage, double-rail and single-rail <b>sorting</b> <b>machines.</b> Use of this newly developed stage <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> could precisely and quickly grade garlic bulbs, and could save tremendous labor power and processing cost as required in the grading operation of garlic bulbs. 本研究蒜球基礎物性探討，結果顯示蒜球外形與重量具有高度相關性，故分別設計一套以外形為選別機制之階級式分級機，及以重量為選別機制之單、雙排重量式分級機進行分級測試。單、雙排重量式分級機測試結果，獲致其分級準確率分別為 90. 56 與 76. 11 %，而階級式分級機，當蒜球莖長 3 cm. 分級轉速 86 rpm時，分級準確率達 90. 1 %，分級作業量最高可達 576 kg/hr，為單排（側放式）重量式分級機之 2. 22 倍，雙排（下放式）重量式分級機之 1. 41 倍。本研究亦測試包含自動供料機構、去皮脫膜機構及階級式蒜球分級機所組裝成之一貫化作業蒜球分級系統之清潔、脫膜去皮及損傷程度，結果顯示經脫膜去皮機構清潔之蒜球，與未經刷洗清潔之蒜球於清潔度與脫膜去皮皆有明顯之差異，而其損傷率也僅為 4 %；且有關外形與重量三種型式分級機之分級成本效益評估結果，獲致階級式分級機分級成本，每公斤約 0. 47 元為最佳，其次雙排下放式每公斤約 0. 81 元，單排側放式則為最差每公斤約達 1. 28 元，顯示階級式分級機具有蒜球分級準確、快速，亦可達到節省人力與成本之效果...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} we have {{considered}} the self-balanced potato <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> differing from existing designs of self-balanced potato <b>sorting</b> <b>machines</b> with an oscillatory electric drive. That drive uses a linear induction motor. As the counterbalancing device, the method of the duplicating mechanism is applied. The duplicating mechanism is a specular reflection of the main working body, and also participates in technological process. Its application in the drive of machine allows not only to increase efficiency of cleaning, drying and sorting of potatoes, but also to increase reliability of sorting installation that corresponds to the newest tendencies of development of technology. We have brought the mathematical model of the offered electric drive of potato <b>sorting</b> <b>machine,</b> which is implemented in the environment of object and visual modeling of Matlab |Simulink|. The mathematical model allows investigating influence of parameters of the linear induction electric drive on parameters of oscillatory process of working body in dynamics.

50|$|Ten {{years after}} Crosfield's {{frustrated}} attempt {{to design a}} cheque <b>sorting</b> <b>machine,</b> the Scottish banks came to Crosfield {{and asked him to}} build a banknote <b>sorting</b> <b>machine.</b> The American equipment then used for cheque sorting could not handle the soft, light paper of used, sometimes sticky banknotes. In 1959, Crosfield set up a team of engineers at Fortress Road, London, and in 1964 they produced the first banknote <b>sorting</b> <b>machines</b> for the Scottish banks. He used optical character recognition and a new patented process for handling small, flimsy pieces of paper, called the 'Double curvature sheet feeder'. The banknote sorter was followed by <b>machines</b> for <b>sorting</b> and reading luncheon vouchers, postal orders and lottery tickets and for counting and dispensing banknotes. In 1966 Crosfield spun this new division off as Crosfield Business Machines, with its own management, offices, production and research in Watford. New equipment, built first for Nord West Lotto in Germany, coupled to small computers automatically printed out a list of prize winners and the weekly profit and tax liability for the lottery. Simultaneously a high-speed camera made a microfilm of the coupons as a security check. A few machines replaced hundreds of production staff. Another development, a <b>sorting</b> <b>machine</b> and 'garbler', first installed for the Dutch Central Bank, sorted good used banknotes from bad and bundled the good while shredding the bad, a task that formerly required a staff of thousands.|$|R
