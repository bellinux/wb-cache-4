5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>On</b> 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California. He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>On</b> 21 January 2001, Laurie {{announced that he had}} paid McCaw an undisclosed amount {{to walk away from the}} deal.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>On</b> this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E
5|$|The union between Norway and Sweden, {{imposed by}} the Great Powers in 1814, had been under {{considerable}} strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own consular service. Nansen, although not by inclination a politician, had spoken out on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> several occasions in defence of Norway's interests. It seemed, early in the 20th century that agreement {{between the two countries}} might be possible, but hopes were dashed when negotiations broke down in February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by Christian Michelsen, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{to amend}} the Official Languages Act {{according}} to Shastri's assurances given in February 1965 faced stiff resistance from the pro-Hindi lobby. On 16 February 55 MPs from 8 different states publicly expressed their disapproval of {{any change in the}} Language policy. On 19 February 19 MPs from Maharashtra and Gujarat voiced their opposition for change and on 25 February 106 Congress MPs met the Prime Minister to request him not {{to amend the}} Act. However, Congress MPs from Madras did not debate <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> the Parliament floor but met the Prime Minister on 12 March. Congress and opposition parties hesitated to debate the issue in Parliament as they did not wish to make their bitter divisions in public. On 22 February at a meeting in Congress Working Committee, K. Kamaraj pressed for the amendment to Official Languages Act, but received instant opposition from Morarji Desai, Jagjivan Ram and Ram Subhag. The Congress working committee finally agreed to a resolution which amounted to slowing down of Hindi-isation, strong implementation of the three language formula in Hindi and non-Hindi speaking states, and conduct of the public services exam in all regional languages. These decisions were agreed upon during the Chief Ministers' meeting which was held on 24 February.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977. Producer Michael Deeley {{became interested in}} Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13million to $15million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie). Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained {{the rights to the}} titles. Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.|$|E

His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>on</b> the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to suggest this to Leo he is told that the issue will have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before they could even begin. Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work. Josh had failed to even notice until Donna voices her concern as she tries, unsuccessfully, to get a hold of Ryan.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>On</b> other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E
