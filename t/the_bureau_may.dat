Bureau of Reclamation {{operates}} hundreds of dams in seventeen western states, and storage and release of water at these dams often causes serious environmental impacts. In operating these dams, however, the Bureau has largely been excused from complying with the environmental review requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. This article explains and analyzes relevant NEPA cases involving these Bureau projects, and argues that <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>may</b> want to conduct NEPA reviews for project operations even if they are not legally required. It also describes and critiques District Judge Oliver Wanger’s recent decisions applying NEPA to the Bureau’s efforts to comply with the Endangered Species Act in operating the Central Valley Project.

40|$|At the United States Census Bureau {{virtually}} all census data are geographically referenced. As a result providing maps for conducting censuses and surveys and for disseminating the results {{is one of}} the major functions of the Census Bureau. This paper will detail the history of cartographic developments at the Census Bureau as well as examine where <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>may</b> be heading in the coming years. Beginning in 1854, the Census Bureau began its illustrious career in cartography. Through the 19 th, 20 th, and into the 21 st century, mapmaking at the Census Bureau has taken on different forms. As technology has evolved so has the cartographic response. From the innovative statistical atlases of the late 1800 ’s to the present, the quality and effectiveness of census cartography has grown. Having a rich national spatial data source in the TIGER file for the 1990, 2000, and 2010 censuses allowed the Census Bureau to leap into new and varied cartographic products to meet specific operational needs. Through time, the concept of a map has changed from a graphic representation of features presented in familiar paper format to maps that exist but are only viewed in a virtual state. More importantly, recent technology offers new opportunities for cartography such as viewing maps on mobile computing devices and increased precision of map data through global positioning systems (GPS) and improved remote sensing capabilities. In the past, even with automated mapping techniques, the final product was a paper map in the hands of the user. One of the challenges for census cartographers concerns a change from a “real ” mapping operation to a “virtual ” mapping environment. Where will U. S. census cartography be in 2020 ? 1...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether the}} Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director’s appointment of <b>the</b> <b>Bureau’s</b> Deputy Director comports with the Appointments Clause. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> in July 2010, {{as well as}} the offices of <b>the</b> <b>Bureau’s</b> Director and Deputy Director, to coordinate the regulation and enforcement of federal consumer-financial-protection laws. Under that act, the Director appoints the Deputy Director. The Appointments Clause permits “Heads of Departments” to appoint inferior officers like the Deputy Director. But it is unclear if <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> is a “department” and thus if the Director is a department head who can appoint the Deputy Director. Although I argue that <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> should be deemed a department, I explain why the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board and prior Appointments Clause jurisprudence suggest otherwise. Indeed, this article provides one of the first analyses and applications of the new definition of “department” announced in Free Enterprise Fund. An inferior officer’s appointment (that of a deputy, no less) may seem inconsequential. But an invalid appointment could, depending on the Deputy Director’s duties, lead to unnecessary, time-consuming litigation and perhaps even the invalidation of agency actions for <b>the</b> newly established <b>Bureau</b> in its formative years. If so, <b>the</b> <b>Bureau’s</b> opponents <b>may</b> have an additional, yet until now unnoticed, means of disrupting <b>the</b> new <b>Bureau.</b> Congress should, without delay, remedy the Deputy Director’s potentially improper appointment...|$|R

Under {{the influence of the}} differentiated authorities and intra-group comparison mechanism, in order to compete for the party and government’s attention, <b>the</b> functional <b>bureau</b> <b>may</b> create one institutional innovation after another, thus forming institutional innovation overflowing. For example, <b>the</b> agriculture <b>bureau</b> wants to have some institutional innovation to demonstrate that China’s agricultural foundation is weak and could endanger national food security so that the party committee will give more weight to agricultural work. <b>The</b> land <b>bureau</b> also appeals to the party committee by means of institutional innovations to stress that if the party committee does not pay attention to land affairs, it will be difficult for the local government and functional bureau to strictly adhere to the bottom line of arable land of 1.8 billion mu (about 300 million acres). In the early case study, <b>the</b> family planning <b>bureau</b> also sent a signal to the party committee that if population growth was not strictly controlled, it would lead to a baby boom, so family planning bureau must be focused on.
