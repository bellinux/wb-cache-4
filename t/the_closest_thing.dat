5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. <b>The</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the party's independent, [...] "national communist" [...] course, the {{absolute}} control that Ceaușescu {{had over the}} party and the country led to some non-Romanian observers describing the PCR as one of <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> to an old-style Stalinist party. [...] For instance, Encyclopædia Britannica referred to the last 18 years of Ceaușescu's tenure as a period of [...] "neo-Stalinism," [...] and the last edition of the Country Study on Romania referred to the PCR's [...] "Stalinist repression of individual liberties." ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the Communist Party—and indeed, nearly all other {{institutions}} in Romania—had become completely subordinated to Ceaușescu's will. This was {{in contrast to}} the situation in other Communist countries. Most ruling Communist Party leaders were merely first among equals, even with the great power that came with their posts. Although Ceaușescu was a national Communist, his absolute control over the country and the pervasiveness of the cult led several non-Romanian observers to describe his regime as one of <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> to an old-style Stalinist regime.|$|R

25|$|Since Simpson's 1945 classification, the paleontological {{record has}} been recalibrated, and the {{intervening}} years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics.

They have been to every NCAA Tournament since 1999, {{a year in which}} they made a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight, and have appeared in every final AP poll since the 2008-09 season. They have also appeared in all but one WCC conference title game since 1995, and in every conference title game since 1998, winning 16 of them.

50|$|Dooper is a stray {{cat that}} lives in a {{cardboard}} box in an alley near Louise's apartment. He is afraid of almost everything and is quite nervous. As a result of this he is constantly coming up with outlandish conspiracy theories and rushes to warn everyone. <b>The</b> <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> to friends he has are Buckley and Eddie, whom he normally tells his theories to first. They usually ignore him, but sometimes use his conspiracy theories to trick him into doing their dirty work. He will often find small, everyday things like a crack in the pavement and use it as proof of his theories. Also it is said that Dooper doesn't have any testicles, suggesting that he once had an owner who had him neutered. Voiced by Emo Philips.|$|R

One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was {{beyond the reach of}} army justice because he'd already resigned his commission. <b>The</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations.|$|E

For the show's sake, for the people on it, and for the audience that has devoted 11 years to it, the Winchesters have to change. Or else all these bodies, and all this blood, and all of those broken homes mean nothing.

5000|$|After going 11-2 {{and winning}} the Mountain West title again in 2011, the Horned Frogs played Louisiana Tech in the Poinsettia Bowl. TCU won 31-24 in a {{somewhat}} lackluster performance after narrowly (and somewhat controversially) missing their third BCS Bowl bid in a row. TCU finished 16th in the final BCS rankings, two slots below the cutoff for a non-AQ team to get a BCS bid. The win allowed Patterson to tie Meyer as the winningest coach in TCU history. On October 10, 2011, the TCU Board of Trustees approved an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference, and entered that conference on July 1, 2012. The move to the Big 12 was a return [...] "home" [...] in a sense for the Horned Frogs, as they renewed many of their in-state rivalries from the old Southwest Conference. Before the move to the Big 12, the Horned Frogs had been reckoned as one of <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> to a major football power in a mid-major conference.|$|R
25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. <b>The</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred {{to the amount of}} land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E

Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions {{thanks in part to the}} limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{a source}} is {{regarded}} as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon {{the present state of}} knowledge within the field.

50|$|Rune-keepers are <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> to magic-users {{offered in}} The Lord of the Rings Online, but they aren't magicians in the {{traditional}} sense. Their new Attunement mechanic is represented by a bar with a sliding scale to illustrate whether they're attuned to dealing damage or healing wounds. As a Rune-keeper uses either healing or damaging abilities, the scale slides towards {{either end of the}} bar and the Rune-keeper's proficiency in either focus increases. As the Rune-keeper increases focus towards one end of the scale, more of those skills become available in greater power. However, the Rune-keeper will then also lose focus {{on the other end of}} the scale, making the skills associated with the opposite end unavailable. Therefore, the Rune-keeper can only effectively maneuver either their healing or damage abilities, but not both. Switching between proficiencies requires time. This release of this class was very controversial, as Turbine claims to have no use of magic in the Lord of the Rings world, as, in the lore, magic was restricted to the Ainur.|$|R

25|$|Schopenhauer {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met {{during the winter of}} 1813–1814 in Weimar at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of Herder, and an early Indologist. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in Dresden. This was through his neighbor of two years, Karl Christian Friedrich Krause. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered Sanskrit, unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned meditation and received <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to expert advice concerning Indian thought.|$|E
25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a monograph are chapters {{dedicated to}} his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they {{paint a picture of}} a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The Red Party was {{established}} by a merger of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party in 2007. Torstein Dahle, {{the leader of the}} Red Electoral Alliance, was elected party leader. In the 2007 county election, Red received 1.9% of the vote, increasing its share by 1.6%. In an opinion poll conducted by TNS Gallup for TV2 in late August 2009, the party received 2.7% of the popular vote, an increase of 0.7%. Such a result in the election would mean that the party would have two parliamentary representatives, one from Oslo and one from Hordaland. In total, 12 opinion polls claimed that Red would win two seats in parliament. On seeing these poll results, Dahle said he would support the Red-Green Coalition, acknowledging that he couldn't topple <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to socialism to the right of Red. On 11 September, three days before election day, Jens Stoltenberg told the media that he didn't want the Red-Green Coalition to become dependent on Red in Parliament. Earlier, Ola Borten Moe from the Centre Party told Klassekampen that neither he nor his party would collaborate or affiliate themselves with Red.|$|E
