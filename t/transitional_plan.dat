The eligibility list for screening and tracking of infants at risk developmentally also includes children with: • Birth weight under 1500 grams • Received care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) • Born to a chemically-dependent mother If you have never seen a Level III neonatal intensive care unit, plan to visit one before you begin your coalition building. Set up a meeting with the neonatal department head and tell them about your coalition plans and solicit their support. Tour the NICU and meet with the NICU staff and the families who are currently there.

40|$|As {{a measure}} to {{mitigate}} global warming through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, there is broad agreement that the Danish energy system must undergo a process of transition towards a renewable energy supply. To support this transition, {{a proposal for a}} strategic energy planning has been presented by the Danish Energy Authority (DEA) and Local Government Denmark (LGDK). It is a planning tool facilitating local planning towards a more flexible and efficient energy system. The concept {{is in the process of}} being developed and this thesis aims at contributing to this development. The thesis strives to provide this through a comprehensive case study using the Region of Zealand as it’s base. By asking: Which possibilities and challenges exist for a strategically long-term transition of the energy system in the Region of Zealand to a renewable energy supply, and what elements are thereby derived for the development of strategic energy planning? Two separate but interacting objectives are proposed for the study: 1) The development of a strategic and long-term transition plan for the Region of Zealand and 2) consequently deriving the challenges and possibilities for a strategic energy planning in order to contribute towards further development and refinement of the concept. The study starts by a theoretical discussion and methodological operationalization of the concept, followed by four separate analyses. First a discussion of the transitional goal, secondly by a mapping of the initial energy system, production, consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Thirdly a review of the main transition conditions: the potential for energy savings and renewable energy production is being performed, and finally the energy transition analysis outlines the way for the regional energy system, towards a renewable energy supply in 2050. The thesis results in a proposed energy balance for the Region of Zealand in 2050 as well as an associated system transition plan. Through the elaboration of this <b>transitional</b> <b>plan,</b> a methodology for strategic and systemic energy planning has been developed, which facilitates robust, long-term action plans. This approach is further condensed, alongside the other experiences derived from the case study, in order to summarize the recommendations, which this study can pass on to the planning process towards the future sustainable energy systems...|$|E
40|$|THE SECOND REPUBLIC OF LEBANON: FROM CONFESSIONALISM TO MAJORITARIANISM? A {{study of}} Inter-Commmunal Relations in the Lebanese post-war {{political}} system In the early 1990 s, the 15 year-long civil-war in Lebanon {{finally came to}} an end. This was due to a compromise in 1989 between Muslims and Christians, instituted in The National Accord, or the Taif Agreement. The last national compromise between Muslims and Christians was the National Pact from 1943. In the new agreement, important institutional reforms, regarding the relationship between Muslims and Christians, were stipulated. The changes proposed in Taif were officially written into the new Lebanese Constitution in August and September 1990. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the impact of the adoptation of the 1989 Taif Agreement and the 1990 Constitution. The statement of the problem was formulated as two questions; 1. To what extent does the adoptation of the Taif Agreement and the 1990 Constitution represent a change in the balance of power between the religious communities? 2. To what extent do these institutional changes lay down new normative principles for power-distribution in Lebanon? According to Lijphart and other consociationalists, Lebanon has been an example of a consociational political system. Until the civil-war, the confessional political structure in Lebanon came close to a consociational arrangement. A coalition of elites representing the various major communities, governed the country on a joint basis. Within this power-sharing system parliamentary seats were proportionally distributed among the communities according to their numerical strength. Ever since the creation of modern Lebanon in 1920, the principle of proportionality has been subject of a significant inter-communal discourse. The distribution of the institutional positions and other power resources has not been adjusted according to the demographic changes. The last census, conducted in 1932, has been the basis for institutional apportionment. The rigid political system constituted a major problem for the inter-communal political relationship. The 1943 pact described a formula for parliamentary representation based on a ratio of 6 : 5. At that time, since the Christians were in majority, governmental positions, both seats in the parliament as well as the presidential position, were in their favour. As it was obvious that the Muslims had bypassed the Christians in numerical strength, the inter-communal discourse regarding fair and suitable institutional arrangements intensified. Many authors considered the inter-communal tensions regarding the political system a main cause of the civil-war. In this study, I have treated the civil-war as a catalyst for the transformative relationship between the state and society (-ies) in the post-war period. The war, not only revealed the inter-communal debate of what constituted a fair power-distribution system, it also intensified this question. A problem in Lebanon is that, what one community sees as a fair system of power-distribution, another community sees as a system of ethnic dominance. The war revealed that Muslims in general, and the Shi ites in particular, were not satisfied with the 1943 confessional system. This, along with the changes in demographics, had to be dealt with constitutionally. Thus, the Taif Agreement, through the institutional reforms, established an institutional reconciliation between Muslims and Christians. The core of this study is an analysis of the implications of these constitutional reforms. The most important institutional change is the new formula for power-distribution. The old formula of 6 Christians to 5 Muslims (6 : 5), was replaced with a formula of a 50 : 50 ratio, stipulating the equality between Muslims and Christians. Another major change was the transferring of executive powers from the Maronite President (Christian) to the Sunni Prime Minister (Muslim) and the Council of Ministers, which made the political system a more collegial system, compared to the pre-war Presidential system. These institutional reforms can be seen as moderate changes in the power-distribution between Muslims and Christians. On the one hand, the weakening of the institutional-political power, as well as the increasing Syrian influence in post-war Lebanon, have made the Christians fear a system of Muslim domination. On the other hand, despite the fact that the Taif Agreement has increased the Muslim influence through the new formula, many Muslims, and the Shi ites in particular do not feel that the new pact reflects their status as the numerical strongest group. A system, which bases its power-distribution mechanisms on the numerical status of the communities, has to adapt to changes in the socio-cultural environment, otherwise the potential for conflicts will be substantial. Hence, the new Taif order lacks legitimacy. This can further be demonstrated through the Muslims demands for an alternative model of democracy, a majoritarian system. A majoritarian model is by many Muslims considered the only democratic model. The fact that the Muslims constitute the majority in Lebanon today, can explain their demand for a system reflecting their numerical strength. The Taif Agreement, while restating the 1943 system of confessional power-sharing, is also signalling a different system of power-distribution in the future. According to a <b>transitional</b> <b>plan,</b> confessionalism will be abolished in the future, confessional criteria in the civil service as well as at the governmental level. At the same time, Taif stipulates an electoral system free from any communal references. Such a system will clearly break with the confessional power-sharing system. The, above mentioned, principles have made the Christians fear the future political situation, and many have chosen to leave the country, further harming their demographic situation. Also, the Muslims claim for political secularism and a majoritarian system, is by many Christians seen as a first step towards an Islamic state. In order to ensure representation by community, it is stated in the Taif Agreement, that the first time a Parliament is elected on a non-confessional basis, there will be created a Senate with communal representation. As such, the Taif Agreement stipulates a third Republic with a bicameral system of representation. The crucial point is the relationship between the two chambers. With a strong Parliament, based on national representation, confessional representation in the second chamber will be weakened...|$|E

NUAs are hybrid products of government-led, entrepreneur-driven planning and self-organising space production by the residents. The self-organising space production activities contribute to the urban quality of these new urban spaces, while the production of privatised, commodified spaces by corporate actors poses a threat to community life...|$|R

However little is known about how integrated care plans for cancer patients are developed including featured core activities, facilitators for uptake and indicators for assessing impact. Methods: Given limited consensus around what constitutes an integrated care plan for cancer patients, a scoping review was conducted to explore the components of integrated care plans and contextual factors that influence design and uptake. Results: Five types of integrated care plans based on the stage of cancer care: surgical, systemic, survivorship, palliative and comprehensive (involving a transition between stages) are described in current literature. Breast, esophageal and colorectal cancers were common disease sites. Multi-disciplinary teams, patient needs assessment and <b>transitional</b> <b>planning</b> emerged as key features. Provider buy-in and training alongside informational technology support served as important facilitators for plan uptake. Provider-level measurement was considerably less robust compared to patient and system-level indicators.
