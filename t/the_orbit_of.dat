5|$|In 1821, Alexis Bouvard {{published}} astronomical {{tables of}} <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> Neptune's neighbour Uranus.

In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.|$|E

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> Mercury {{have been}} hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner {{thought he had}} seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
