25|$|Agentic-personal self principle: When identity-fused {{individuals}} become strongly {{aligned with}} a group, they {{are assumed to}} maintain an active and agentic personal self, even when the social self is activated. Consistent with this idea, activating the personal self by increasing physiological arousal, or encouraging people to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they would react if they were personally threatened, may increase the person's endorsement of extreme pro-group sacrifices. In contrast, the social identification perspective assumes that the personal and social selves are hydraulically related to one another. As such, activating the personal self should diminish endorsement of pro-group behavior. However, {{this was not the}} case for strongly fused individuals, who actually demonstrated the exact opposite effect.|$|E

25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

[...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said, [...] "It makes me sad to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> something so pleasurable has declined into something so tedious." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "With a laugh-skimpy script, 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' may be confirming a trend I noticed back with the last original SpongeBob toon to get its own disc release, Pest of the West: SpongeBob shorts are starting to get tired. And 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' is even less funny than 'Pest of the West'," [...] adding the episode was [...] "Not a good sign." ...|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah was {{released}} {{five years after}} One in a Million. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums {{to have such a}} gap between them. [...] "I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to just relax, <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, [...] "Romeo" [...] happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." [...] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album [...] "the attention it merited." [...] Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into Aaliyah as One in a Million had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on Aaliyah with her.|$|E

500|$|After {{development}} was finished, the team reflected {{that the fundamental}} part of a Super Mario game {{was to make the}} player <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> [...] "fun" [...] it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it. To accomplish this, Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people, including children. Shimizu added that Super Mario Galaxys ulterior motive was to have everybody [...] "gather around the TV", as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone. The game was made to support six different save files – Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own. Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released, there used to be [...] "many more" [...] people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience. Iwata asserted that well-made video games were more enjoyable to spectate, and hoped that Super Mario Galaxys co-operative mode would tempt someone who does not usually play video games to join.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro {{is dealing with the}} [...] "stink spirit." [...] The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> it can affect other living things.|$|E

But [...] I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'.
