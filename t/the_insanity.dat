5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense. The old Model Penal Code test was replaced by a test that shifts the burden of proof regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution to the defendant. Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{was indicted}} on October 14, 1881, {{for the murder}} of the President. In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often {{interrupted}} and argued, and in which his counsel used <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense, the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defence; where it is claimed that the defendant was insane {{at the time that}} he committed the crime, and where it is claimed that he was insane at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E

In August 2009, the band released Toying with <b>the</b> <b>Insanities</b> Volume I on gatefold CD, followed by Toying with <b>the</b> <b>Insanities</b> Volume II in September 2009.

In a mockumentary format, it shows Michael Scott (Steve Carell), regional manager of the Scranton branch office, as he tries to convince the filmmakers of the documentary that he presides over a happy, well-running office. Meanwhile, sales rep Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds methods to undermine his cube-mate, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson); receptionist Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) is trying to deal with Michael's insensitivities and flubs; and the temporary employee Ryan Howard (B.

5|$|Henry Fuseli {{would later}} create {{one of the}} more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783, {{entitled}} The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). The three of them are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

25|$|The verdict {{resulted}} in widespread dismay. As a consequence, the United States Congress {{and a number}} of states revised laws governing when <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense may be used by the defendant in a criminal prosecution. Idaho, Montana, and Utah abolished the defense altogether. In the United States, prior to the Hinckley case, <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense had been used in less than 2% of all felony cases and was unsuccessful in almost 75% of those trials. Public outcry over the verdict led to <b>the</b> <b>Insanity</b> Defense Reform Act of 1984, which altered the rules for consideration of mental illness of defendants in federal criminal court proceedings in the United States. In 1985, Hinckley's parents wrote Breaking Points, a book detailing their son's mental condition.|$|E

25|$|Although the defense's expert {{testimony}} agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, {{in order to}} successfully assert <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense, the defendant must prove {{that he or she}} could not discern right from wrong {{at the time of the}} crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected <b>the</b> <b>insanity</b> defense and found her guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the death penalty, the jury refused that option. The trial court sentenced her to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with eligibility for parole in 40 years.|$|E

The Writers Guild of Alberta awarded Saltwater Trees its Howard O'Hagan prize for short fiction. Reviewer Mary Walters Riskin noted the book was a fine beginning to Robinson's career. [...] "One of the most refreshing aspects of this collection is that so many of the 13 stories in Saltwater Trees rise out of <b>the</b> <b>insanities,</b> <b>the</b> batterings and the drudgeries of real life to end on notes of hope," [...] Riskin wrote.|$|R
