At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so that I might <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it?</b> I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, Valve flew two of {{the boycott}} group's most {{prominent}} members to Valve, in order to playtest Left 4 Dead 2; the two felt that the sequel was well done. This event, {{through a series of}} correspondences made in jest, shortly led to Valve's Gabe Newell and designer Erik Johnson flying to Australia to visit [...] "Joe W-A", a Left 4 Dead modder. Newell jokingly reported that Valve was [...] "boycotting" [...] Joe's new mod for the game when Joe asked when he would be flown to Valve {{in the same manner as}} the Left 4 Dead 2 boycotters, but whimsically offered that if Joe was to pay to fly him to the country, he would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Joe was able to raise the required funds, US$3000, through donations through his website, though ultimately Newell paid for the trip himself, with Joe's collected donations going to the Child's Play charity.|$|E

It had the air of a room whose owner has dashed in to fetch his golf-clubs and biffed off, after the casual fashion of the artist temperament, without bothering to close up behind him. And such, indeed, was the case. The studio had seen the last of J. B. Wheeler for that day: but Archie, not {{realising}} this and feeling that a chat with Mr. Wheeler, who was a light-hearted bird, was what he needed this morning, sat down to wait.

He told his wife that he guessed he had a sure thing of it now, and in another twenty-four hours he should tell her just how. He made Penelope go to the theatre with him, and when they came out, after the play, the night was so fine that he said they must walk round by the new house and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in the starlight.

Neither have I had any practical experience in conquering magicians. But let us consider this case. What is Ugu, and what is a magician? Ugu is a renegade shoemaker, and a magician is an ordinary man who, having learned how to do magical tricks, considers himself above his fellows. In this case, the Shoemaker has been naughty enough to steal a lot of magical tools and things that {{did not belong to}} him, and he is more wicked to steal than to be a magician. Yet with all the arts at his command, Ugu is still a man, and surely there are ways in which a man may be conquered. How, do you say, how? Allow me to state that I don't know. In my judgment, we cannot decide how best to act until we get to Ugu's castle.
