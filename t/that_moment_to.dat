25|$|The {{outcome was}} not {{a vote in the}} Commons, but a kind of truce until, in August 1874, Gladstone {{transferred}} Ayrton from the Board of Works to the office of Judge Advocate-General, just before his government fell. Ayrton failed to get re-elected to Parliament. From <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> this, the value of the Botanic Gardens has never been seriously questioned. In the midst of this crisis, Hooker was elected as President of the Royal Society in 1873. This showed publicly the high regard which Hooker's fellow scientists had for him, and the great importance they attached to his work.|$|E

Edmund is {{initially}} eager to fight but, observing the combatants from afar, he comes to the realisation that fighting could lead to death. He decides at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> remain a spectator and then hides behind a bush to relieve himself.|$|E

500|$|Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror lauded the film's {{direction}} and cinematography saying, [...] "Menon has the tenacity of a Sofia Coppola to produce frames where not much happens but one {{is unable to}} look away", and concluded, [...] "The film deserves a watch for being one that doesn't try too hard and for its approach to an extreme situation." [...] Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle, while also praising the technical expertise, said, [...] "Neha Parti Matiyani beautifully captures the beautiful city of Kochi" [...] and called the film [...] "unmissable" [...] saying, [...] "'Waiting' is a refreshing subject that is engaging enough right up till its open ended climax." [...] Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express thought that the film was [...] "too explanatory, too talky", and that [...] "the most effective moments in the film occur when the two leads are allowed to fall silent, to just be in <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>to</b> loosen up". While lauding the film's treatment of the subject matter, Gupta described Waiting as [...] "a film about life, lasting love and impending loss which explores a zone Bollywood doesn't bother with".|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
