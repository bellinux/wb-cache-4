25|$|The reader {{may wonder}} why a {{competent}} scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation {{by taking the}} time to undertake such a thankless task.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the notice is to alert all {{creditors}} of the intended application, in case they should wish to oppose it. It follows that the notice must be published in a newspaper in the usual sense. What if the newspaper was published in Hebrew and was devoted only to Jewish interests, as in Ex parte Goldman? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this would not suffice. The newspaper must be one which caters to general interests.|$|E
25|$|The First Test was, I {{honestly}} think, the dullest {{and most}} depressing I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and a bit to spare.|$|E
60|$|At length, after a pause, Mr. Marais, {{pointing}} to myself, {{a small and}} stubbly-haired youth with a sharp nose, asked my father whether he would like me to be instructed in the French tongue. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> nothing would please him better.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} four or five places he visited, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no such party had arrived; then, seeing one of the civic guards, he {{asked him if he}} had seen or heard of a troop of men passing through the town.|$|R
40|$|The 1966 science-fction film Fantastic Voyage {{captured}} the public imagination with a clever idea: what fantastic things might {{we see and}} do if we could minaturize ourselves and travel through the bloodstream as corpuscles do? (This being Hollywood, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we'd save a fellow scientist from evildoers. ...|$|R
25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would we allow him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. And what about prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would we allow him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in those cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One should be proud to be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E
500|$|According to Ohlin (op. cit., p.222), one cannot say [...] "that {{the rate}} of {{interest}} equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does not do that. How, then, is {{the height of the}} interest rate determined. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the rate of}} interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system – through its ability to give credit – can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So the {{question}} is why didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky believed that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the central problems, like commonsense reasoning, were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E
60|$|Crœsus was really, as {{the most}} {{unlikely}} thing to be guessed, boiling a tortoise and a lamb together in a brazen vessel. Sure now of {{the truth of the}} oracle, he sent splendid gifts, and asked whether he should go to war with Cyrus. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> if he did, a mighty kingdom would be overthrown.|$|R
60|$|Mr. William {{followed}} Pacifico {{as he went}} out, {{in order}} to speak a moment {{to a friend of}} his who occupied the next apartment. As he came back he met Pacifico {{at the head of the}} stairs, and received his <b>answer</b> there. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Copley had gone down the river to Ostia with another boy.|$|R
25|$|When Franz Joseph {{received}} the telegram informing him of Elisabeth's death, his first fear <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she had committed suicide. It {{was only when}} a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> relieved of <b>that</b> notion. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> whatever procedures <b>were</b> prescribed by Swiss Law should be adhered to.|$|R
500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|This leads Hazlitt to {{consider}} why, when Falstaff [...] "is {{represented as a}} liar, a braggart, a coward, a glutton, etc., [...] we are not offended but delighted with him [...]" [...] <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "he is all these as much to amuse others as to gratify himself. He openly assumes all these characters to shew the humourous part of them. The unrestrained indulgence of his own ease, appetites, and convenience, has neither malice nor hypocrisy in it. In a word, he is an actor in himself {{almost as much as}} upon the stage, and we no more object to the character of Falstaff in a moral point of view than we should think of bringing an excellent comedian, who should represent him to the life, before one of the police offices." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they are}} seen, but {{the effects are}} tiny. The reason is that {{planetary}} velocities are extremely small compared to the speed of light, so that for planets and satellites of the solar system, the [...] term dwarfs the spatial terms.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> none, as yet, {{had come}} south of Luneville; and that indeed, at present {{they were too}} much {{occupied}} at Metz, and Strasburg, {{to be able to}} detach any formidable parties. Small bodies of Uhlans occasionally had made raids, and driven in sheep and cattle; but they had not ventured to trust themselves very far into the mountains.|$|R
60|$|The {{king had}} no doubt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he himself <b>was</b> the one.|$|R
60|$|Croesus had sent, a {{long time}} before, to inquire of the Delphic oracle by what means the power of speech could be {{restored}} to his son. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a boon which he had better not ask; for the day on which he should hear his son speak for the first time, would be the darkest and most unhappy day of his life.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, one can {{calculate}} {{the value of}} shape parameters required for the geometric mean to equal1/2. Given {{the value of the}} parameter β, what would be the value of the other parameter,α, required for the geometric mean to equal1/2?. [...] <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> (for [...] ), the value of α required tends towards [...] as [...] For example, all these couples have the same geometric mean of1/2: , , , , , , [...]|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the other}} side is black with {{probability}} [...] However, common intuition suggests a probability of [...] either because there are two cards with black on them that this card could be, or because there are 3 white and 3 black sides and many people forget to eliminate the possibility of the [...] "white card" [...] in this situation (i.e. the card they flipped CANNOT be the [...] "white card" [...] because a black side was turned over).|$|E
2500|$|Fernand Braudel {{sets the}} end of {{sporadic}} warfare between the two early centers of aquatic empire {{as a result of}} the economic retrenchment of the 14th century: [...] "Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> only prolonged prosperity and a rising tide of trade had made it possible to indulge for so long in battles which were fierce but not in the end mortal... Both major and minor wars had become too expensive a luxury. Peaceful coexistence would have to be the rule." ...|$|E
50|$|In June 2005, an {{environmental}} group, Alburnus Maior, asked the Romanian Supreme Court, under {{the freedom of}} information laws, whether Timiș was under any investigations. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his name <b>was</b> linked with three dossiers investigated by the organised crime department. However, Timiș denied all the claims and no charges were ever filed. Later queries to the Romanian administration on this subject <b>were</b> given <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> no investigations concerning Timiș.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked what}} {{happened}} when men who could not produce the necessary coppers {{to pay for their}} lodging, applied for admission. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> matter <b>was</b> left to the discretion of the Officer in charge. In fact, in cases of absolute and piteous want, men are admitted free, although, naturally enough, the Army does not advertise that this happens. If it did, its hospitality would be considerably overtaxed.|$|R
50|$|The Dutch {{commander}} Van Ghent, {{who knew}} both Sir William {{and his wife}} very well, had himself rowed over to the small vessel to enquire what <b>the</b> problem <b>was.</b> <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> yacht expected to be greeted as a full warship, as a 1662 treaty prescribed. Van Ghent <b>answered</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> doubtful {{as to whether the}} Merlin <b>was</b> in <b>that</b> category {{and did not want to}} create a precedent.|$|R
2500|$|Second, {{there are}} {{infinitely}} many possible surfaces [...] {{that have the}} curve [...] as their border. (Imagine a soap film on a wire loop, which can be deformed by moving the wire). Which of those surfaces is to be chosen? If the loop does not lie in a single plane, for example, {{there is no one}} obvious choice. [...] <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it does not matter; it can be proven that any surface with boundary [...] can be chosen.|$|E
2500|$|As to {{why and how}} a story, not data, should dictate choices, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is {{the story}} which encodes the causal {{relationships}} among the variables. Once we explicate these relationships and represent them formally, we can test which partition gives the correct treatment preference. For example, if we represent causal relationships in a graph called [...] "causal diagram" [...] (see Bayesian networks), we can test whether nodes that represent the proposed partition intercept spurious paths in the diagram. This test, called [...] "back-door," [...] reduces Simpson's paradox to an exercise in graph theory.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{simplest}} ways to approach the concept of universal grammar is to pose a hypothetical question about an aspect of language acquisition in children – why does a child learn the language that it does. As a specific example, how can a child of Asian descent (say, born of Chinese parents) be set {{down in the middle}} of Topeka, Kansas and acquire [...] "perfect English?" [...] <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the child does not start with [...] "Chinese", or any other conventionally defined language, in its head. The child does start with general grammatical rules that determine linguistic properties.|$|E
50|$|One {{waitress}} {{has said}} that she has heard footsteps, while working alone, in the attic. When she confronted someone, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no one <b>was</b> ever up there. No one wants to go downstairs for they feel a strange presence. As for Anthony, while upstairs and lying in his Queen Sized Bed, he felt someone {{on the other side}} of his bed... just lying there. Once he got up, there was no body there.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} GNU MediaGoblin {{date back to}} 2008, when a {{gathering}} {{was held at the}} Free Software Foundation in order to discuss the path that Internet communities should take. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> restrictive and centralized structures were both technically and ethically doubtful, and may harm the typical fairness and availability of the Internet. Since then, a number of projects have appeared to prevent this; including Identi.ca, Libre.fm, Diaspora, among others.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Orthodox <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both Ruth and Naamah were {{converts}} to Judaism: the Talmud derives {{the laws of}} proselytes from the exchange between Naomi and Ruth.|$|R
2500|$|At the Salon, his paintings—Self-Portrait, {{portraits of}} the Rivière family, and Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne—received a very chilly reception. David {{delivered}} a severe judgement, and the critics were hostile. Chaussard (Le Pausanias Français, 1806) [...] praised [...] "the fineness of Ingres's brushwork and the finish", but condemned Ingres's style as gothic and asked: How, with so much talent, a line so flawless, an attention to detail so thorough, has M. Ingres succeeded in painting a bad picture? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{he wanted to do}} something singular, something extraordinary... M. Ingres's intention is nothing less than to make art regress by four centuries, to carry us back to its infancy, to revive the manner of Jean de Bruges.|$|E
2500|$|The former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel (1983–93), Mordechai Eliyahu, was Kahane's {{personal}} mentor, {{and one of}} Kahane's staunchest supporters. Eliyahu {{wrote an}} approbation to Kahane's Tanakh commentary, [...] "Perush Hamacabee", where he refers to Kahane as [...] "HaRav HaGaon" [...] ("the rabbinic genius"), a praiseworthy title attributed to the very saintly. Eliyahu wrote that, [...] "Only the Torah way interested Kahane, which he constantly toiled over and which served as his strength", and, [...] "When one considers the depth and clarity of [...] works, one is astonished at how he {{had the time to}} compile such. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ... all his time and thoughts were invested in Torah while other matters were secondary. Fortunate is the family that publishes his works for others to learn from." [...] At Kahane's funeral, Eliyahu stated that Kahane was a reincarnation of a fearless biblical character.|$|E
2500|$|One of Baugh's {{more famous}} claims, {{aside from the}} dinosaur tracks, is the London Hammer, an alleged out of place {{artifact}} of an [...] "18th century miner's hammer" [...] found in million-year-old Ordovician rock (he has also claimed it is in Cretaceous rock) found in 1934 from London, Texas. Baugh asserted this as evidence against scientifically known ways that rocks form. However, laboratory tests discounted his claim about the hammer's being formed in the rock. J.R. Cole wrote, [...] "The stone concretion is real, and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes. How could a modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician rock? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the concretion itself is not Ordovician. Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock (in this case, reportedly Ordovician) is chemically soluble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First," [...] said Stephen, [...] "was <b>the</b> Declaration. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> to <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Plea. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> to <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Replication. Then {{came the}} Rejoinder, then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter. But they rarely got that far," [...] he added unwisely.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1940s Aldo Leopold {{understood}} {{the need for}} zapovednik-type reserves: [...] "While even the largest wilderness areas become partially deranged, it required only a few wild acres for J. E. Weaver to discover why the prairie flora is more drought-resistant than the agronomic flora which has supplanted it." [...] <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wild prairie had a much more complex, and more efficient, root system, and this {{could only have been}} discovered by studying the undisturbed natural ecosystem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lady Quilla {{should be}} given in {{marriage}} to the Prince Urco, but as she was absent on a visit, this could not happen until she returned. But since then, O Huaracha, more rumours have reached me that you still prepare for war and seek to make alliances among my subjects, tempting them to rebel against me. Therefore I am here myself to lead away the lady Quilla and to deliver her to the Prince Urco." ...|$|R
