The Catholic Encyclopedia reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the chi-rho emblem on early Christian sarcophagi, but the compilers considered <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be quite as probable that this was only meant for a laurel wreath.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{increased}} spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans {{to take the}} song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> represent English fans' activity of standing {{in the hot sun}} drinking lager all day, it became a description as well as a song. David Lloyd and Ian Botham used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for Sky Sports during England's tours from 1993 to 1995.|$|E

25|$|Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, {{the former}} President of India, in his Tipu Sultan Shaheed Memorial Lecture in Bangalore (30 November 1991), called Tipu Sultan the {{innovator}} of the world's first war rocket. Two of these rockets, {{captured by the}} British at Srirangapatna, were displayed in the Royal Artillery Museum in London. According to historian Dr Dulari Qureshi Tipu Sultan was a fierce warrior king and was so quick in his movement <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> the enemy that he was fighting on many fronts at the same time. Tipu managed to subdue all the petty kingdoms in the south. He defeated the Nizams and {{was also one of}} the few Indian rulers to have defeated British armies. He is said to have started a new coinage, calendar, and a new system of weights and measures mainly based on the methods introduced by French technicians.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

It premiered in the United States on January 14, 2010, on Fox, to 6.529 million viewers and a 2.6 share 18–49. The episode {{received}} average reviews, as many critics compared it either negatively or positively to a B-movie, though most agreed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be rehashed from older The X-Files episodes. Several {{of the main}} actors, however, thoroughly enjoyed the episode; Noble named it {{one of his favorite}} Fringe episodes. Critics also noted the popular culture references to The Wizard of Oz (1939), Deliverance (1972), and Joseph Merrick.|$|E
500|$|Japanese gaming {{magazine}} Famitsu gave Dragon Quest X a {{score of}} 36 points out of 40, who delayed their review until they had sufficient experience with the game after launch. One reviewer praised the presentation [...] "from the warmly familiar world to the story that {{has a tendency to}} wrap you up in it". They also praised the gameplay and its openness to accept novice players, despite the reviewer noting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> take longer to level up a character compared to offline Dragon Quest entries. Two of the other reviewers pointed out issues with messaging, and a lack of guidance about which enemies were too strong for a player character's current level.|$|E
500|$|Toon Zone noted Shiotani's {{lack of a}} {{particular}} directing style, saying that it ultimately hurt the script and added nothing to the movie: main praise {{was given to the}} animation, aside from the CGI sequences, and Satō's more forceful and heroic musical score. It praised the story as [...] "moving yet intense" [...] despite Fumito's lack of presence, saying that it provided suitable closure for Saya and the storyline of Blood-C, but noting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be designed as an apology to fans who were upset by the series' unconventional tone—this was noted in both the more sympathetic supporting cast, Saya's altered presentation, and the general toning down of blood and gore. The site ultimately felt that this attitude meant the conclusion was rushed and that the final battle was an unwise departure from the Blood franchise's previous realism.|$|E

500|$|Two Swedish {{models were}} {{cast as the}} Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams. Ekland had been {{interested}} in playing a Bond girl since she had seen Dr. No, and contacted the producers about the main role of Mary Goodnight. Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because [...] "she was elegant and beautiful <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me she was the perfect Bond girl". When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for The Man with the Golden Gun, she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role, as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's [...] "generous looks" [...] made her a good contrast to Adams. Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on Diamonds Are Forever, to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga {{at the start of}} the film, because he found it an interesting idea to [...] "put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand".|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a D-. The review described it as [...] "insultingly bad," [...] noting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "ripping off" [...] both the first-season episode [...] "Ice" [...] and the 1979 film Alien. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen felt that [...] "Firewalker" [...] represented a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach to the series, following from the previous story arc relating to Scully's abduction. Handlen noted that the episode would have been [...] "a total waste of time" [...] elsewhere in the season's schedule, but served as a [...] "competent enough" [...] means of reuniting the main characters. Howard Gordon was praiseful of physical effects supervisor Toby Lindala's work on this episode, quipping that Lindala's effects [...] "won the gross-out award". Gordon also praised Nutter's job in directing the episode. Carter said that [...] "Firewalker" [...] was a very successful episode. David Nutter added a nice directorial touch; the guest appearances were very good".|$|E
500|$|MacDonald deems Lennon's {{remark about}} the Beatles' [...] "god-like status" [...] in March 1966 {{to have been}} [...] "fairly realistic", given the {{reaction}} to Revolver. He adds: [...] "The album's aural invention was so masterful <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Western youth that The Beatles knew – {{that they had the}} key to current events and were somehow orchestrating them through their records." [...] MacDonald highlights [...] "the radically subversive" [...] message of [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] – exhorting listeners to empty their minds of all ego- and material-related thought – as the inauguration of a [...] "till-then élite-preserved concept of mind-expansion into pop, simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness-enhancing drugs and the ancient religious philosophies of the Orient". Author Shawn Levy writes that the album presented an alternative reality that contemporary listeners felt compelled to explore further; he describes it as [...] "the first true drug album, not a pop record with some druggy insinuations, but an honest-to-heaven, steeped-in-the-out-there trip from the here and now into who knew where".|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{disliked the}} UK cover of Are You Experienced, so {{arrangements}} {{were made for}} a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to hear more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E
