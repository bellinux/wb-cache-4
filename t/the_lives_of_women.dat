5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the classical world.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Fries Lummis Ellet (October 18, 1818 – June 3, 1877) was an American writer, {{historian}} and poet. She {{was the first}} writer to record <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> who contributed to the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children. Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} society and <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which {{part of the country}} they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E

25|$|In {{almost every}} country in the world, men are put above women. Although this case is not true for every country, it applies to most of the world. Gender {{equality}} is an issue that is being developed and is essential for women and men to participate equally in society and in the economy. An organization called the World’s Bank’s Africa Region Gender is dedicated to improving <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and men by supporting government partners with knowledge and finance.|$|E
25|$|Amongst {{his daughters}} Swarnakumari Devi (1855–1932) was a gifted writer, editor, song-composer and social worker. She was editor of Bharati, a {{remarkable}} accomplishment {{in an age}} when very few girls went to school. She also edited a children's magazine Balak and developed Sakhi Samiti as a means for improving <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> She was the author of several books. Her husband Janakinath Ghosal was {{one of the founders of}} the Indian National Congress, so she participated in nationalist activities with him.|$|E
25|$|She worked {{diligently}} {{to improve}} <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> at the American School, encouraging {{the administration to}} provide housing for women at the school. Being financially independent, she also became a major donor of the school. During the 1920s, Walker worked on the pottery uncovered at Corinth at Corinth's expedition headquarters. Working on excavations until 1935, Walker continued to add artifacts to her new finds of pottery of the Neolithic period. At this point in her career, she had become the foremost expert of the Neolithic Period in Southern Greece.|$|E

25|$|Huysmans {{followed}} {{it with the}} novel, Marthe, Histoire d'une fille (1876). The {{story of a young}} prostitute, it was closer to Naturalism and brought him to the attention of Émile Zola. His next works were similar: sombre, realistic and filled with detailed evocations of Paris, a city Huysmans knew intimately. Les Soeurs Vatard (1879), dedicated to Zola, deals with <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in a bookbindery. En ménage (1881) is an account of a writer's failed marriage. The climax of his early work is the novella À vau-l'eau (1882) (Downstream or With the Flow), the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his quest for a decent meal.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Western and Orient world where divorce was relatively uncommon until modern times, divorce was a more common occurrence {{in certain parts of}} the late medieval Muslim world. In the Mamluk Sultanate and Ottoman Empire, the rate of divorce was high. The work of the scholar and historian Al-Sakhawi (1428-1497) on <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> show that the marriage pattern of Egyptian and Syrian urban society in the fifteenth century was greatly influenced by easy divorce, and practically untouched by polygamy. Earlier Egyptian documents from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries also showed a similar but more extreme pattern: in a sample of 273 women, 118 (45%) married a second or third time. Edward Lane's careful observation of urban Egypt {{in the early nineteenth century}} suggests that the same regime of frequent divorce and rare polygamy was still applicable in these last days of traditional society. In the early 20th century, some villages in western Java and the Malay peninsula had divorce rates as high as 70%.|$|E
25|$|Nicolae Batzaria {{eventually}} resettled in Bucharest. He {{embarked on}} a career in writing, publishing a succession of fiction and nonfiction volumes in Romanian. He was, in January 1919, a co-founder of Greater Romania's original journalists' trade union (Union of Professional Journalists), and, in 1921, published his În închisorile turcești with Editura Alcaly. He later produced a series of books detailing <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the Ottoman Empire and the modern Turkish state: Spovedanii de cadâne. Nuvele din viața turcească ("Confessions of Turkish Odalisques. Novellas from Turkish Life", 1921), Turcoaicele ("The Turkish Women", 1921), Sărmana Lila. Roman din viața cadânelor ("Poor Leila. A Novel from the Life of Odalisques", 1922), Prima turcoaică ("The First of Turkish Women", n.d.), {{as well as several}} translations of foreign books on this subject. One of his stories about Ottoman womanhood, Vecina dela San-Stefano ("The Neighbor of Yeşilköy"), was published by the literary review Gândirea in its June 1922 issue. Around the same time, the Viața Românească publishers issued his booklet România văzută de departe ("Romania Seen from a Distance"), a book of essays which sought to revive confidence and self-respect among Romanian citizens.|$|E

25|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} society and <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied according to factors including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which {{part of the country}} they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men. After the Norman invasion, the position of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of the}} development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the twelfth century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E
500|$|The {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in Classical Athens {{has been a}} {{significant}} part of classical scholarship since the 1970s. [...] Our knowledge of Athenian women's lives comes from a variety of ancient sources. [...] Much of it is literary evidence, primarily from tragedy, comedy, and oratory; supplemented with archaeological sources such as epigraphy and pottery. [...] All of these sources were created by [...] and mostly for [...] men: there is no surviving ancient testimony by Classical Athenian women on their own lives.|$|E
500|$|Scholarly {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> {{in the ancient}} world has continued to increase. By 2000, a review of books focused on women in ancient Greece published over a three-year period could cover eighteen works without being exhaustive. The range of subjects covered by women's historians also increased substantially; in 1980 the question of women's status was the most important topic to historians of Athenian women, but by 2000 scholars were also working on [...] "gender, the body, sexuality, masculinity and other topics".|$|E
