5|$|These happenings were a first {{cumulation}} {{of a civil}} commotion, {{that had}} started {{a few days earlier}} with large strikes and demonstrations. On 4November 1918, a first workers' council under the leadership of the 23-year-old Spartacist Fritz Rück had been established in Stuttgart. During the following days and weeks more spontaneously elected worker and soldier councils were formed, and <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> large part of Württemberg. Rau was elected leader of the military police in his home city of Zuffenhausen, a part of Stuttgart's urban area.|$|E
5|$|Webb {{demonstrated}} his aggressiveness when {{he attempted}} to sortie on the first spring tide (30 May) after taking command, but Atlantas forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions, and the ship ran aground. She was not damaged although it <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> day to pull her free. He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide, rejecting Mallory's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound. Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships.|$|E
5|$|West <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{year and}} {{invested}} two million dollars towards {{the construction of}} Late Registration. The majority of the recording sessions for the album took place at Sony Music Studios in New York City and at The Record Plant in Hollywood, California; other sessions took place at Chalice Recording Studios and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood. He began working in the studio after he finished touring with Usher on the R singer's The Truth Tour. By November 2004, West had completed nearly seventy-five percent of the album. However he felt unsatisfied with its outcome and in March of the following year, he brought in Jon Brion, which drastically altered the project's direction.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Whale volunteered his services to make a training film for the United States Army. He shot the film, called Personnel Placement in the Army, in February 1942. Later that year, in association with actress Claire DuBrey, he created the Brentwood Service Players. The Players <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> 100–seat theatre. Sixty seats were provided free of charge to service personnel; the remaining were sold to the public, with the box office proceeds donated to wartime charities. The group expanded to the Playtime Theatre during the summer, where a series of shows ran through October.|$|E
5|$|Following high school, Ross {{embarked}} on his professional career, getting {{selected by the}} Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. He reached the Major Leagues in 2003, but suffered a torn ACL which caused him to miss most of September. He {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers following spring training in 2004, appearing in a handful of games with them in 2005. In 2006, he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Florida Marlins. It was in Florida that he finally established himself, as he played with the Marlins through 2010. He was used mainly as a reserve outfielder in 2006 and 2007, but during the 2008 season he <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> starting role. He would be a starting outfielder {{for the rest of his}} Marlins career, playing centerfield or right field. In 2009, he hit a career-high 24 home runs and won the Marlins' Charlie Hough Good Guy award.|$|E
5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana. His father died in 1895, and {{to make ends meet}} his mother took work at a canning plant. As the eldest child at the age of five, Sanders was left to care for his two siblings. When he turned seven his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at age 13, Sanders pursued several professions {{including}} railroad worker and insurance salesman, with mixed success. In 1930, he <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, a small city {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. By June, he had converted a storeroom into a small eating area using his own dining table, serving meals such as steaks and country ham to travelers.|$|E

5|$|Having {{made the}} journey to Egypt {{travelling}} via South Africa and the Red Sea due {{to the threat of}} attack that was present in the Mediterranean, the battalion arrived just before New Years. The 18th Brigade was again reassigned in February 1941, this time to the 7th Division, with whom they would see out the remainder of the war; at the same time, the brigade was converted from a four-battalion structure to three, and the 2/11th was transferred to help form the 19th Brigade. On 21 March 1941, the battalion undertook its first ground action of the war, when one of its companies– 'D' Company– supported the 2/9th Battalion in their attack on the Italian held fort at Giarabub. The battalion's first major action as a complete unit did not come until April 1941, though, when it undertook defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk. During the Battle of the Salient, fought in early May, the 2/10th <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> position on the northern flank of the perimeter, relieving the 2/48th Battalion, coming under heavy air attack during the handover.|$|E
5|$|Ideas for a Conan film were {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1970; Pressman and associate producer Edward Summer began {{a concerted effort to}} get the film made in 1975. It took them two years to obtain the film rights, after which they recruited Schwarzenegger for the lead role and Oliver Stone to draft a script. Pressman lacked capital for the endeavor, and in 1979, after having his proposals for investments rejected by the major studios, he sold the project to Dino De Laurentiis. Milius was appointed as director and he rewrote Stone's script. The final screenplay integrated scenes from Howard's stories and from films such as Kwaidan and Seven Samurai. Filming took place in Spain over five months in the regions around Madrid and Almería. The sets, designed by Ron Cobb, were based on Dark Age cultures and Frank Frazetta's paintings of Conan. Milius eschewed optical effects, preferring to realize his ideas with mechanical constructs and optical illusions. Schwarzenegger performed most of his own stunts, and two types of swords, costing $10,000 each, were forged for his character. The editing process <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> year and several violent scenes were cut.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, the {{decision}} was made to transfer part of the AIF to Europe to take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium. Still attached to the 7th Brigade, the 27th Battalion entered the front-line for the first time on 7 April 1916 as the Australians <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> quiet sector near Armentières. On 8 July 1916, the 7th Brigade was ordered to march to the Somme to support the Australian 1st Division which was taking part in the fighting around Pozières. On 28 July, the 7th Brigade undertook an attack on the German line, however, during this time the 27th Battalion was held back in reserve. The attack proved unsuccessful and as a result it was ordered to launch a second attack on 4 August, centred upon German positions around Bapaume.|$|E
