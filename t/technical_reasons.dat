5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For <b>technical</b> <b>reasons</b> (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} USAF {{officers}} {{were unable to}} explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for <b>technical</b> <b>reasons</b> that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.|$|E

Transport planning has had little exposure to the communicative perspective. This paper examines transport planning in Auckland, New Zealand, from a communicative planning perspective. The paper argues that the historical dominance of <b>technical</b> <b>reason</b> has biased strategic transport policy towards supporting automobiles over more sustainable modes. The paper demonstrates the dominance of technical rationality in transport strategy-making processes and institutions in contrast to expressed public preferences. The paper concludes by arguing that the achievement of greater sustainability in Auckland&# 039;s transport, and elsewhere, depends on a greater communicative emphasis in regional planning and transport strategy making...|$|R

5|$|On 1 June 1941, the Red Army had 10,268 T-26 light {{tanks of}} all models on their inventories, {{including}} {{armoured combat vehicles}} based on the T-26 chassis. T-26s composed {{a majority of the}} fighting vehicles in Soviet mechanised corps of the border military districts. For instance, the Western Special Military District had 1,136 T-26 tanks on 22 June 1941 (52 percent of all tanks in the district). The T-26 (mod. 1938/39, especially) could withstand most German tanks in 1941 but were inferior to the Panzer III and Panzer IV participating in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and all of the Red Army's tank models suffered severe losses due to the air supremacy of the German Luftwaffe. The majority of the Red Army's T-26s were lost in the first months of the German-Soviet War, mainly to enemy artillery and air attacks. Many tanks broke down for <b>technical</b> <b>reasons</b> and lack of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for <b>technical</b> <b>reasons,</b> and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of its}} distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for <b>technical</b> <b>reasons.</b> Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E

By 1993, the rate had dropped to 42 percent, with about 69 percent of those revoked for <b>technical</b> <b>reasons.</b> The reason for the drop may have been that releasees who are {{in the early years of}} their term of supervised release are more likely to be revoked; when supervised release was first introduced, all of the releasees were in this high-risk category.|$|E
