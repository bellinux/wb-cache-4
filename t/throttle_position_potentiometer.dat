5000|$|A <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> sensor (TPS) is {{a sensor}} {{used to monitor}} the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the {{butterfly}} spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the <b>position</b> of the <b>throttle.</b> More advanced forms of the sensor are also used, for example an extra closed <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> sensor (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the throttle is completely closed. Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> electronic <b>throttle</b> control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|R

50|$|Both the B1 and B2 {{featured}} Fuel Injection. The B1 model featured an EFI (electronic) {{system that}} was modelled on the 1980 z1000H and (also used in the 1980 z1000G model). This system was a hybrid car design using an air flap that had many reliability issues causing most owners to end up removing it {{and replace it with}} the 34mm Keihin CV carburettors used on all the later z1000 and z1100 models. The key problem with the EFI on the B1 was the use of an air-flap design rather than a MAP sensor used in modern systems and the early <b>Throttle</b> <b>Position</b> sensor (TPS) design registered only open or closed (idle) <b>throttle</b> <b>positions.</b> Later models (B2 and ZX1100A)featured DFI (digital) which used a variable TPS that accurately represented the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> and hence a better Electronic Control Unit (ECU) algorithm called Alpha-N.|$|R

2500|$|A {{primitive}} way {{to implement}} cruise control {{is simply to}} lock the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> when the driver engages cruise control. [...] However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an open-loop controller {{because there is no}} feedback; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the <b>throttle</b> <b>position.)</b> As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.|$|R

The experiments are carried out with different mixture strength, stream velocity and <b>throttle</b> <b>positions.</b> It is observed that A/F ratio has no effect on SMD. However, stream velocity and <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> have a significant influence on SMD.

40|$|This paper determines, using {{artificial}} neural-networks (ANNs), {{the performance}} of and exhaust emissions from a diesel engine with respect to injection pressure, engine speed and <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> The design injection-pressure of the diesel engine, for the turbocharger and pre-combustion chamber used, is 150 bar. Experiments have been performed for four pressures, namely 100, 150, 200 and 250 bar with <b>throttle</b> <b>positions</b> of 50, 75 and 100 %. Engine torque, power, brake mean effective pressure, specific fuel consumption, fuel flow, and exhaust emissions such as SO 2, CO 2, NOx and smoke level (%N) have been investigated.

40|$|AbstractExperimental {{study has}} been carried out to analyze engine {{performance}} and emissions characteristics for diesel ngine using different blend fuels without any engine modifications. A total of four fuel samples, such as DF (100 % iesel fuel), JB 5 (5 % jatropha biodiesel and 95 % DF), JB 10 (10 % JB and 90 % DF) and J 5 W 5 (5 % JB, 5 % waste ooking oil and 90 % DF) respectively were used in this study. Engine performance test was carried out at 100 % load eeping throttle 100 % wide open with variable speeds of 1500 to 2400 rpm at an interval of 100 rpm. Whereas, mission tests were carried out at 2300 rpm at 100 % and 80 % <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> As results of investigations, the erage torque reduction compared to DF for JB 5, JB 10 and J 5 W 5 was found as 0. 63 %, 1. 63 % and 1. 44 % and verage power reduction was found as 0. 67 %, 1. 66 % and 1. 54 % respectively. Average increase in bsfc compared to F was observed as 0. 54 %, 1. 0 % JB 10 and 1. 14 % for JB 5, JB 10 and J 5 W 5 respectively. In case of engine exhaust as emissions, compared to DF average reduction in HC for JB 5, JB 10 and J 5 W 5 at 2300 rpm and 100 % throttle osition found as 8. 96 %, 11. 25 % and 12. 50 %, whereas, at 2300 and 80 % <b>throttle</b> <b>position,</b> reduction was as 16. 28 %, 0. 23 % and 31. 98 % respectively. Average reduction in CO at 2300 rpm and 100 % <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> for JB 5, JB 10 and 5 W 5 was found as 17. 26 %, 25. 92 % and 26. 87 %, whereas, at 80 % <b>throttle</b> <b>position,</b> reduction was observed as 0. 70 %, 33. 24 % and 35. 57 %. Similarly, the reduction in CO 2 compared to DF for JB 5, JB 10 and J 5 W 5 at 2300 rpm nd 100 % <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> was as 12. 10 %, 20. 51 % and 24. 91 %, whereas, at 80 % <b>throttle</b> <b>position,</b> reductions was bserved as 5. 98 %, 10. 38 % and 18. 49 % respectively. However, some NOx emissions were increased for all blend els compared to DF. In case of noise emission, sound level for all blend fuels was reduced compared to DF. It can e concluded that JB 5, JB 10 and J 5 W 5 can be used in diesel engines without any engine modifications However, 5 B 5 produced some better results when compared to JB 10...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was effects of {{ignition}} timing of a spark- ignition engine using different initial timing and engine speeds on engine performance by experimental. The overall results show that ignition timing can be used as an alternative way for predicting the performance of internal combustion engines. In this paper, the best results were obtained at 31 °BTDC for 3400 RPM. Also engine speed and <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> were all found to significantly influence performance in this engine. Volumetric efficiency, BMEP have increased with rising ignition timing. HC with advance of ignition timing increased, O 2, CO 2, CO has been almost constant and the lowest amount NOx is obtained at 10 °BTDC.
