His Japanese and English voice actors, Romi Park and Vic Mignogna, have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite <b>the</b> <b>stubborn</b> resistance offered by the Dutch troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and they found {{that some of the}} Dutch soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered.|$|E

This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Onjong, the Chinese recognized the ROK II Corps as the most vulnerable unit of the Eighth Army. Besides lacking the firepower of their US counterpart, the ROK II Corps also held the most difficult terrain on the UN right flank. At 10 a.m. on November 24, the ROK 7th Infantry Division on the II Corps' left flank attacked north from Tokchon. At the same time, the ROK 8th Infantry Division on the II Corps' right flank advanced north from Yongwon. <b>The</b> <b>stubborn</b> defenses by the PVA 38th and 42nd Corps soon ground the Korean advances to a halt, and the continuous fighting for the next two days failed to create any gains for the Koreans. During the advances, the Chinese defenses managed to create a wedge {{in the center of the}} ROK 7th Infantry Division, forcing the division to commit most of its reserves on the front line. Meanwhile, the ROK 6th Infantry Division in the II Corps' rear could only offer its 2nd Infantry Regiment as the corps' reserve due to the earlier losses at Onjong.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Kamarja {{was fought}} in 729 between the Arab Muslims of the Umayyad Caliphate and the Turgesh khaganate, {{along with its}} Soghdian allies. The Umayyad conquest of Transoxiana had been undone in the 720s by the uprisings of the local Soghdian princes and the Turgesh invasions. By 729, the small {{fortress}} of Kamarja near Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan) {{was one of the}} last remaining Arab strongholds in Transoxiana, when it was attacked by the Turgesh under the personal direction of their ruler, Suluk. The subsequent siege, for which a detailed account survives in the history of al-Tabari, lasted for 58 days and ended with the negotiated withdrawal of its garrison to Samarkand. <b>The</b> <b>stubborn</b> defence of Kamarja was celebrated in Arabic literature, but the Arab hold over the region was broken after the Battle of the Defile two years later. It was only following the collapse of the Turgesh khaganate after 738 that the Arabs re-established their rule over Transoxiana.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division, the ROK II Corps was devastated, and {{effectively}} ceased to be an organized fighting force. This meant the right flank of the US Eighth Army was completely open to the Chinese forces, which were now advancing south to overwhelm the UN forces. Exploiting the situation, the Chinese launched another attack on the now exposed Eighth Army center, resulting in {{the loss of}} the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment and the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of Unsan. With the Chinese forces pouring into the rear of the UN lines, the Eighth Army was forced to retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. Only <b>the</b> <b>stubborn</b> defense of Kunu-ri by the US 5th Regimental Combat Team and the ROK 7th Infantry Division on November 4 managed to stop the Chinese advance and prevented a disastrous defeat for the Eighth Army. By November 5, logistics difficulties forced the Chinese to end the First Phase Campaign.|$|E

5|$|Before the battle, {{a section}} from the 2 RAR Medium Machine Gun Platoon had been {{stationed}} within the American perimeter near Hill 111 to provide covering fire across {{the area between}} the positions occupied by the US Marines and the Australians. Commanded by Sergeant Brian Cooper they soon found themselves {{in the thick of}} the fighting, firing their Vickers machine-guns in support of the Australian positions and to defend themselves from the weight of the Chinese main attack which fell on the Marines. Three men were wounded during the night but the machine-gunners continued to fire in support, while the remainder of the section repelled Chinese assaults from the left. Ultimately the Chinese were unable to dislodge them, with the Australians calling-in artillery on to their own positions during repeated Chinese attempts to overrun them as the US Marines withdrew past their position, leaving them isolated. When dawn came dozens of Chinese bodies were found strewn in front of the Australian machine-gunners. As the US Marines worked to clear the Chinese stragglers from their position the Australians had endeavoured to coax a Chinese soldier from a bunker, yet when he resisted they were forced to kill him with a grenade. Cooper was later awarded the Military Medal for his leadership, with <b>the</b> <b>stubborn</b> defence of the Australians contributing to the break-up of the Chinese attack which at one stage had threatened to overrun the Marine position. Large groups of Chinese remained though, occupying a number bunkers and trenches, and they were not finally dislodged by the Marines until the following afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the heavy}} North Korean losses {{during the initial}} UN attacks, Almond again ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to {{recapture}} Wonju on January 9. About four infantry battalions from the US 23rd and 38th Infantry Regiment supported by French and Dutch troops advanced toward Wonju on January 9, yet the attack was stalled at Hill 247 due to the cold weather {{and the lack of}} air support. As the UN forces tried to dislodge the North Koreans the next day, they were met by six defending North Korean battalions with an estimated strength of 7,000 soldiers. Under a heavy snowstorm and with no air support, the battle for Hill 247 continued for most of January 10, and the fighting around the French Battalion of the 23rd Infantry Regiment became particularly fierce. At one point, the French Battalion was forced to fend off several North Korean counterattacks with bayonet charges after running out of ammunition. The French Battalion's action at Wonju impressed Ridgway, who later encouraged all American units in Korea to utilize bayonets in battle. The North Koreans tried to encircle the attacking UN forces as the latter began to gain the upper hand, however artillery fire broke up the North Korean formations, and they had suffered an estimated 2,000 casualties {{in the aftermath of the}} battle. When air support returned on January 11, the attacking UN forces inflicted another 1,100 North Korean casualties and captured Hill 247 by January 12. Although the cold weather and <b>the</b> <b>stubborn</b> North Korean defenses prevented the UN forces from entering Wonju, the capture of Hill 247 had put all of Wonju within UN artillery range, and the village soon became a no man's land under the devastating bombardment.|$|E
