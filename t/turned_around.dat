40|$|Application Service Maintenance Projects {{normally}} {{deals with}} Incidents as First Level support function. Incidents in majority directly link with Production Environment, so <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents {{is a significant}} factor. Many Companies are having Service Level Agreements with Customer for <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents. There {{is a need to}} focus on Estimating and Predicting <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents. Improvement in <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time helps in improving the Service Level Agreements earlier agreed with the Customer. Saved time can be diverted to other Project Activities like Enhancements or for new requests. This will also helps as one of the paths for Companies to get new business with the Customer. We have used Capability Maturity Model Integration(CMMI) V 1. 2 Quantitative Project Management(QPM) methodology for Application Service Maintenance(ASM) Projects for estimating and predicting <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> time for incidents. By implementing this best practice in SEI CMMI Level 5 Company we have achieved a significant improvement of approximately 50 percent reduction in Average <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for incidents. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{other major}} fire {{located in the}} {{northern}} section of the park was the Hellroaring fire.

5|$|Between 1904 and 1908, one of {{the main}} service {{patterns}} was the West Side Branch, running from Lower Manhattan to Van Cortlandt Park via what is now the Lexington Avenue, 42nd Street, and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines. There were both local and express services with express trains south of 96th Street. Some express trains ran to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn via the Joralemon Street Tunnel during rush hours while all other trains <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> at City Hall or South Ferry.|$|E
5|$|Mike McCarthy, New Orleans' {{offensive}} coordinator, Herman Edwards, a Tampa Bay assistant coach, and Marvin Lewis, Baltimore's defensive coordinator, {{were mentioned}} as possible replacements for Palmer.

50|$|Upon {{leaving the}} station, trains make a slight left hand turn, {{followed}} by a straight segment of track. This leads into another left hand turn and trains then climb the 100 ft lift hill. At the top, the track drops at a 53-degree angle. The maximum speed may vary between 50 and 55 miles per hour (80 and 88km/h) depending on the weather conditions, time of day and the load. Next the train rises into a right hand <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> This <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> leads to a sharp second drop, before rising over another hill, and passing through a left hand second <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> The second <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> has a double down element as riders descend another drop into the wooden structure. The ride makes another out and back run, and after the final <b>turn</b> <b>around,</b> hits the brake run, ending the ride.|$|R

After waiting in the rain awhile for orders, the Engineer company <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> {{and went back to}} camp.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{that something was}} wrong at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, and drove to the bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was John Cena against Edge, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels in a Fatal Four-Way {{match for the}} WWE Championship.

Near the end, Orton attempted to RKO Cena, but was pushed into Edge, making Edge Spear Orton. Cena then performed an FU to Edge. When Cena <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> Michaels superkicked Cena, who landed on Orton for the pinfall victory, retaining the title.|$|E

5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> dramatically.|$|E
5|$|After {{she earned}} her degrees, Pritzker joined the Pritzker {{organization}} encouraged by her cousin Nick Pritzker. In 1987, she founded Classic Residence by Hyatt, later renamed Vi, upscale housing for seniors {{as an alternative}} to nursing homes. The project struggled at first, losing $40million in the first 18months, but <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> after changes in marketing and management. In 1991, Jay Pritzker, Penny's uncle and head of the Pritzker family businesses, named Penny {{as the director of the}} Pritzkers' non-hotel landholdings. With that appointment, Penny created the Pritzker Realty Group, which developed apartment buildings, shopping centers, and the Baldwin Park neighborhood in Orlando, Florida.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E

5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about two miles from the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E

Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them.
