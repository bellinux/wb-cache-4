25|$|If {{a patient}} doesn't want a {{healthcare}} worker to share confidential health information, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this clear {{and discuss the}} matter with healthcare staff.

In 2006, AIDSmeds.com merged with POZ, a publication for people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Staley is still with the merged organization as a blogger and advisory editor.|$|E

2500|$|Although bear viewing {{is often}} {{considered}} a [...] "nonconsumptive" [...] use, {{it can have}} serious impacts on bear populations {{if it is not}} conducted properly. Most viewing occurs at places where bears congregate because of feeding opportunities that are critical to their survival. If some bears avoid these areas because people are there, those bears may not get the fat and protein <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it through the upcoming winter. Consequently, unmanaged bear viewing could affect several bears, especially productive sows with cubs.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{published}} in 2003 by Joseph DiMasi and colleagues estimated an {{average cost of}} approximately $800 million to bring a new drug to market, while a 2006 study estimated the cost to be anywhere from $500 million to $2 billion. The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, using a different methodology, estimated the average cost for development to be under $200 million, about 29% of which is spent on FDA-required clinical trials. DiMasi rejects the claim that high R costs alone are responsible for high drug prices. Instead, in a published letter, DiMasi writes, [...] "...longer development times increase R costs and shorten the period during which drug companies can earn the returns <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> investment financially viable. Other things being equal, longer development times reduce innovation incentives. As a consequence, fewer new therapies might be developed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Health {{advocacy}} encompasses direct {{service to}} the individual or family as well as activities that promote health and {{access to health care}} in communities and the larger public. [...] Advocates support and promote the rights of the patient in the health care arena, help build capacity to improve community health and enhance health policy initiatives focused on available, safe and quality care. Health advocates are best suited to address the challenge of patient-centered care in our complex healthcare system. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines patient-centered care as: Health care that establishes a partnership among practitioners, patients, and their families (when appropriate) to ensure that decisions respect patients’ wants, needs, and preferences and that patients have the education and support <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> decisions and participate in their own care. Patient-centered care {{is also one of the}} overreaching goals of health advocacy, in addition to safer medical systems, and greater patient involvement in healthcare delivery and design.|$|E

2500|$|The tools {{needed to}} make beats in the late 1970s were funk, soul, and other music genre records, record turntables, DJ mixers, audio consoles, and {{relatively}} inexpensive Portastudio-style multitrack recording devices. In the 1980s and 1990s, beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed, suchas samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and synthesizers. From the 1970s to the 2010s, various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments, such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks. To record the finished beats or beat tracks, beatmakers and producers {{use a variety of}} sound recording equipment, typically multitrack recorders. Digital Audio Workstations, also known as DAWs, became more common in the 2010s for producers. Some of the most used DAWs are Fruity Loops Studio, Ableton Live, and Pro Tools. DAWs have made it possible for more {{people to be able to}} make beats in their own home studio, without going to a recording studio. Beatmakers who own DAWs do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the 1980s (huge 72 channel audio consoles, multitrack recorders, racks of rackmount effects units), because 2010-era DAWs have everything <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ...|$|E
