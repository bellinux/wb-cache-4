25|$|The wild vine, the {{forerunner of}} the {{cultivated}} Vitis vinifera {{is known to have}} grown on upper Rhine back to historic time, and it is possible (but not documented) that Roman-era German viticulture was started using local varieties. Many viticultural practices were however taken {{from other parts of the}} Roman empire, as evidenced by Roman-style <b>trellising</b> systems surviving into the 18th century in some parts of Germany, such as the Kammerbau in the Palatinate.|$|E
25|$|Works of {{classical}} Roman writers—most notably Cato, Columella, Horace, Palladius, Pliny, Varro and Virgil—shed {{light on the}} role of wine in Roman culture as well as contemporary winemaking and viticultural practices. Some of these influential techniques can be found in modern winemaking. These include the consideration of climate and landscape in deciding which grape varieties to plant, the benefits of different <b>trellising</b> and vine-training systems, the effects of pruning and harvest yields on the quality of wine, as well as winemaking techniques such as sur lie aging after fermentation and the maintenance of sanitary practices throughout the winemaking process to avoid contamination, impurities and spoilage.|$|E
25|$|From the cordon, plant shoots {{emerge from}} the bud that {{eventually}} develops mature bark and becomes the fruiting cane from which grape clusters will emerge. These canes can be positioned and trained to whatever angle is desired by the grower. Typically, they are positioned upwards {{but they can be}} bent into an arch such as a Pendelbogen or Mosel arch system, or trained to point downwards such as the Scott Henry and Sylvos system. The latter method requires more labor-intensive <b>trellising</b> and training for Vitis vinifera vines which are naturally more inclined to grow upwards rather than down. In systems such as the Scott Henry, this downward growth is achieved by the use of movable wires that first allow the canes to grow upwards until about 2 to 3 weeks before harvest when they are then shifted downwards where the weight of gravity on the hanging grape clusters helps keep the canes pointing down.|$|E

2500|$|While closely related, {{the terms}} <b>trellising,</b> pruning and vine {{training}} {{are often used}} interchangeably even though they refer to different things. Technically speaking, the trellis refers to the actual stakes, posts, wires or other structures that the grapevine is attached to. Some vines are allowed to grow free standing without any attachment to a <b>trellising</b> structure. Part of the confusion between <b>trellising</b> and vine training systems {{stems from the fact}} that vine training systems will often take on the name of the particular type of <b>trellising</b> involved. [...] Pruning refers to the cutting and shaping of the cordon or [...] "arms" [...] of the grapevine in winter which will determine the number of buds that are allowed to become grape clusters. In some wine regions, such as France, the exact number of buds is outlined by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations. During the summer growing season, pruning can involve removing young plant shoots or excess bunches of grapes with green harvesting. Vine training systems utilize the practice of <b>trellising</b> and pruning in order to dictate and control a grape vine's canopy which will influence not only the potential yield of that year's crop but also the quality of the grapes due to the access of air and sunlight needed for the grapes to ripen fully and for preventing various grape diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Within these larger classifications, {{the vine}} {{training}} {{system may be}} further distinguished by the canopy such as whether it is free (like goblet) or constrained by shoot positioning along wires (such as VSP <b>trellising)</b> and whether it includes a single curtain (Guyot) or double (Lyre). For cordon and many other spur trained systems, they {{could be described as}} unilateral (utilizing only 1 arm or cordon) or bilateral with both arms extending from the trunk. Two other classifications, based on <b>trellising,</b> are whether or not the vine is [...] "staked" [...] with an external support structure and the number of wires used in the <b>trellising.</b> Vines may be individual staked either permanently, as many vineyards along the bank of the Rhone Valley which are at risk of wind damage, or temporarily as some young vines are to provide extra support. Within a trellis system fruiting canes and young shoots are attached to wires strung out across the rows. The number of wires used (one, two, three) {{and whether or not they}} are movable (such as the Scott Henry) will influence the size of the canopy and the yield.|$|E
2500|$|Pruning {{has become}} less strenuous and {{time-consuming}} since the introduction of electric and pneumatic secateurs. The cuttings produced by pruning are shredded to form a mulch or burnt in situ. [...] Pruning and <b>trellising</b> are the only tasks that wine-growers still carry out completely by hand.|$|E

2500|$|The high {{humidity}} and propensity for harvest rains leads many growers to use open canopy management techniques and <b>trellising</b> {{as well as}} frequent leaf pulling {{in order to keep}} mould and rot at bay. Some examples of vine training systems found in the Hunter including the Scott Henry, Smart-Dyson and V-Trellis. In the Upper Hunter, the Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP) is often used in areas that have problem with sunburn. [...] Despite the generally wet climate, irrigation is often used in the slightly drier Upper Hunter where the winter and early growing seasons are prone to drought.|$|E
2500|$|Cordons {{are trained}} in either a {{unilateral}} (one arm) or bilateral (two arms) fashion with the latter resembling the letter [...] "T". The cordons of grapevines are most commonly trained horizontally along wires as in the Lyre and Scott Henry systems. However, notable exceptions do exist, such as the [...] "V" [...] and [...] "Y" [...] trellis systems which elevate the cordon to various angles that resemble their namesake letter. Note that vertical <b>trellising</b> systems, such as the VSP system often used in New Zealand, refer to the vertical orientation of the fruit canes in an upward manner and not the cordon [...] "arms" [...] of the vines.|$|E
2500|$|Columella {{describes}} the boiling of grape must in a lead vessel to concentrate sugars {{and at the}} same time allow the lead to impart sweetness and desirable texture to the wine, a practice that may have contributed to lead poisoning. [...] He presented precise details on how a well-run vineyard should operate, from the optimum breakfast for slaves to the yield of grapes from each jugerum of land and the pruning practices to ensure those yields. Many modern elements of vine training and <b>trellising</b> are evident in Columella's description of best practices. In his ideal vineyard, vines were planted two paces apart and fastened with willow withies to chestnut stakes about the height of a man. He also describes some of the wines of Roman provinces, noting the potential of wines from Spain and the Bordeaux region. Additionally, Columella lauds the quality of wines made from the ancient grape varieties Balisca and Biturica, believed by ampelographers to be ancestral to the Cabernet family.|$|E

2500|$|Drafted in 1973, the [...] "Wine of Origin" [...] (WO) {{programme}} legislates how wine {{regions of}} South Africa are defined and can appear on wine labels. While {{some aspects of}} the WO are taken from the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) system, the WO is concerned primarily with accuracy in labelling and does not place any additional regulations on wine regions such as permitted varieties, <b>trellising</b> methods, irrigation and crop yields. Wine regions under the WO system fall under one of four categories - the largest and most generic are geographical units (such as the Western Cape region) which include the smaller, but still largely defined regions (such as Overberg), followed by districts (like Walker Bay) and then finally wards (such as Elgin). The Eastern Cape province is South Africa's most recent wine region. While geographical units, regions and districts are largely defined by political boundaries - wards are the level of origin designation that is most defined by unique terroir characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in most of}} Italy, native vines are {{abundant}} in the land that the Ancient Greeks called Oenotrua (meaning [...] "land of vines") and was subsequently cultivated by the Romans. With its close proximity, France {{has been a significant}} viticultural influence on the region, particularly Burgundy, which is evident today in the varietal styles of most Piedmontese wines with very little blending. One of the earliest mention of Piedmontese wines occurred in the 14th century when the Italian agricultural writer Pietro de Crescentius wrote his Liber Ruralium Commodorum. He noted the efforts of the Piedmontese to make [...] "Greek style" [...] sweet wines by twisting the stems of the grapes clusters and letting them hang longer on the vine to dry out. He also noted the changes with <b>trellising</b> in the region with more vines being staked close to the grounds rather than cultivated high among trees in the manner more common to Italian viticulture at the time. In the 17th century, the court jeweller of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy earned broad renown for his pale red Chiaretto made entirely from the Nebbiolo grape.|$|E
2500|$|Historically {{vineyards}} in South Africa {{were planted}} with untrellised bush vines planted [...] apart at a density of 7,000 vines per hectare (2,800 vines per acre). Following the phylloxera devastation, {{the focus of}} viticulture in South Africa was more on quantity rather than quality. Vineyards were planted with high yield varieties, widely spaced to facilitate the use of mechanical harvesting. In the late 20th century, more producers {{began to focus on}} quality wine production and adopted modern viticultural practices. Vines were planted to an average density of 3,300 per hectare (1,300 per acre) and pruned to keep yields down to 49–56 hl/ha [...] (2.8–3.2 tons/acre). The most common form of <b>trellising</b> found in South Africa is the vertical hedge row system that uses a split cordon supported on a wire kept around [...] off the ground. The grapevine leaves are trained upright on separate wires that allow plenty of sunshine to reach the grapes, but provide enough coverage to keep them from being sunburned. The vines are usually pruned to allow four to five spurs each with two to three buds (potential grape clusters) per cordon. Heat is also a concern come harvest time with some wineries harvesting only at night in the cooler temperatures under floodlights.|$|E

60|$|As {{he walked}} away toward his hotel he amused himself with the {{conjecture}} whether he, with his forty-one years and his hundred and eighty five pounds, were not still a pathetic and even a romantic figure to this pretty and kindly woman, who probably imagined him as heart-broken as ever. He was very willing {{to see more of}} her, if she wished; but with the rain beginning to fall more thick and chill in the darkening street, he could have postponed their next meeting till a pleasanter evening without great self-denial. He felt a little twinge of rheumatism in his shoulder when he got into his room, for your room in a Florentine hotel is always some degrees colder than outdoors, unless you have fire in it; and with the sun shining on his windows when he went out after lunch, it had seemed to Colville ridiculous to have his morning fire kept up. The sun was what he had taken the room for. It was in it, the landlord assured him, from ten in the morning till four in the afternoon; and so, in fact, it was, when it shone; but even then it was not fully in it, but had a trick of looking in at the sides of the window, and painting the chamber wall with a delusive glow. Colville raked away the ashes of his fire-place, and throwing on two or three fagots of broom and pine sprays, he had a blaze that would be very pretty to dress by after dinner, but that gave out no warmth for the present. He left it, and went down to the reading-room, as it was labelled over the door, in homage to a predominance of English-speaking people among the guests; but there was no fire there; that was kindled only by request, and he shivered at the bare aspect of the apartment, with its cold piano, its locked bookcases, and its table, where the London Times, the Neue Freie Presse of Vienna, and the Italie of Rome exposed their titles, one just beyond the margin of the other. He turned from the door and went into the dining-room, where the stove was ostentatiously roaring over its small logs and its lozenges of peat, But even here the fire had been so recently lighted that the warmth was potential rather than actual. By stooping down before the stove, and pressing his shoulder against its brass doors, Colville managed to lull his enemy, while he studied the figures of the woman-headed, woman-breasted hounds developing into vines and foliage that covered the frescoed <b>trellising</b> of the quadrangularly vaulted ceiling. The waiters, in their veteran dress-coats, were putting the final touches to the table, and the sound of voices outside the door obliged Colville to get up. The effort involved made him still more reluctant about going out to Mrs. Bowen's.|$|E
