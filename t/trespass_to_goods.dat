5|$|Trespass in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into three groups: {{trespass}} to the person, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> and trespass to land.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E

The [...] "trespass" [...] can be as little as touching or moving the goods, given the right circumstances. It is unknown whether intention is required for a claim under <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods,</b> as the matter has never gone to court; the courts have confirmed that for damages to be awarded for harm suffered, the harm must have been reasonably foreseeable.|$|E

500|$|<b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> {{is defined}} as [...] "wrongful {{physical}} interference with goods {{that are in the}} possession of another". It is covered not only by the common law, but also by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which was written to clear up the confusing rules on <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> which had evolved over the centuries. It is similar to the tort of conversion, which covers the interference with goods in a way which is inconsistent with the rights of the owner. [...] "Physical interference" [...] is usually the taking or destroying of goods, but can be as minor as touching or moving them in the right circumstances. In Kirk v Gregory, the defendant moved jewellery from one room to another, where it was stolen.

[...] "Possession" [...] has the standard legal meaning, referring to the claimant's right to use, control or deal with the item. This can include owners, but also bailees.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of trespass, {{the first of which}} is <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person. Whether intent is a {{necessary}} element of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person varies by jurisdiction. Under English decision, Letang v Cooper, intent is required <b>to</b> sustain a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person cause of action; in the absence of intent, negligence is the appropriate tort. In other jurisdictions, gross negligence is sufficient <b>to</b> sustain a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person, such as when a defendant negligently operates an automobile and strikes the plaintiff with great force. [...] "Intent is to be presumed from the act itself." [...] Generally, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person consists of three torts: assault, battery, and false imprisonment.|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} this case was that an action for {{trespass}} to the person can now only be brought for intentional torts, such as assault, battery, false imprisonment, trespass to land or chattels, etc. A claimant wishing to recover damages to his person or property that were caused by the defendant's negligent action must prove {{all the elements of}} the tort of negligence. However the decision did not affect actions for <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods.</b> conversion is still a strict liability tort under English law, and recover does not depend upon establishing negligence.|$|E
5000|$|Trespass to chattels, {{also known}} as <b>{{trespass}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> or trespass to personal property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property … proximately causing injury". Trespass to chattel {{does not require a}} showing of damages. Simply the [...] "intermeddling with or use of … the personal property" [...] of another gives cause of action for trespass. Since CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, various courts have applied the principles of trespass to chattel to resolve cases involving unsolicited bulk e-mail and unauthorized server usage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{action on}} the case for negligence, the rapid {{expansion}} of which is traced to Donoghue v Stevenson 1932. The tort of negligence {{lies at the heart of}} the modern law of tort, which also includes obligations enforced via the old actions of <b>trespass</b> (<b>to</b> the person, <b>to</b> <b>goods,</b> and <b>to</b> land), actions on the case, conversion, deceit, and defamation.|$|R

5|$|The general {{principle}} {{is that a}} <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person must be a direct and intentional act, while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of negligence is more appropriate, as established in Letang v Cooper.

5000|$|Trespass to chattels, {{also known}} as <b>{{trespass}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> or trespass to personal property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property...proximately causing injury". While originally a remedy for the asportation of personal property, the tort grew to incorporate any interference with the personal property of another. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, trespass to chattels has been codified to clearly define {{the scope of the}} remedy; in most jurisdictions, trespass to chattel remains a purely common law remedy, the scope of which varies by jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|In summary, the {{decision}} established that applying a wheel clamp to a vehicle constitutes a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> {{and that the}} onus remains with the clamper {{to demonstrate that the}} person parking the vehicle knew of the risks and happily took these on {{at the time that he}} parked the vehicle. Although it might reasonably be inferred that a motorist saw and understood the signs as a result of their numbers, size and location it was insufficient that an appellant had simply had the opportunity to see warning signs but that they must also have read and understood them and only then, by doing so, could they consent to the act of clamping if they parked in contravention to the notices.|$|E
2500|$|In sum, {{the basic}} {{elements}} of a claim of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent <b>to</b> the <b>trespass,</b> 2) interference or intermeddling with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions.

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} Ripstein and Dan-Cohen's {{critiques of}} the 'harm principle'. Ripstein and Dan-Cohen have {{asserted that the}} harm principle should be jettisoned, because it allegedly fails to provide a rationale for criminalising certain harmless wrongs {{that ought to be}} criminalised. They argue that Kant's second formulation of the categorical imperative and his concept of 'external freedom' are better equipped for ensuring that criminalisation decisions meet the requirements of fairness. Per contra, I assert that Kant's deontological theory is about identifying morally wrongful and rightful conduct: it does not tell the legislature which of those wrongs justify a criminal law response in accordance with the requirements of fairness and justice. Some wrongdoers deserve censure and the stigma that results from criminalisation, but others do not. Kant's deontological theory does not limit the scope of the criminal law merely to those wrongs that deserve a criminal law response. Fair and principled criminalisation requires more than mere wrongdoing. I assert that it is only fair to criminalise wrongs when further normative reasons can be invoked to justify the use of the criminal law as a means for deterring the unwanted conduct. While 'harm to others' is not the only normative reason {{that can be used to}} demonstrate that it is fair to criminalise a given act, it is the justification that has the greatest reach. It would not be fair to criminalise mere wrongdoing (that is, every violation of freedom: <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> etc. or every violation of the categorical imperative: every false promise etc.). Nor is it possible to distinguish one violation of freedom from the next, as freedom is not measurable. Thus, murder and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> would be equally wrong and equally criminalisable in Kant's scheme. A further problem with Dan-Cohen's use of the second formulation of Kant's categorical imperative is that it aims to be an inclusive criterion for identifying conduct that is prima facie criminalisable, but this inclusive approach does not explain the wrongfulness (or in Dan-Cohen's use of the categorical imperative the criminalisableness) of harming animals. In this paper, I demonstrate that the harm principle is able to meet the challenges raised by Ripstein and Dan-Cohen. I also demonstrate that it offers superior criteria for ensuring that criminalisation decisions are fair, just and principled than is offered by Kant's deontological theory...|$|E
40|$|Claims against {{police for}} {{psychiatric}} injury suffered {{as a consequence}} of conduct of investigations and performance of duties* 1. 	Introduction In 2002, McCullough and Palmer published a report to the Criminology Research Council, Civil Litigation by citizens against Australian police between 1994 and 2002. The introduction to the report says: "There appears to be an emerging trend towards greater resort to civil litigation against police, combined with a definite trend to substantially larger judgements in favour of plaintiffs. Judicial benevolence towards questionable police practices has diminished and successful civil actions against the police are on the increase (Dixon 1997 : 146). According to the Australian Torts Reporter, 'police are now, as never before, becoming targets of civil actions against them by aggrieved citizens' (2000 35 - 070 : 43, 072) ". As to why the number of claims against police has been increasing, the researchers conclude: "There are a number of factors underlying the increasing significance of civil litigation. All interviewees agreed that greater access to justice through 'no win, no fee' arrangements, increased awareness about rights amongst community members, greater damages awards, and the snowball effect of publicity about successful actions contribute to the increased resort to civil litigation by aggrieved citizens. However, lawyers tended to characterise any increase in civil litigation positively in terms of greater access to justice, and public good in terms of enhanced police accountability, whereas police tended to emphasise the negative impact of litigation in terms of police morale and the drain on public funds. Lawyers linked resort to civil litigation to what they perceived to be lack of effective alternative means of police accountability, while police employees saw no or little connection between other accountability mechanisms and civil litigation, and expressed concern that police were any ‘easy target’ often being sued for 'just doing their job'. " The researchers investigated various civil actions in tort against police officers including breach of statutory duty, malicious prosecution, assault, battery and trespass to the person, trespass to land, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>goods,</b> Lord Campbell's action, misfeasance in public office, false imprisonment, false arrest, intimidation and negligence. In this paper it is proposed to limit the discussion to a consideration of recent claims against the police which have been brought in negligence and trespass to the person (assault, battery and false imprisonment) ...|$|E
