5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Christians.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins as}} Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, {{and his wife}} Sumartini (Tini), {{residents}} of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a marital breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving no {{time for him to}} be with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work.|$|E
5|$|Between 1158–1162, {{a series}} of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm {{resulted}} in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do {{as part of his}} treaty obligations, Manuel decided that it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Turks once and for all. Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya). Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.|$|E

50|$|Claude de L'Aubespine (1510-1567) was Sebastien's {{brother and}} baron of Chateauneuf-sur-Cher.

5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
5|$|Judah Benjamin {{was sworn}} in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues {{included}} Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> plantation business.|$|E
5|$|Seward was an expansionist, {{and sought}} {{opportunities}} to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) {{as a financial}} liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, {{only to be told}} there was no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.|$|E

5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford to take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E

25|$|Repeatedly, McGee {{called for}} a summer recess, and each time the idea split the Senate along generational lines.

Senators had plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> home-state business and reelection campaigns.

25|$|The first {{plans for}} a bridge across the Derwent River {{had been made in}} 1832, but the width and depth of the river, {{combined}} with the powerful currents, proved to be too much of a deterrent for then current construction materials and techniques. A solution was hit upon to create a pontoon bridge, and in 1943, the Hobart Bridge was opened, spanning the Derwent River for the first <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the perceived problem of upriver shipping access, a lifting span was added near the western landing that allowed quite large vessels to pass through.|$|E

If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life.
