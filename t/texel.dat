5|$|The Battle off <b>Texel,</b> {{also known}} as the Action off <b>Texel</b> or the Action of 17 October 1914, was a naval battle off the coast of the Dutch island of <b>Texel</b> during the First World War. A British squadron, {{comprising}} one light cruiser and four destroyers on a routine patrol, encountered the German 7th Half Flotilla of torpedo boats which was en route to the British coast to lay mines. The British forces attacked, and the outgunned German force attempted to flee and then fought a desperate and ineffective action against the British force, which sank all four German boats.|$|E
5|$|Halstead {{brought his}} prizes back to Britain, where both Argo and Mercury were {{purchased}} for service by the Royal Navy as HMS Janus and HMS Hermes respectively as {{both of the}} Batavian names were already in use by the Royal Navy. British losses in the engagement were one man killed and three wounded, all suffered on Phoenix during the engagement with Argo. Apart from the losses in that exchange, no other casualties, either British or Batavian were reported. The action was the only significant engagement fought off the Batavian coast during 1796 as Duncan's force kept the main Batavian fleet contained within its anchorage in the <b>Texel.</b> In October 1797 however the main Batavian fleet was able to break out and sail on a raiding cruise towards the English coast. Duncan intercepted the fleet on its return to the <b>Texel</b> and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Batavians on 11 October at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|On hearing Donnelly's report, Duncan {{immediately}} despatched a small squadron to {{the mouth}} of the <b>Texel</b> to wait for the arrival of the Batavian squadron. Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36gun frigate HMS Phoenix, accompanied by Pegasus, Sylph and the 50gun fourth rate HMS Leopard. The squadron detached at 05:00 and almost immediately the Batavian squadron was sighted to the southeast, heading for the entrance to the <b>Texel,</b> tacking against the northwest wind. Halstead's force was not unified, with Pegasus and Sylph far ahead of Phoenix and Leopard, and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces, the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly's command and Halstead's rear force attacking the frigate Argo. Duncan's main fleet, some distance behind Halstead, also sighted the Batavian squadron and joined the chase.|$|E

5|$|The {{departure}} of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the Batavian ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland, losing sight of them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly guessed the Batavian force's destination, and ordered Sylph to separate, the two vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the Batavian squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the <b>Texel</b> but without having located the Batavian squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships were off the Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the <b>Texel</b> anchorage.|$|E

5|$|Returning {{from his}} long convalescence, Hope was again {{requested}} by Duncan and commanded his flagship HMS Kent {{for the next}} three years. In 1799, the Kent was Duncan's flagship in supporting the Anglo-Russian invasion of the Batavian Republic, with Hope being present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in <b>Texel</b> to the Royal Navy. Sent to Britain with the dispatches proclaiming the surrender, Hope was lauded by both the British and Russian courts, King George III presenting him with £500 and Tsar Paul I making him a Commander of the Order of St John.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Understanding texture {{regularity}} in real {{images is}} a challenging computer vision task. We propose a higher-order feature matching algorithm {{to discover the}} lattices of near-regular textures in real images. The underlying lattice of a near-regular texture identifies all of the <b>texels</b> {{as well as the}} global topology among the <b>texels.</b> A key contribution {{of this paper is to}} formulate lattice-finding as a correspondence problem. The algorithm finds a plausible lattice by iteratively proposing <b>texels</b> and assigning neighbors between the <b>texels.</b> Our matching algorithm seeks assignments that maximize both pair-wise visual similarity and higher-order geometric consistency. We approximate the optimal assignment using a recently developed spectral method. We successfully discover the lattices of a diverse set of unsegmented, real-world textures with significant geometric warping and large appearance variation among <b>texels.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many breeds, {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the <b>Texel,</b> a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{participated in}} a fleet advance into the North Sea from 29 until 31 May which ended without combat. The ship covered a minelaying {{operation}} on 11–12 September off <b>Texel.</b> Another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23–24 October. Grosser Kurfürst ended the year with a two-week training cruise in the Baltic, which lasted from 5 to 20 December. Another round of exercises in the Baltic followed on 18–23 January 1916. Grosser Kurfürst went into drydock in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance on 12 February. Work lasted until 3 March; two days later the ship sailed for a sweep into the Hoofden, though this again failed to encounter any British forces. The fleet conducted another sortie on 23 March to the Amrun Bank, followed by another a month later to Horns Reef on 21–22 April.|$|E
5|$|In his frigate HMS Phoenix, Halstead {{was able}} to cut the Batavian frigate Argo off from the shore {{and bring it to}} battle, forcing it to {{surrender}} in just 20 minutes as other British ships closed with the combat. The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan's fleet, pursued by the frigate HMS Pegasus and brig-sloop HMS Sylph. After a lengthy chase, Phoenix caught the cutter Duke of York, Sylph seized the brig Mercury, while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs, Echo and Gier ashore, where both were believed wrecked. Duncan's blockade of the <b>Texel</b> was instrumental in British control of the North Sea, and a year later it would achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the time, when {{drawing a}} {{textured}} shape on the screen, the texture is not displayed {{exactly as it}} is stored, without any distortion. Because of this, most pixels will end up needing to use a point on the texture that is [...] "between" [...] <b>texels</b> - assuming the <b>texels</b> are points (as opposed to, say, squares) - in the middle (or on the upper left corner, or anywhere else; it does not matter, {{as long as it}} is consistent) of their respective [...] "cells". Bilinear filtering uses these points to perform bilinear interpolation between the four <b>texels</b> nearest to the point that the pixel represents (in the middle or upper left of the pixel, usually).|$|R
5|$|Meermin {{was built}} {{for use as a}} slave ship in the VOC's African trade; between 1658 and 1799 the VOC {{acquired}} and transported 63,000slaves to its Cape Colony, now part of South Africa. The ship began her maiden voyage at <b>Texel,</b> an island off the coast of what is now the Netherlands, on 21January 1761, with a crew of 62 under the command of Captain Hendrik Worms; she arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 15June. Although fitted out as a slave ship, vessels such as the Meermin routinely carried other goods when not transporting slaves.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 12 May 1796 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and a frigate and four smaller ships of the Navy of the Batavian Republic. The British squadron had been detached on the previous day from the British North Sea fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan, which was cruising off the Batavian fleet anchorage at the <b>Texel,</b> while the Batavian squadron was returning to the Netherlands from the Norwegian coast {{where it had been}} sheltering since suffering defeat at the Action of 22 August 1795 the previous year. As the Batavian squadron neared the Batavian coast, the British squadron under Captain Lawrence Halstead attacked.|$|E
5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the <b>Texel</b> with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E

5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the Dutch had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} Dutch coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on its way back to the <b>Texel.</b> The Dutch formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was conducted in a confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the Dutch fleet, overwhelming each in turn and capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving Dutch prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to aim at the hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E
5|$|HMS Esk was an E-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. She {{was designed to be}} easily converted into a fast minelayer by removing some guns and her torpedo tubes. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36, during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Esk was converted to a minelayer when World War II began in September 1939, and spent most of her time laying mines. During the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940, the ship laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters before the Germans invaded, but was recalled to home waters to resume her minelaying duties in early May. During one such sortie, Esk was sunk during the <b>Texel</b> Disaster on the night of 31 August 1940, when she ran into a newly laid German minefield.|$|E
5|$|König {{participated in}} a fleet advance into the North Sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 May. She was then briefly {{assigned}} to picket duty in the German defensive belt. The ship again ran aground on 6 July, though damage was minimal. The ship supported a minelaying operation on 11–12 September off <b>Texel.</b> Another fleet advance followed on 23–24 October; after returning, König went into drydock for maintenance, rejoining the fleet by 4 November. The ship was then {{sent back to the}} Baltic for more training on 5–20 December. On the return voyage, she was slightly damaged after grounding in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal during a snow storm. König was in the Baltic on 17 January 1916 for further training, then on 24 January returned to the North Sea. Two fleet advances followed on 5–6 March and 21–22 April.|$|E

5|$|Later in August, the Germans set {{up another}} ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as {{had been the}} {{original}} intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart {{late in the day}} on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, UB-6 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, UB-6 was stationed off <b>Texel</b> by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, UB-6 and her group played no part in the action.|$|E
5|$|The English {{plan for}} 1673 centred on first {{achieving}} naval dominance, followed by landing an army in Zeeland. The King appointed the Duke as supreme commander, with Rupert as his deputy, combining {{the rank of}} General and Vice Admiral of England. During the winter of 1672, however, Charles—still (legitimately) childless—decided that the risk to the Duke, his heir, was too great and made Rupert supreme Allied commander in his place. Rupert began the 1673 campaign against the Dutch knowing the logistical support for his fleet remained uncertain, with many ships undermanned. The result was the Battle of Schooneveld in June and the Battle of <b>Texel</b> in August, a controversial sequence of engagements in which, at a minimum, poor communications between the French and English commanders assisted the marginal Dutch victory. Many English commentators were harsher, blaming the French for failing to fully engage in the battles and Rupert—having cautioned against the alliance in the first place—was popularly hailed as a hero. Rupert finally retired from active seagoing command later that year.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the look of}} the Infected, the art team cycled through various iterations. Some early ideas included the Infected looking like aliens or zombies. The final design was chosen when lead character artist Michael Knowland incorporated images of diseases and fungal growth onto a human. He expressed the difficulty in changing the art from 2D to 3D, which would allow viewing from different angles. The process of sending completed concept art to the lighting and visual effects artists, who re-create the art within the game's engine. Due to the lack of artificial light sources in the game's world, the team was forced to work with natural light. To achieve high quality lighting, they used lightmaps. The use of lightmaps led to various problems, such as the discontinuities in the lighting; this was fixed by slightly modifying the <b>texel</b> intensities. When characters were added to scenes, they initially looked out of place; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this.|$|E
50|$|Trilinear {{filtering}} {{still has}} weaknesses, because the pixel is still assumed {{to take up}} a square area on the texture. In particular, when a texture is at a steep angle compared to the camera, detail can be lost because the pixel actually takes up a narrow but long trapezoid: in the narrow direction, the pixel is getting information from more <b>texels</b> than it actually covers (so details are smeared), and in the long direction the pixel is getting information from fewer <b>texels</b> than it actually covers (so details fall between pixels). To alleviate this, anisotropic ("direction dependent") filtering can be used.|$|R
50|$|When {{texturing}} a 3D {{surface or}} surfaces (a {{process known as}} texture mapping), the renderer maps <b>texels</b> to appropriate pixels in the output picture. On modern computers, this operation is accomplished on the graphics processing unit.|$|R
50|$|Random Access: Since {{predicting}} the order that a renderer accesses <b>texels</b> would be difficult, any texture compression scheme must allow fast random access to decompressed texture data. This tends {{to rule out}} many better-known image compression schemes such as JPEG or Run-length encoding.|$|R
