5|$|Naylor had scouted Australia {{to get an}} idea of {{locations}} and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a Red Dwarf Dimension Jump convention that the film had been rejected by the BBC and the British Film Council. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> it was not ready.|$|E
5|$|Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor, a billionaire's son sent to Smallville to run {{the local}} {{fertilizer}} plant. After Clark saves his life, they become fast friends. As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling {{that he did not}} take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny</b> regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
40|$|Research {{has found}} that more {{aggressive}} cartoons <b>are</b> perceived as <b>funnier.</b> The current study (N = 106; 16 cartoons) examined this finding in more detail by additionally including painfulness and cleverness rankings of cartoons, and by examining possible moderating effects of different humor styles, self-esteem (explicit, implicit), and social desirability. Aggressive or painful cartoons <b>were</b> not perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funnier,</b> but <b>were</b> rated as having a cleverer punch line. Effects were only weakly correlated with participants’ humor styles, but were independent of self-esteem and social desirability. This suggests that aggressive cartoons are not in general perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funnier</b> than non-aggressive ones, and {{that there may be}} other moderators influencing this effect (e. g., the type of cartoons, definition of aggression and funniness, cultural aspects) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{film critic}} writing for The Times, gave the film a mixed review after the UK premiere in September 1957, {{stating that the}} film, [...] "carries over enough gusto from the {{original}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funnier</b> than the usual run of British comedies, without managing to avoid lapses into incoherence through pressing the Joke too far." ...|$|R
5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
25|$|While {{the show}} does derive {{some of its}} humour from {{exploring}} the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is {{the simple fact of}} being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> not to be a political platform. She has also stated that she views comedy {{as one of the most}} valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{finishing}} his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie's career {{was quiet for}} a while as he spent some time with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, but did not make the cut. Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, and again auditioned for Whose Line, this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go. The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.|$|E
5000|$|Bosley Crowther gave a {{negative}} review in The New York Times: [...] "When we take Mr. Brent as a Don Juan, the picture has got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funnier</b> than the main premise, for Mr. Brent, as is generally known, is somewhat {{remote from the}} type.

5000|$|Chris Campling of The Times criticised {{the first}} episode as being a {{duplicate}} of the [...] "dismal, desperate" [...] The Christian O'Connell Solution it replaced, with a turgid format.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his real-life personality, which was described as [...] "a regular guy and, by all accounts, one of show business' most low-key, decent people", Hartman often played seedy, vain or unpleasant characters as well as comedic villains. He noted that his standard character was a [...] "jerky guy", and described his usual roles as [...] "the weasel parade", citing Lionel Hutz, Bill McNeal, Troy McClure and Ted Maltin from Jingle All the Way as examples. Hartman enjoyed playing such roles because he [...] "just want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> and villains tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny</b> because their foibles are all there to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Remer of DVD Talk, on {{the other}} hand, felt that the episode was a [...] "misfire", and he {{argued that it was}} the weakest episode {{included}} on the Princess Day DVD.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the film's withdrawal, Richard Curtis {{admitted}} that the attempt {{to draw attention to the}} cause of lowering [...] emissions may have backfired.

500|$|... "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were {{filmed in}} two days {{alongside}} the sixth series DVD Night and the Doctor extras [...] "Bad Night" [...] and [...] "Good Night". The episodes are intended to show what life aboard the TARDIS would be like. Several editing techniques and doubles {{were used for the}} various shots where there were more than one of the same character on the screen. The mini-episodes received mixed reviews; some scenes were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> but other jokes were criticised for relying on sexist humour.

500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags {{of money in}} each hand and a grin on his face. [...] Another shows only Hanna's hand and wrist—and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. [...] One that is intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny</b> depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna's skirts, wanting {{to go into a}} shop where the labor vote is for sale.

[...] "Ed Wood himself could have told us what's wrong with this movie: the makers felt superior to the material. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> even schlock has to believe in itself.

Wallace, however, promptly took the seat; and what began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funnier</b> than strange, {{he did not get}} up. Not unlikely this circumstance <b>was</b> owing <b>to</b> the fact that several of the rude chairs had soft layers of old blanket tacked on them. Whatever were Frank's internal emotions, he presented a remarkably placid and commonplace exterior; but when Jim began to search for the missing pan of dough, the joker slowly sagged in his chair.|$|R
500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{enjoyed the}} episode, and {{referred}} to its opening by claiming that [...] "any episode that starts with the brilliance that is Truckasaurus has to be good." [...] He liked the decent morals explored in the episode, and called the conclusion a [...] "great one", making it a [...] "consistently fine episode". Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk considered [...] "Bart the Daredevil" [...] {{one of his favorite}} episodes of the season. He found the daredevil scenes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny,</b> but also appreciated the episode's scenes with [...] "true heart". Kleinman concluded by noting that the episode helps The Simpsons stand apart from other animated and live action sitcoms by focusing more on the relationships between the characters than [...] "just a humorous weekly plotline".|$|E

[...] According to the Bums Corner's review the film was a [...] "treat for all ages, and that it was a colorful, musical, humorous romp." [...] Keith Allen of Movie Rapture gave the film 2.5 stars out of 3, explaining that the film's humor was surprisingly clever, and that the film would frequently make you laugh.

500|$|The writing {{staff was}} {{looking for a way to}} end the episode and {{executive}} producer Sam Simon suggested that they watch the film The Quiet Man. The writers came in on a Saturday to watch the film together. They were inspired by the film's fight scene between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen's characters to do a fight scene between Homer and Tom in the episode. The scene was difficult for the producers to sound-mix because they wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>funny</b> but not horrifying. They discovered that the more realistic the effects used sounded, the funnier the scene became. The producers tried all sorts of different sounds for when Homer cracks his back on the fire hydrant and chose the tiniest realistic sound, because they believed that it was the most painful and [...] "hilarious".|$|E
