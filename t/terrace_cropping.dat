The geomorphic regime of the creek changed from aggradation to erosion, as recorded by fanhead trenching and incision of fluvial terrace scarps, and it still persists.

This study was designed to investigate the impact of different seasonal variations and cropping systems on soil microbial biomass and enzymatic activities in sloppy arid soils. Soil samples were collected from the sloppy soils (high, medium and low height terraces) of Khairimurat areas under wheat (Triticum aestivum) –millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) –mung bean (Vigna radiate) cropping systems. The results revealed that the soil microbial biomass Carbon (Cmic), Nitrogen (Nmic), Phosphorous (Pmic), soil enzymes such as Dehydrogenase (DH) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) activity entirely depends on the soil water availability under both cropping systems at all height terraces. The wheat-mung bean cropping systems stored relatively more Nmic, Pmic, AP (activity) and less Cmic, DH (activity) as compared to wheat-millet cropping systems. Regarding the slope gradient under both cropping patterns, high height terraces had retained more Cmic contents, medium height terraces had shown more DH activity and low height terraces had maintained more Pmic contents. In addition to this, Nmic contents and AP activity remained almost similar in all types of <b>terraces</b> under both <b>cropping</b> patterns. Pertaining to seasonal variations under both cropping patterns, the summer season had shown more Cmic, Nmic, Pmic, DH and AP activity as compared to spring, winter and autumn season in all types of terraces. The soil water contents increased down to depth in all types of <b>terraces</b> under both <b>cropping</b> patterns. However, soil water contents remained heterogeneous in all types of <b>terraces</b> under both <b>cropping</b> patterns.

There has been an increase on the soil’s criticality in District of Manding, indicated by the dwindling thickness of solum and the volume of rock on the soil surface which was plentiful during the period of 2011 – 2012. This increasing criticality is assumed {{to be the result of}} soil management that is not in accordance with the principles of land conservation. The study is dedicated to determine the soil damages based on the topography in 2013, and to evaluate the soil criticality beginning in 2011 to 2013, as well as to recommend solutions to improve the soil productivity in the District of Manding. The soil sample collection is performed on the soil layers of 0 – 20 cm, 20 – 40 cm, and 40 – 60 cm using random sampling method. The soil sampling points is determined in accordance with the sampling previously done in 2011 and 2012 based on the use of land. Then, the samples are classified according to their topography. The observation of samples includes density, total porosity, the degree of water release, solum thickness, and the volume of rocks. The study shows that the territory development in the District of Manding during the year of 2011 – 2013 was followed by the improvement of soil condition, indicated by the increases on the quality of density, total porosity and the volume of rocks. Solum thickness and soil permeability increased on its criticality. In other words, if not treated immediately, the soil will potentially become more critical.

Nine soil profiles from three river terraces were selected to cover the different physiographic positions. The land suitability evaluation for annual crops and fruit tress was carried out by matching site conditions with the crop requirement with respect to the characteristics such as: climate condition, topography, drainage, texture, CaCO 3, CEC, % O.

The soils of the study area were classified into: Typic Torrifluvents (unit 1), Entic Haplocambid (unit 2) and Typic Haplocambid (unit 3). The study showed that the soils of the three units were moderately suitable (S 2) due to limitations of inundation, fertility, wetness, erosion, and physical limitations.

Global warming and the unexpected financial crisis will undoubtedly impact all nations. Treating those two critical issues solely by painkiller solutions will fail because only adverse consequences are healed, not their causes. Therefore all sources of issues {{must be treated}} {{at the same time}} by enhancing collaboration between politicians and scientists. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of globalisation of markets for energy, food and other goods have been overlooked, thus deeply weakening the security of society structures in the event of major breakdowns. Therefore dependence among people, organisations and nations must be redesigned and adapted to take into account ecological, social and security impacts. Solving climate, financial and security issues can be done by using tools and principles developed by agronomists because agronomy integrates mechanisms occurring at various space and time levels.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to describe and quantify biologically labile and refractory nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, transformations, and loads in the runoff of two sub-watersheds exhibiting differing agricultural land-use practices. Runoff was impacted by intensive row-cropping for corn production in one of the watersheds while the other one was impacted by dairy livestock management. BACKGROUND: Increasing agricultural development in watersheds has resulted in substantial water, sediment, and nutrient loadings, leading to reduced water quality in receiving waters over the past several decades. Accelerated soil and nutrient import from watersheds is exacerbated by agricultural land-use practices that promote intensive row cropping and rapid drainage of soils for crop production. High runoff of nutrient-rich constituents can also occur via dairy and livestock production, coupled with containment of large numbers of animals in barnyard and pasture settings, resulting in reduction of perennial cover, disturbance of soils, and localized soil nutrient enrichment via animal waste. There is a need to manage watersheds for reduction of soil and nutrient losses by implementing best management practices (BMP’s) (e. g., conservation tillage, perennial vegetation cover and buffering, <b>terracing,</b> contour strip <b>cropping,</b> animal wast...|$|R

40|$|The key {{drivers of}} relief {{transformation}} in the Polish Carpathians (the best studied region of the Carpathians) have been local downpours, continuous rainfalls, and rapid snowmelt. Threshold values are quickly exceeded during such events and powerful morphological processes are initiated. However, due to human activities, geomorphic processes are often accelerated and intensified with serious consequences. Thus, increased human impact is {{a key factor in}} the recent geomorphic evolution of the Polish Carpathians. Over the last two centuries deforestation, intensive agriculture, mining, housing developments on slopes, channelization of streams, and construction of reservoirs all have contributed to changes in the rate of the particular geomorphic processes. The intensity of sheet erosion depends on vegetation cover, land use, and cultivation techniques (<b>terracing,</b> contour tillage, <b>crop</b> rotation, etc.). Slopes bearing poorly constructed infrastructure have become susceptible to mass movements. At higher elevations debris flows, dirty avalanches, and extreme floods are crucial in slope evolution. Over the last 20 years the ratio of agricultural land and the rate of sheet erosion and deflation have decreased, while gully erosion on slopes and the incision of river channels have intensified and the reactivation of shallow landslides has become more common. Increasingly frequent extreme weather events may reverse the stabilizing trend of landform evolution...|$|R

We analysed land-use changes from 1978 to 2007 in a representative watershed of Almuñécar (SE Spain). In 1978 the watershed consisted of 64. 2 % almond, 24. 7 % fallow land, 6. 7 % vineyard, 1. 9 % olive and 2. 5 % other uses. In 2007 much of the traditional orchards had disappeared, leaving only 17 % almond and 0. 6 % vineyard. Not less than 29. 8 % had become shrubland and another 24. 6 % abandoned cropland. However, much {{of the land is}} now under subtropical crops: 19. 2 % avocado (Persea americana M.), 3. 9 % mango (Mangifera indica L.), 2. 4 % loquat (Eriobotrya japonica L.) and 1. 1 % cherimoya (Annona cherimola M.). This intensively irrigated agriculture with subtropical trees on terraces could exacerbate watershed degradation and could become a core problem with implications for sustainable resource use. The abandonment of traditional <b>terraces</b> with rainfed <b>crops</b> has led to the re-emergence of spontaneous native vegetation, promoting a denser plant cover and subsequent decrease in erosion.

An extensive literature search that started in 2006 ha s shown that soil conservation has a long tradition and earlier and present initiatives have resulted in va rious so-called on-farm and off-farm technologies. Indigenous techniques focused on soil and water con servation by ridging, mulching, constructing earth bunds and <b>terraces,</b> multiple <b>cropping,</b> fallowing, a nd the planting of trees. In colonial times, large- scale projects on soil loss control were started by the B ritish Government but many failed, as the imported technologies had little relevance in the tropics. A fter independence, more emphasis was put on soil fertility issues. Decreasing funds at the end of th e oil boom in the 1980 s also restricted soil conser vation schemes. The review also revealed that most of the projects on soil conservation were carried out on research farms and only a few on-farm with the part icipation of farmers. As these have rarely been evaluated to establish ad option rates, an assessment study was performed in 2007 to analyze the effectiveness and adoption of p ast and present soil conservation initiatives, incl uding the sociological, technological, and economic aspec ts. Villages with different types of conservation technologies were visited and farmers in southwest Nigeria were interviewed to obtain information on t heir experiences. Mulching, cover cropping, and contour tillage are likely to be effective on-farm soil conservation measures practiced in Nigeria.

This was in accordance with a legend stating wherever an eagle was seen devouring a snake on a cactus, a great city must be built. Its religion was based on several gods some of which would affect nature, and some of which required sacrifice.

The effect that rock wall terraces have on soil and water conservation and crop production was studied on a steepland farm in southern Honduras during the 1995 growing season. The research compared a site with 10 year old rock terraces with an adjacent portion of the field that had no terraces. Soil was collected at I m intervals between rock walls and at random locations within the unterraced field. At every sample location soil samples were taken in 15 cm depth increments from 0 to 75 cm. These samples were analyzed to compare soil physical and chemical properties between sites. Runoff plots were installed on the terraced (35 % slope) and unterraced (50 % slope) sites to determine differences in sediment yield and runoff. The upslope portion of the 1 m tall rock walls had completely filled in with sediment over the previous decade, thus they were no longer useful for retaining newly eroded material. Indeed, erosion from the terraces was not significantly different from unterraced land. However, total runoff from unterraced sites exceeded total runoff from the terraced field by about 87 mm. Standing crop of maize and sorghum were also measured along transacts between terraced and on unteffaced land. The terraced sites had significantly greater standing crop. Standing crop yield on terraced sites was 59 % greater compared with the unterraced field. Sorghum grain yield was 70 % greater in terraced field. Within each <b>terrace,</b> the <b>crop</b> yields were highest in areas immediately above the rock wall where the most soil deposition had taken place. The results of the chemical soil analysis indicated that soil organic matter was significantly greater on the terraced sites (P < 0. 1). Nitrogen content was significantly greater on the terraced sites. The low nitrogen content in unterraced fields may explain in part the lower biomass and grain yield. The levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, sulfur and pH were generally not statistically different between terraced and unterraced fields. The results of the soil physical analysis indicated that terraced fields tended to have lower bulk density. There was no consistent difference in soil texture between terraced and unterraced sites.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} economic and natural science aspects of soil management and agricultural production in a developing country context. It does so by theoretical as well as empirical investigation, {{based on data from}} field surveys in Kenya’s central highlands over several years. The rationale for the thesis is the need to increase our understanding of the economics of soil capital, land use and agricultural production in order to design policies promoting sustainable development. The thesis includes papers on: optimal soil use with downstream externalities (Ch. 2); determinants of soil capital and agricultural production (Ch. 3; 4); links between farmers’ resource levels, soil properties and agricultural productivity (Ch. 5); and land use-change and determinants of rural-urban migration in Kenya (Ch. 6). Chapter 2 shows that farmers may need incentives (taxes, subsidies or charges) to induce them to reduce soil erosion and thereby downstream damages. Furthermore we find other factors (low discount rate, tenure security, access to credits, crop insurance) that promote accumulation of soil capital and reduce soil loss and nutrient leakage. Regression analyses in Chapter 3 show that farmers’ soil capital is not a given or fixed factor but depends on soil conservation investments, and the allocation of labour, crops, manure and fertilizer in agricultural production. The wide distribution of soil properties across farms indicates the need to tailor technical extension advice to farmers’ preferences and the farm-specific economic and agro-ecological circumstances, and enhance the use of integrated soil analysis, field assessment and detailed soil mapping at farm level. Regressions in Chapter 4 show that agricultural output is determined not only by farmers’ input of land, labour, manure and fertilizer, but also by the quality of soil conservation investments and farm-specific soil properties. Hence, integrating economics and soil science is highly worthwhile in this research area. Omitting soil capital measures can cause omitted variables bias since farmers’ choice of inputs depend both on the quality and status of the soil capital and on other economic conditions (e. g. availability and cost of labour, fertilizers and other inputs). Chapter 5 shows that: relatively richer farmers have higher crop yields; poorer farmers have lower soil nutrient levels; farms with gentle slope and high resource level have the highest land management rating. These results indicate that actions aimed at promoting higher yields and sustainable agriculture will have to differ depending on farmers’ endowment, and that agricultural policy advice needs to be adapted to farmers’ resource levels. Chapter 6 shows that farmers have changed their farming system considerably during the last 40 years: introduced new (cash) crops, increased tree cover, reduced <b>terracing,</b> diversified <b>crops</b> and income sources, and increased market orientation and temporary work in cities. The study emphasizes the need to improve extension advice, rural roads, supply of inputs, local ownership of public soil conservation investment programs, access to credits and output markets, and job opportunities for farmers during agricultural off-season e. g. work in local food processing industries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the PESERA-DESMICE integrated model {{developed in the}} EU FP 6 DESIRE project. PESERA-DESMICE combines a process-based erosion prediction model extended with process descriptions to evaluate the effects of measures to mitigate land degradation, and a spatially-explicit economic evaluation model to evaluate the financial viability of these measures. The model operates on a grid-basis and is capable of addressing degradation problems due to wind and water erosion, grazing and fire. It can evaluate the effects of improved management strategies such as maintaining soil cover, retention of crop residues, irrigation, water harvesting, <b>terracing</b> and strip <b>cropping.</b> These management strategies introduce controls to various parameters slowing down degradation processes. The paper first describes how the physical impact of the various management strategies is assessed. It then continues to evaluate the applicability limitations of the various mitigation options, and to inventory the spatial variation in the investment and maintenance costs involved for each {{of a series of}} technologies that are deemed relevant in a given study area. The physical effects of the implementation of the management strategies relative to the situation without mitigation are subsequently valuated in monetary terms. The model pays particular attention to the spatial variation in the costs and benefits involved as a function of environmental conditions and distance to markets. All costs and benefits are added to a cash flow and a discount rate is applied. This allows a cost-benefit analysis to be performed over a comparative planning period based on the economic lifetime of the technologies being evaluated. It is assumed that land users will only potentially implement technologies if they are financially viable. After this framework has been set-up, various analyses can be made, including the effect of policy options on the potential uptake of mitigation measures and an analysis of where cost-effectiveness is highest. Apart from model description, we present case studies of the use of the framework to illustrate its functioning and relevance for policy-making...|$|R
40|$|Settlement {{processes}} and spatial appropriation in the Central Hunza Valley. Cultural-geographical remarks for the "Hunza-Karakorum 1 : 100 000 " map Although {{some of the}} scientific results of the 1950 s expeditions to the Northwest-Karakoram have been utilized for different research purposes only now the topographic map of the area under study has been published. As a commentary from a cultural-geographical perspective some remarks are presented which emphasize on {{the historical development of}} present-day villages. The evolution of original settlements and subsequent off-branchings are presented. With knowledge about lineage group composition and origin of water works as well as with evidence from colonial reports and travelogues the settlement history of the former semiautonomous principalities of Hunza and Nager is reconstructed. Investigations into the population structure are based on linguistic and denominational criteria and help to understand the separate developments taking part in Hunza and Nager. Three settlement regions could be distinguished in altitudinal sequence along the Hunza River. Basically they correlate with the habitats of three dominant linguistic groups. Settlement history underlines that the Hunza River has acted as a border between Hunza and Nager and has furnished a prominent regional boundary without permitting much transgression of intra-montane migrants. Nevertheless settlement processes feature many similarities in both valley societies. Prior to colonial penetration villages were founded as fortified habitations, a phenomenon which has vanished afterwards. After 1891 new settlements are located within the village lands as small and comparatively open hamlets thus reducing the distance between homestead and agricultural fields. Internal meliorisation continues {{as a result of the}} further establishment of irrigated oases, but at the same time out-migration down the valley commences. Since the first half of the 20 th century enclaves of Hunza and Nager migrants are situated in the vicinity of and within Gilgit Town, the administrative centre of the Northern Areas of Pakistan. After independence only a few new villages have been founded, but existing villages have expanded their cultivated areas and their irrigation networks. The agricultural resource potential of villages as it is composed of <b>terraces</b> for grain <b>crops,</b> orchards with fruit trees and irrigated meadows augmented by livestock-keeping and the seasonal utilization of high pastures has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. The case of Karimabad in the 1990 s is discussed in greater detail and shows how external incomes derived from migrant labour and tourism affect the local economy and especially the significance of mountain agriculture...|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the Mamund Valley. The {{difference}} between villages in the plains {{and those in the}} hills was forcibly demonstrated. On the 29th over a dozen villages in the plains were destroyed without the loss of a single life. On the 30th the tale ran somewhat differently. The village of Agrah adjoins the village of Zagai, the capture of which has already been recorded. It stood in a broad re-entrant of the mountains, and amid ground so tangled and broken, that to move over it is difficult, and to describe it impossible. On the steep face of the mountain great rocks, sometimes thirty feet high, lay tossed about: interspersed with these were huts or narrow <b>terraces,</b> covered with <b>crops,</b> and rising one above the other by great steps of ten or twelve feet each. The attack on such a place was further {{complicated by the fact that}} the same re-entrant contained another village called Gat, which had to be occupied at the same time. This compelled the brigade to attack on a broader front than their numbers allowed. It was evident, as the Guides Cavalry approached the hills, that resistance was contemplated. Several red standards were visible to the naked eye, and the field-glasses disclosed numerous figures lining the ridges and spurs. The squadrons, advancing as far as the scrub would allow them, soon drew the fire of isolated skirmishers. Several troops dismounted, and returned the salute with their carbines, and at 8.45 a dropping fire began. The brigade now came into action in the following formation. The cavalry, on the extreme left, covered the head of a considerable valley, from which the flank was threatened; the Guides Infantry and the Royal West Kent Regiment prolonged the line to the centre of the attack; the 31st Punjaub Infantry moved against the spurs to the right of the village, and the 38th Dogras were in reserve. The action was begun by the Guides Infantry storming the ridges to the left of the enemy's position. These were strongly held and fortified by sungars, behind which the defenders were sheltered. The Guides advanced at a brisk pace, and without much firing, across the open ground to the foot of the hills. The tribesmen, shooting from excellent cover, maintained a hot fire. The bullets kicked up the dust in all directions, or whistled viciously through the air; but the distance was short, and it was soon apparent that the enemy did not mean to abide the assault. When the troops got within 100 yards and fixed bayonets, a dozen determined men were still firing from the sungars. The Afridi and Pathan companies of the Guides, uttering shrill cries of exultation, culminating in an extraordinary yell, dashed forward, climbed the hill as only hillmen can climb, and cleared the crest. On the side of the next hill the figures of the retreating tribesmen were visible, and many were shot down before they could find shelter.|$|R
40|$|A sound {{understanding}} of the transport and fate of leached nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 [...] N) in shallow groundwater is key to understanding the impacts of land use intensification {{on the quality of}} groundwater and surface water bodies. However, these are not well understood in the Lower Rangitikei catchment. This study was undertaken to assess the groundwater flow pattern and its interactions with the Rangitikei River; the redox conditions of the groundwater; and the extent of NO 3 [...] N attenuation in shallow groundwater in the Lower Rangitikei catchment. Groundwater depths were collected from more than 100 wells to map the piezometric surface to inform the groundwater flow pattern within the study area. Groundwater interactions with the Rangitikei River were estimated qualitatively from two longitudinal river flow and water quality surveys (on 6 th and 20 th January 2015) under low-flow conditions. Fifteen wells were sampled and analysed in the study area during December 2014 to characterise the groundwater redox condition. A total of nine piezometers were installed at a range of depths (3 m and 6 m) on two dairy farms (sand country and river <b>terrace)</b> and one <b>cropping</b> farm (sand country). In these piezometers, NO 3 [...] N, dissolved oxygen (DO) and other parameters were monitored over March, April and May 2015. Single-well push-pull tests were used to measure NO 3 [...] N attenuation in shallow groundwater during May 2015. Groundwater flow was largely influenced by the regional topography, particularly shallow groundwater (< 30 m), where it flows from elevated areas such as Marton in a southerly direction towards the Rangitikei River. The longitudinal river flow and water quality surveys revealed a dynamic relationship between the river and the underlying aquifer. The surveys suggested groundwater discharges into the river both upstream and downstream of Bulls. The groundwater redox characterisation showed generally anoxic/reduced groundwater across the lower Rangitikei catchment area. Groundwater typically has a low DO concentration (< 1 mg/L) with elevated levels of available electron donors, particularly dissolved organic carbon and Fe 2 +. These groundwater characteristics provide for generally favourable conditions for NO 3 [...] N reduction. Monitoring at the installed piezometers showed a generally low NO 3 [...] N concentration at these sites. The push-pull tests revealed NO 3 [...] N reduction occurring at all three sites, with the rate of reduction varying between 0. 04 mg N L- 1 hr- 1 to 1. 57 mg N L- 1 hr- 1. These results suggest that groundwater is likely to be connected with the Lower Rangitikei River. However, NO 3 [...] N concentrations in the river and groundwater were generally low, especially for the river at low flows. This suggests NO 3 [...] N may be undergoing reduction within shallow groundwater before it has a chance to seep into the river. Further evidence for appreciable levels of NO 3 [...] N reduction in the shallow groundwater is provided by the redox characterisation of reduced groundwater and the push-pull tests. However, more spatial and temporal surveys and in-situ measurements of denitrification occurrence in the shallow groundwater of the study area are required...|$|R
40|$|Soil is {{vulnerable}} to degradation through deforestation, desertification, salinization, overgrazing and soil erosion. Water erosion causing factors are slope, rainfall, soil type, plant cover, runoff and lack of soil conservation techniques. Present study {{was carried out in}} the Dharabi watershed (196 km 2) in Chakwal district of Pakistan, where high intensity rainstorms (especially during summer) cause most of the erosion. First part compared the sediment yield from gully and terraced gully land use systems in two pairs of small catchments,-one at Rahna Sadaat and the other at Thoa Bahadar. In each pair, gully system was adjacent to the terraced gully system. Instruments (recording rainguage and water level recorder) were installed to monitor the runoff and sediment yield from all the catchments. Data of soil, land use and vegetation cover were recorded. During three years (2009, 2010, 2011), the sites received 547, 725 and 686 mm rainfall, respectively with corresponding Gumbel probability of exceedance as 0. 67, 0. 30 and 0. 44. In 2010 and 2011, the terraced gully system produced almost 70 per cent lower average sediment yield as compared to gully system. Number of runoff events and runoff coefficient were lower in terrace system. The terraced system produced 64 per cent and 74 per cent lower sediment bound organic carbon losses at two sites with the largest amount of 88. 4 kg ha? 1 from gully catchment. At Rahna Sadaat, average annual loss of sediment bound nitrogen from Terrace-I was 2. 5 times lower than from adjacent Gully-I. Loss of available phosphorus was also lower (< 1 kg ha? 1) due to lower content in the soils. Similar results were observed for loss of sediment bound available potassium at this site. Here, terraced catchment decreased annual average loss of extractable K by 3. 5 times (0. 29 kg ha? 1 as compared to 1. 01 kg ha? 1 from the gully catchment) during 2010 - 2011. In the second part, soil erosion plots were established. Soil loss from a cultivated slope on a terrace and an undisturbed slope with natural cover was evaluated to ascertain the impact of cultivation of slopes already converted into terraces. A relatively steep slope (11. 2 per cent) and a gentle slope (6. 1 per cent) with natural vegetation were compared with a gentle slope (5. 8 per cent) on cultivated <b>terrace</b> with existing <b>cropping</b> pattern. Cultivated slope produced the highest (8. 96 Mg ha? 1) soil loss annually as compared to the other undisturbed gentle and steep slopes, viz., 2. 08 and 4. 66 Mg ha? 1, respectively. This suggests that a cultivated field on terrace generate more soil loss compared to an undisturbed slope with natural vegetation having similar or higher slope gradient of 11 per cent. It is concluded from the results that the use of a terraced gully system is helpful in reducing losses of sediments and adsorbed nutrients to the reservoir. On the other hand, cultivation on converted sloping terraces increases the soil loss at plot scale. Findings of this study could help making policy decisions regarding the land use change and its downstream impacts...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{agroforestry}} in {{a mountain}} setting means battling with soil erosion and breathing new life into Haiti s agriculture. At present, sloping land is being damaged by inappropriate farming techniques practised by farmers who take the line of least resistance to ensure day-to-day survival. Between independence in 1804 and the 1980 s, Haiti witnessed a struggle between large and small-sized properties. The evidence speaks for itself: only the small-scale properties have remained in place to feed the population it is these that have shaped Haiti s agriculture. But in the early 1980 s, these concerns began to lose momentum, a process which became even more marked in 1985, {{with the onset of}} the troubles that led to the departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier. Today, in some departments, the average farm is just 0. 32 ha. Between 1985 and 1989, agriculture s contribution to Haiti s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an annual 5 % and, from 1990 to present day, that trend has continued. Agriculture currently accounts for 27 % of the GDP and 7. 4 % of exports. Yields of the main crops are lower than those of {{any other country in the}} region and Haiti imports nearly all the products it consumes. One reason for this constant fall in output is erosion, which causes a loss in soil fertility. And in Haiti, the problem of erosion is tied up with poverty, insecure land access and inadequate farming methods. Tonnes of lost soil Farming as practised in Haiti eats away at the country s soil capital. When a farmer notices a decline in fertility on the plot of land he is farming, he looks for other land, whether it is arable or not. This constant search damages our country s natural resources. Wooded land and forest cover is diminishing due to the advance of agriculture and the search for fuel wood. Techniques do exist for effectively combating erosion, but they are not practised. As with agriculture, the fight against erosion suffers from a lack of investment, and for almost 2 years now, Haiti has been living under a transition government which cannot make a long-term plan. If the fight against erosion is closely connected with the challenge of developing mountain agriculture in Haiti, that is because 63 % of the land is mountainous. Half the population lives in mountainous terrain. So an integrated system of mountain agriculture is essential if environmental protection and economic development are to co-exist. How much soil is lost in Haiti? Nobody knows. During the American occupation, between 1915 and 1934, demonstration plots were set up to quantify the country s particularly acute erosion phenomenon. FAO did the same in the 1970 s. Soil scientists worked out that Nature takes 30 years to produce a layer of arable soil 25 mm thick, or 11 t/ha, and that figure represents the minimum thickness if the land is to be profitable. Now in Haiti, soil losses sometimes exceed 120 t/ha! Farming is practised on any kind of land and any kind of slope. Slopes with a gradient of 60 % are ploughed. We need to establish a typology: all land with slopes of between 0 and 20 % would be cultivated, with no soil conservation intervention. Land with slopes of between 20 and 50 % would also be farmed, but using drastic soil conservation techniques: contour channels, <b>terraces,</b> alley <b>cropping,</b> living hedges, etc. All land with slopes of more than 50 % would be used for growing fruit trees and agroforestry. On flatter land and plains, agroforestry systems established around land plots would allow farmers to diversify their source of revenue. Previously, coffee was widely grown in Haiti. It is still grown, but due to the fall in world prices, farmers have largely replaced it with more profitable crops such as beans and yams. But growing these crops causes more erosion. Fruit farming has suffered due to political instability and lack of road transport the fruit did not reach its destination quickly enough, even for the domestic market. An alternative for farmers Let s be practical, unless there is more research, information and assistance, farmers are never going to change their practices. There is no point in trying, unless we have alternatives to suggest to them. So there needs to be funding, and better access to land and credit. The farmers need some kind of subsidy. That is crucial if fruit farming and agroforestry are to be developed. Increasing access to land for farmers is just a half-measure if you don t also give them a suitable technology package to go with it. We need to help them buy inputs and farm tools, to diversify their revenues by supporting on- and off-farm activities such as fruit processing, honey production, small-scale livestock rearing and ecotourism. We need to help them develop and improve post-harvest storage techniques, so they can access outside markets, as well as domestic ones. All this needs to be achieved within a well established macro-economic framework, without infringing the rules of the World Trade Organization. But we also need to work out a programme for subsidising agriculture. And there is the rub, for at present we are living in an economic climate that is far too liberal.
