It was at this point that a disgusted Murphy made his pronouncement, despite being offered the time and chance to calibrate and test the sensor installation prior to the <b>test</b> <b>proper,</b> which he declined somewhat irritably, getting off on the wrong foot with the MX981 team. In an interview conducted by Nick Spark, George Nichols, another engineer who was present, stated that Murphy blamed the failure on his assistant after the failed test, saying, [...] "If that guy has any way of making a mistake, he will." [...] Nichols' account is that [...] "Murphy's law" [...] came about through conversation among {{the other members of the}} team; it was condensed to [...] "If it can happen, it will happen," [...] and named for Murphy in mockery of what Nichols perceived as arrogance on Murphy's part. Others, including Edward Murphy's surviving son Robert Murphy, deny Nichols' account (which is supported by Hill, both interviewed by Spark), and claim that the phrase did originate with Edward Murphy.

40|$|A {{subset of}} data was used from the Waterloo Longitudinal Reactivity Study (WLRS) to examine {{predictors}} of cardiovascular reactivity during the Type A Structured Interview (SI). Sex, age, total cholesterol, {{body mass index}} (BMI), activity level, smoking, drinking, family history of cardiovascular disease, anger-management styles (i. e., hostility, SI Components, and anger) and respective resting levels for the dependent measures were the predictor variables. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were the dependent measures. For this study, 111 males and 129 females completed the study. They were first or second year students from the University of Waterloo. The subjects' mean age was 20. 44 years. In the WLRS, {{subjects were asked to}} come to the laboratory on several occasions. The first occasion was to obtain consent. The second occasion was to habituate subjects to the laboratory setting and the equipment. The third session was the <b>test</b> <b>proper.</b> The focus of this secondary data analysis was to examine the predictive property of anger-management styles to reactivity during one task in the <b>test</b> <b>proper,</b> the SI.

These variables, along with the remaining independent variables were entered in multiple regression equations. For norepinephrine, epinephrine, and DBP reactivity only the respective resting values were predictive of reactivity. The independent measures, sex and BMI were predictive of SBP reactivity. Predictors of HR reactivity were resting HR, anger(one of the three factors), and sex. The results of this study did not support the contention that personality measures are predictive of catecholamine or blood pressure reactivity.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the renal concentrating mechanism is maintained by the anatomical and functional arrangements of the renal transport mechanisms for solute (sodium, potassium, urea, etc) and water and by {{the function of the}} regulatory hormone for renal concentration, vasopressin. The discovery of aquaporins (water channels) in the cell membranes of the renal tubular epithelial cells has elucidated the mechanisms of renal actions of vasopressin. Loss of the concentrating mechanism results in uncontrolled polyuria with low urine osmolality and, if the patient is unable to consume (appropriately) large volumes of water, hypernatremia with dire neurological consequences. Loss of concentrating mechanism can be the consequence of defective secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland (congenital or acquired central diabetes insipidus) or poor response of the target organ to vasopressin (congenital or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). The differentiation between the three major states producing polyuria with low urine osmolality (central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia) is done by a standardized water deprivation <b>test.</b> <b>Proper</b> diagnosis is essential for the management, which differs between these three conditions...|$|E

Data from standardised internal quality control (IQC) samples were plotted on charts and used as the assay performance indicators with reference to expected upper and lower control limits. Based on unprocessed (optical density) and normalised absorbance values (calculated as a percentage positivity of a control), dispersion of values from the expected data range was estimated plotting the location and deviation of the values. In addition, assay precision was estimated plotting the distribution of coefficients of variation< 10 % of the IQCs.
