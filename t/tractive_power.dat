The normal way to drain agricultural land was to use a mole plough to dig a subterranean drainage channel. The mole plough has a vertical blade with a cylindrical “mole” attached to the bottom.

40|$|The {{choice of}} tractor {{configuration}} is of primary importance in tillage {{operations for the}} optimisation of traction performance, i. e. for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. Tyre inflation pressure and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant role}} in controlling the traction performance of a tractor. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of tyre inflation pressure and wheel load on the traction performance of a mechanical front wheel drive MFWD tractor (65 kW engine power) on an agricultural clay (C) Vertic Cambisol on the basis of results of traction tests and simulations with a semi-empirical soil-tyre interaction model adapted for MFWD vehicles. The traction tests were carried out using four tractor configurations with two tractor weights (40. 8 kN and 50. 2 kN) and two tyre inflation pressures (60 kPa and 160 kPa). Traction performance was considered in terms of drawbar pull, traction coefficient, <b>tractive</b> efficiency, <b>power</b> delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption in relation to wheel slip. A decrease in tyre pressure and an increase in wheel load resulted in higher drawbar pull however, only the former produced improvements in terms of coefficient of traction, <b>tractive</b> efficiency, <b>power</b> delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption, while the only significant benefit resulting from the latter was a reduction in specific fuel consumption at a tyre pressure of 160 kPa and a slip of under 15 %. </p...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} {{computer-based}} simulation allow prediction of output variables, {{often as a}} function of time, for a given model of a physical system for a given set of initial conditions and input variables. In the case of train performance simulation models, the possible output variables include train speed or distance travelled, both expressed as functions of time. The corresponding input variables, also expressed as functions of time, are the <b>tractive</b> force or <b>power</b> levels for given train characteristics and route information such as gradients, track curvature and speed restrictions. Inverse simulation methods, on the other hand, allow selected model variables (such as the tractive force at any time instant) to be found from other specified model variables applied as input (such as the train speed or distance travelled versus time) for a given set of route conditions and train characteristics. The specific inverse simulation method presented in the paper is based on feedback principles. Illustrative results are used to verify this inverse simulation approach for train performance applications, and further cases are used to show that the inverse formulation provides an insight that is different from that obtained using more conventional forward simulation techniques...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} a century of British rule, India gained her {{independence}} on August 15, 1947. The Republic of India was formally inaugurated on January 26, 1950. India has an area of 1, 281, 410 square miles and a population 1 of 361 million - the average density of population being 282 per square mile as compared to 750 in England, 426 in Japan and 50 in the United States. The country is riCh in natural resources, but the population is largely poor. According to the latest official figures 1 the total area under cultivation is about 307 million acres and an additional area of about 93 million acres is lying uncultivated due to Kans infestation, bad drainage and lack of power and communications. At present the net area sown annually is about 266 million acres, the rest (41 million acres) is left fallow. About seventy {{percent of the population is}} engaged in agricultural pursuits, still there is a shortage of food for the population. The present production 2 of cereals in India is about 45 million tons, which falls short of the population requirements on a minimum nutritional standard by about 5 million tons. The chief cause of the food shortage in India is that although she gained 82 percent of the population or the undivided subcontinent at the time of partition in 1947, 32 she was given only 65 percent of the wheat growing areas and 68 percent of the rice growing areas. While the population has been increasing, the production of food has not increased proportionately and had been affected by such natural calamities as floods or drought. Also, during the years of foreign rule, India remained in a backward state in agriculture, as well as in other fields. The yield per acre is nearly the lowest in the world. This is the result of unreliability of water supply - only 49 million aeres of cultivated land has controlled irrigation facilities, the rest being dependent on weather, and unscientific and primitive methods of farming. The majority of farmers still use the wooden implements as used by their forefathers. As a result, the production per worker in India. is nearly the lowest in the world. It appears that perhaps power available for agricultural operations has been one of the important limiting factors or agricultural production in India. It has also now been widely recognized that bullock power is not the adequate form of farm power for Indian conditions and as such there has been a great deal of attention towards the introduction of tractors in the last six years. This thesis is written to evaluate the use of tractors as a power unit for India. Before the World War II, large farms owned by landlords, sugar factory estates and government experimental farms were the only farms using tractors. The conditions have since changed and the farmers are showing increased interest in the use of better farm machinery. They are finding then to prepare better seed beds and relieve hard labour, which has resulted in greater yields per acre. In the early postwar period about 250 army machines such as caterpillar bull-dozers and tractors were the first to be adopted by the government for land reclamation work. In 1947, after the partition of the country, an increased interest developed in the use of tractors for agriculture. Also, due to the shortage of food grains, the Indian government faced the vital and immediate problem of making India self-sufficient with regards to food grains. In order to cover the food shortage, the central government of India immediately launched a "Grow more Foodn programme. The reclamation of potentially fertile land lying uncultivated was started by means of large tractors. Also under the influence of publicity, considerable amount of interest was aroused among people in the use of tractors to cultivate as much land as possible. In the last five years the progress in mechanization has been quite rapid, in as much as it has led to the suggestion that tractors can be profitably introduced in Indian Agriculture. The American tractors have made a tremendous contribution in the advancement of America during the last thirty years. These tractors were not used in India to any great extent in the past due to the unavailability of American tractors, service facilities and spare parts. The reason appears to be the lack of attention of American manufacturers where Britain had the monopoly due to political domination. The second world war changed the complete picture due to the increased American manufacturers production. This has eventually compelled them to seek market in India, where tractors are being introduced for agricultural work. Most of the tractors, which are used in North America, are now on sale in India. These tractors have hardly been tested in India with respect to their tractive performance and suitability. This thesis includes a combined report on the <b>tractive</b> performance and <b>power</b> development of tractors, so that they may be successfully appraised as a power unit in India...|$|R
5000|$|Noise : A {{single source}} of <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> (i.e., motors in one place), is quieter than {{multiple}} operational power units, where {{one or more}} motors are located under every carriage. The noise problem is particularly noticeable in diesel multiple units.|$|E
50|$|After delivery, these {{vehicles}} were nearly exclusively used in local traffic within the Großraums Hannover transport association. They were mostly {{used on the}} railway lines of the then-future StadtExpress and today's S-Bahn network; Class 141 locomotives were commonly used as <b>tractive</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
50|$|Depending on subseries, 1xx, 2xx or 3xx, {{some members}} of this class can drive with maximum speed 100 km/h, 120 km/h, 140 km/h, or 160 km/h (latest series), {{depending}} on the gearing. The most common gearings are for 120 km/h (classes 0xx, 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 8xx) intended for freight and passenger trains, and 140 km/h (classes 6xx and 7xx) intended for passenger services, with locos for 160 km/h being rare and locos for 100 km/h all converted for 120 km/h. The models with higher maximum speed got less <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> and are used for passenger or light freight trains only, whereas the models with lower maximum speed got high <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> and are thus able to pull heavy freight trains as well.|$|E

50|$|The designer, Major Frank Dutton, SAR Signal Engineer and the Motor Transport Superintendent, {{argued that}} a rubber tyre in contact with a hard road would be better at {{transferring}} <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> than a steel wheel on steel rail.

5000|$|Meanwhile, in North America {{during the}} 1910s, {{tractors}} were evolving away from traction engine-sized monsters toward smaller, lighter, more affordable machines. The Fordson tractor especially had made tractors affordable and practical for small and medium family farms {{for the first}} time in history. Cultivating was somewhat of an afterthought in the Fordson's design, which reflected the fact that even just bringing practical motorized <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> alone to this market segment was in itself a milestone. This left an opportunity for others to pursue better motorized cultivating. Between 1915 and 1920, various inventors and farm implement companies experimented with a class of machines referred to as motor cultivators, which were simply modified horse-drawn shank-type cultivators with motors added for self-propulsion. This class of machines found limited market success. But by 1921 International Harvester had combined motorized cultivating with the other tasks of tractors (<b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> and belt work) to create the Farmall, the general-purpose tractor tailored to cultivating that basically invented the category of row-crop tractors.|$|E
5000|$|African Rail & Traction Services (ARTS) specialises in the purchase, {{overhaul}} and lease of locomotives, trackmobiles {{and other}} rolling stock.

It has purchased locomotives from as far afield as Australia.|$|E
50|$|The power {{produced}} by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment. This may be accomplished via a drawbar or hitch system if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> of the engine, or via a pulley or power takeoff system if the implement is stationary, {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|E
50|$|The class {{represents}} the final major {{revision of the}} DB V 160 family of locomotives; having the preferred features of the antecedent locomotives, including a hydrodynamic brake, and a single engine providing electrical train heating via a generator as well as <b>tractive</b> <b>power.</b> The class were also the most numerous of the family, providing {{the backbone of the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn's main-line diesel locomotive traction from the 1970s up to the reunification of Germany.|$|E
50|$|Some {{problems}} were experienced using this configuration {{and after a}} couple of major derailments, the locomotive configuration was changed to four sets, with locomotive set D initially made up of two Class 34 diesel-electric locomotives at the rear end of the train, pushing at between 40% and 50% of <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> at all times depending on the grades being traversed. The total maximum number allowed was still between nine and twelve locomotives per train.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to towing an implement or supplying <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> through the wheels, most tractors have {{a means to}} transfer power to another machine such as a baler, swather, or mower. Unless it functions solely by pulling it through or over the ground, a towed implement needs its own power source (such as a baler or combine with a separate engine) or else a means of transmitting power from the tractor to the mechanical operations of the equipment.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} few months of operation, horses were used to provide the <b>tractive</b> <b>power.</b> Where the line descended the horses were carried in a truck for the 22 km descent and then hauled the train for the {{remainder}} of journey. For the journey up, one horse was used to haul 5 or six empty wagons. The trains were pulled at 3 or 4 km/h but ran down hill at a speed of 24 to 28 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} of series 218 {{were the}} last of the V 160 family to be developed; the main new feature was the use of a single engine to provide <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> as well as electrical train heating when required (via an attached generator), the simplification over the two engined DB Class 217 was preferred, and was made possible by the availability of a higher powered (~1840 kW) engine compared to the original DB Class V 160 (~1400 kW).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tractive</b> <b>power</b> was {{provided}} by two motor-carriages, manufactured by the Ashbury Carriage Company (Manchester), one 33 ft and 21 ft, with a motor and passenger compartments, the longer vehicle had first and second class seating, the shorter only second class. The longer locomotive-car had provision for 24 passengers in 2nd class and 10 in first class accommodation. A 33 ft bogie 5.5 ton passenger carriage was also acquired from the Starbuck Company (Birkenhead), with seating for 44.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{war years}} in the early 1940s, the South Australian Railways (SAR) had a desperate need for {{additional}} <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> on increasingly growing troop and supply trains and with the combined need for quick acceleration and high speed running on the flat and general straight mainlines to the north to Port Pirie, as well as power [...] "under the belt" [...] for the long 19 mi, 1-in-45 (2.2%) graded slog up the Adelaide Hills to Melbourne, a new locomotive design was required by the SAR. With this in mind, the 520 class was commissioned, combining the better features of the earlier 500 and 620 class locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the fall}} of Singapore rubber was scarce and so {{at the request of}} the Ministry of Supply a Bedford QL was adapted using a Carden Lloyd {{suspension}} taken from a Bren Gun Carrier. While the Bedford-Bren was capable of impressive feats of <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> (which could have been easily produced in its own right as a prime mover) British authorities, unlike the Americans and Germans, did not favour the half-track. The shortage of rubber was not as severe as anticipated and official interest in the project waned. Not only did this British parallel to the German Maultier not go into production, the single prototype was converted back into an all-wheel vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Dutton {{argued that}} a rubber tyre in contact with a hard road would be better at {{transferring}} <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> than a steel wheel on steel rail. He claimed that the tractive effort to be obtained by using rubber-tyred driving wheels running on roads was 1330 lb per long ton of adhesive weight, compared to the 334 lb per long ton which could be obtained by using steel wheels running on rails. His proposed system would use railway trucks on rails, hauled by a rail-and-road-borne tractor which would be guided by a four-wheeled bogie on the rails, but with driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres which would run on well-prepared strips of road {{on each side of}} the rail track.|$|E
5000|$|Rather than {{carrying}} an {{internal combustion engine}} or batteries, or connecting to overhead powerlines, a gyrobus carries a large flywheel that is spun at up to 3,000 RPM by a [...] "squirrel cage" [...] motor. Power for charging the flywheel was sourced by means of three booms mounted on the vehicle's roof, which contacted charging points located as required or where appropriate (at passenger stops en route, or at terminals, for instance). To obtain <b>tractive</b> <b>power,</b> capacitors would excite the flywheel's charging motor so that it became a generator, in this way transforming the energy stored in the flywheel back into electricity. Vehicle braking was electric, {{and some of the}} energy was recycled back into the flywheel, thereby extending its range.|$|E

Bullocks were preferred by many explorers and teamsters because they were cheaper, quieter, tougher and more easily maintained than horses therefore making them more popular for draught work. Frequently comprising long trains of bullocks, yoked in pairs, they were used for hauling drays, wagon or jinker loads of goods and lumber prior to the construction of railways and the formation of roads. In early days the flexible two-wheeled dray, with a centre pole and narrow 3 in iron tyres was commonly used. The four-wheeled dray or box wagon came into use after about 1860 for loads of 6 to 8 tons and was drawn by 16 to 18 bullocks. A bullock team was led by a pair of well trained leaders who responded to verbal commands as they did not have reins or a bridle. [...] The bullock team driver was called a bullocky, bullock puncher or teamster.|$|E
