5|$|In July 1962, Algeria became {{independent}} of France. As a staunch {{political and financial}} supporter of the Algerian independence movement, Nasser considered the country's independence to be a personal victory.

5|$|By the 11th century, the Muslim {{world had}} {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), {{each with its}} own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, a preference for the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, was supported by <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>royal</b> <b>family</b> (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E

50|$|Although the Al ash-Sheikh's {{domination}} of the religious establishment has diminished in recent decades, they still hold most of the important religious posts in Saudi Arabia, and are {{closely linked to the}} Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage.

5|$|In September 2006, The Guardian {{reported}} on concerns regarding {{funding for the}} Tablighi Jamaat's construction project. Documentation filed with the Charity Commission indicated that 's annual donations {{were in the order}} of only £500,000, suggesting the need for significant extra financial support to fund the building project. It was suggested that the project would be funded by Saudi Salafi groups.

5|$|Nasser's {{considerations}} for sending troops to Yemen may {{have included the}} following: (1) impact of his support to the Algerian War of Independence from 1954–62; (2) Syria breaking up from Nasser's United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1961; (3) {{taking advantage of a}} breach in British and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the FLN in Algeria and primarily for his efforts to undermine the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958; (4) confronting imperialism, which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny; (5) guaranteeing dominance of the Red Sea from the Suez Canal to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait; (6) retribution against <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>royal</b> <b>family,</b> whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.|$|E
5|$|In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, {{joined by}} several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and, despite {{military}} help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Amin {{was forced to}} flee into exile by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. He escaped first to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>royal</b> <b>family</b> allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for his staying out of politics. Amin lived {{for a number of}} years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania war for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin in 1980, and secured the first interview with him since his deposition.|$|E

5|$|On a {{surprise}} visit to Damascus {{to celebrate the}} union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds {{in the hundreds of}} thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the United Arab States—in place of total integration. While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's plane. As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>royal</b> <b>family</b> to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>royal</b> <b>family)</b> constitute a significant feature.|$|E

5000|$|The Homaidan Al-Turki case sparked {{controversy}} and high-profile attention from Muslims worldwide, particularly in <b>the</b> Kingdom of <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, where local media portrayed {{him as a}} victim of bias against Muslims and said he would not have been convicted of these crimes had he been tried in his native country. For example, in a show of support, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> government provided Al-Turki with $400,000 to post bond. In November 2006, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers travelled to Saudi Arabia where he visited King Abdullah, Crown Prince Sultan, and Al-Turki’s family in an attempt to clear up [...] "misperceptions" [...] about the U.S. judicial system and ease <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>royal</b> <b>family's</b> concerns over whether Homaidan Al-Turki was treated fairly.
