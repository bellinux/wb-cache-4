Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>himself</b> asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>himself</b> would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|While {{economic}} policies were the original motivating {{factor in the}} growing partisan split, foreign policy also became a factor. Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI, some of Hamilton's followers began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Washington particularly feared British entrance into the war, as he worried that sympathy for France and hatred for Britain would propel the United States into the French Revolutionary Wars, to the ruin of the American economy. In 1793, after Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars, several Democratic-Republican Societies were formed. These societies, centered {{on the middle class}} of several eastern cities, opposed Hamilton's {{economic policies}} and supported France. Conservatives came to fear these societies as populist movements that sought to re-make the class order. That same year, the British began attacking American ships that were trading with France, fanning the flames of anti-British sentiment. As Washington continued to seek peace with Great Britain, critics finally began to attack <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{establishing}} the ICAB, Duarte Costa {{continued to use}} the same vestments, insignia, and rites as he had in the Catholic Church.

On September 27, 1948, the ICAB churches were closed by the courts, {{on the grounds that they}} were deceiving the public into thinking they were Catholic churches and clergy. Duarte Costa quickly filed an appeal, and in 1949 the Supreme Court ruled that the ICAB could reopen its doors on condition that the church use a modified liturgy and its clergy wear gray cassocks to minimize the potential for confusion with the black-colored Roman Catholic clergy.|$|E
25|$|Cali {{is governed}} by a mayor who is elected for a {{four-year}} term. Under the mayor, there are several administrative departments and secretaries. Mayor's elections started in 1986, followed by Governors' in 1992. Before these dates, all Colombian regional executive-branch leaders were appointed by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>himself.</b> The first elected mayor was Carlos Holmes Trujillo of the Liberal Party. Unlike other Colombian cities, Cali has not properly adapted to the quite new Mayor's election system. The city has had some unsuccessful stories with some of its elected mayors, two of them being removed from office. Some argue this is caused by Aguablanca's huge mass population often driven to vote based in small short-termed gifts from populist candidates fully aware of this District needs. There were recorded cases of candidates giving bricks, cement and other stuff to the District's leaders in exchange for shifting votes to their campaigns.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so he knows how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>himself</b> was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E

500|$|During 2013, McCain was {{a member}} of a bi-partisan group of senators, the [...] "Gang of Eight", which {{announced}} principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform.

However, the option would be imposed later in the year anyway, much to the senator's displeasure.

500|$|The {{benefits}} {{of economic growth}} during the Ravalomanana administration were not evenly distributed, leading to higher costs of living for all Malagasy and a deepening poverty among much of the population with fewer able to increase their wealth.

[...] Ravalomanana's critics remarked that the greatest beneficiary of his reforms and policies was <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>himself,</b> giving the example of road construction projects that enabled Tiko to distribute more efficiently {{as well as the}} farmers and other small businesspeople targeted by the initiative. Furthermore, his own companies tended to be awarded most of the government contracts for which they bid, although this occurred transparently and legally, due to a weak legal framework around conflict of interest. Critics condemned his tendency to make unilateral decisions and disregard the views of his entourage, a number of whom resigned or were dismissed.
