5|$|In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) {{stops the}} funeral of Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) after seeing {{irregularities}} in her death. Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry), and siblings Sara (Jo Armeniox) and Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens), all say that Nikki was suicidal, with evidence at the scene suggesting this, but when Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) do an autopsy, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> otherwise. Meanwhile, Megan finds out from daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser) that her ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) is {{in a relationship with}} her boss Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan).|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that Domitian {{did make}} {{concessions}} toward senatorial opinion. Whereas {{his father and}} brother had concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of}} the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E

5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of fishers preying on cats and small dogs; in Massachusetts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517202212/http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/wildlife/living/living_with_fisher.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2016}} but in general, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> these attacks are rare. A 1979 study examined the stomach contents of all fishers trapped in the state of New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found no cat remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (scat and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges {{surrendered}} to the Romans in March or early April of 175. Their prince, Banadaspus, had attempted peace in early 174; however, the offer was refused, and Banadaspus was deposed by the Iazyges and replaced by Zanticus. The terms of the peace treaty were harsh: the Iazyges were required to provide 8,000 men as auxiliaries and release 100,000 Romans they had taken hostage, and forbidden from living within ten Roman miles (roughly 9miles or 15km) of the Danube. Marcus had intended to give even harsher termsit is said by Cassius Dio {{that he wanted to}} entirely exterminate the Iazyges,but was distracted by the rebellion of Avidius Cassius. Of the 8,000 auxiliaries, 5,500 of them were sent to Britannia, to serve with the Legio VI Victrix, suggesting that the situation there was serious; {{it is likely that the}} British tribes, seeing the Romans being preoccupied with war in Germania and Dacia, had decided to rebel. All of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that the Iazyges' horsemen were an impressive success. The 5,500 sent to Britain were not allowed to return home, even after their 20-year term of service had ended. After Marcus Aurelius had beaten the Iazyges, he took the title of Sarmaticus, in accordance with the Roman practice of victory titles.|$|E

5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that they were, {{by the time of}} construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|While Richard {{was still}} in Sicily, word reached {{the king of the}} {{disputes}} between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome. Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been. Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.|$|E
