5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel <b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>We</b> Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E
500|$|The Escapist, {{thinking}} {{the issues of}} a year past had died down, especially since they hadn't aroused much concern on first coming to light, did not expect the discord that ensued; response on their forums was heated, and the ESRB took [...] "vigorous exception" [...] to the piece. Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. That sounded like a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E

6000|$|The last {{sentence}} raised my dashed spirits again, and I said, confidently: [...] "You must find {{our system of}} baggage-checks delightful."

[...] "By-the-way," [...] I ventured to add, [...] "I suppose you meant to say you brought two checks when I asked you for them at the train just now? But you really said you bought them." ...|$|R

5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> century BC, <b>the</b> Roman {{architect}} Vitruvius {{said all}} buildings should have three things: strength, utility, and beauty. [...] Vitruvius's work De Architectura, the only surviving {{work on the}} subject from classical antiquity, would have profound influence on architectural theory {{for thousands of years}} to come. Even in space architecture these are some of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> consider. However, <b>the</b> tremendous challenge of living in space has led to habitat design based largely on functional necessity with little or no applied ornament. In this sense space architecture as we know it shares the form follows function principle with modern architecture.|$|R
500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, whatever it may be we stay true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|R

It was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> recorded for <b>the</b> album." [...] It was <b>first</b> played on <b>the</b> guitar just before Dominic Scott left the band, and recorded as a demo the same year with a Yamaha CP70 instead of the guitar.

5000|$|... "Crane and White Lightning" [...] is a {{piece of}} music that Quentin wanted on the soundtrack, but was {{originally}} set for a Metallica track. There’s only one piece of music that I didn’t feel comfortable with when we were done. We lost a sample, I made one Hip Hop beat. I was like I gotta throw one in there. Quentin loved this beat. We rocked with it {{and it was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> did. I could've gotten away with it. It was a sample, but so undetectable. So unnoticeable. I wanted to take a chance, but in the movie business you can’t take those kind of chances. I wouldn’t risk nobody else. If it was my movie, I would have taken a chance. But this is Quentin Tarantino’s movie.|$|R

40|$|While many come to {{librarianship}} {{from other}} careers, I made my third major career {{change to the}} profession after a somewhat atypical process. I made myself {{the subject of a}} formal assessment process while completing a certificate program in career counseling. One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> learned in <b>the</b> career counseling program is that most people take essentially an opportunistic path to their various jobs and careers, e. g., you know someone who does something that sounds sort of interesting, or someone knows someone else who needs someone… It’s often a very generic process and is, in fact, why so many people end up doing jobs that are not a good match for their temperament, interests, and skills. I quickly realized that I {{was one of those people}} who had more or less stumbled into my previous careers...|$|R
5000|$|While the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year olds. Both Sega and Sony {{reasoned}} that because younger players typically {{look up to}} older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then {{there are people who}} start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again." ...|$|R
