40|$|Towing a {{large ship}} in harbour during severe weather {{conditions}} may be fraught with potential hazards, so that accidents during towing operations {{are all too}} common. With regard to the minimization of collision risks, simulation {{can be used as}} a powerful tool to plan safer and safer emergency towing arrangements and procedures. This paper deals with the numerical model developed by the authors to represent the berthing and towing/escorting operations referred to a container ship towed by two tugboats. The virtual scenario, assumed for the simulation, regards a towing operation in emergency situation, due to the high speed of the wind and the accidental loss of the main propulsion of the ship. The wind action on the ship has been modelled by CFD method, used in order to compute forces in correspondence to the actual ship shape and loading condition and to represent the influence of harbour breakwaters upon them. The simulation results, achieved over time, can be successfully employed to investigate particular towing issues, as the proper use of the number and power of tugboats. A good <b>towage</b> <b>service</b> provides towing and general assistance (pulling, pushing, escorting) to facilitate the berthing and mooring operations of large ships...|$|E

The Commission was to report on: {{the impact of}} structural reforms, other measures that could be taken to increase the level of competition in harbour <b>towage</b> and related <b>services,</b> and {{whether there is a}} continuing need for prices oversight of certain harbour <b>towage</b> <b>services</b> and, if so, the most effective forms of price oversight. The Government agreed with the Commission that allowing competitive tenders for the right to provide <b>towage</b> <b>services</b> at ports could promote more competitive towage outcomes, provided certain safeguards were in place to ensure the integrity of the tender process. ports; pilotage; tug boats; port authorities; shipping; ships;...|$|R

The company provides harbour and terminal <b>towage</b> <b>services</b> in over 100 ports and 20 oil and gas terminals across the globe. Svitzer prides itself in safety, reliability and local content. There is a strong focus on sustainability, with three generations of eco-friendly tugs now operating at various ports and terminals in Europe and Australia (including the diesel-electric hybrid tugs operating at Chevron's Gorgon LNG).|$|R

Mylchreest and Capt. Thomas together and there was undoubtedly an agreement made between the two gentlemen for rendering some services, which although not described {{in exactly the same way}} by the pleadings of the respective parties, were services which he had cause to find were substantially <b>towage</b> <b>services</b> rendered by the Satanella to the Fenella.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether exclusive licensing {{of the right to}} provide harbour <b>towage</b> <b>services</b> in ports can provide a superior outcome to open competition has been among the questions that have recently preoccupied Australian policymakers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the arguments for and against the introduction of exclusive licensing of harbour towage by way of a review of the more general literature on franchise bidding. The paper argues that the general policy trend in Australia towards greater acceptance of exclusive licensing arrangements for harbour towage in Australia is misguided because the costs of open entry tend to be overestimated while the practical difficulties of exclusive licensing tend to be underestimated. ...|$|R

50|$|Dr. Phillimore, {{on behalf}} of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, then contended that the {{services}} rendered by the Satanella were no greater than those agreed to be carried out for the sum of £4.Dr. Phillimore asserted that Capt. Thomas had admitted that a great deal had been done for the £4 and it was a hard bargain. The plaintiffs may have had the £200 which had been offered, but they chose not to.Dr. Phillimore then cited various agencies that supported his assertion that the <b>services</b> rendered were <b>towage</b> <b>services,</b> not salvage services, nor even a towage-salvage service, that the evidence showed that the Fenella could have been warped off and beached without the assistance of the Satanella, and it was not represented to Capt.

40|$|Face to high {{unemployment}} and GDP stagnation, competitive ports bear potential positive impacts on regional economic development over their hinterland. Ports are conceived as nodes in global supply chains basing their competitiveness in deriving location, infrastructure, connectivity and supply chain integration advantages for logistics operators. In the current global logistics scenario, port oversupply has increased competition, and global shipping companies are increasingly influential in inserting ports into international maritime routes. This qualitative {{case study is}} a pragmatic research, making use of both new institutional economics to grasp the economic behaviour of port stakeholders, {{and the structure of}} provision approach to guide an institutional analysis on how the attributes of the Port of Valencia provide global shipping companies with competitive advantages. Institutions turn to be relevant in generating advantages such as a privileged connectivity to the centre of the peninsula, an outperforming integrated electronic information interchange system among all members of the port community, or the port authority’s valuable coordination, promotion and leadership of initiatives boosting logistics operators’ competitiveness. Port institutions have also shaped competitive disadvantages, namely the elevated cost of stowage, <b>towage</b> <b>services,</b> some taxes or low productivity of some terminals. The analysis of these findings grounds a discussion on possible adjustments of the port institutional attributes to strengthen the competitive advantages offered to global shipping companies, thus contributing to the regional economic development of the port hinterland. The paper concludes with some challenges for the future and further research tracks...|$|R
