Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E

He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising.

And every 20 or 30 years, he decides {{he needs to get}} a tune up. So he went to the Mayo Clinic, had them give him an entire battery of tests. And as John [...] tells it, they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever. Might even be benefiting him." [...] While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to ignore that.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as [...] "chaotic"; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a [...] "dense, clobbering sledgehammer", while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it [...] "manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis". The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn't leave room for the [...] "nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking," [...] as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as “heavy punk rock”, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. “Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very incorrect statement, because I feel like that’s a very pre-calculated, ‘this is weird because this time signature doesn’t go with this time…’. It’s very planned out. We’re not that smart.” ...|$|E
500|$|To sound a {{theme of}} unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran {{under the banner of}} the National Union Party, rather than the Republicans. At the party's {{convention}} in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, [...] "Andy Johnson, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good man." [...] When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.|$|E
500|$|In the media, Jack is {{described}} as both the [...] "first openly gay companion" [...] and as a [...] "hunky bisexual". Jack's notability {{is largely due to}} his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television, for whom sexual identity is [...] "matter-of-fact", and not an issue. The ordinariness with which Jack's orientation is regarded within Doctor Who embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of homosexuality. The distinct flexibility of Jack's sexuality contributed directly towards the character's popularity and public interest. The overtness of Jack's sexuality broke new grounds, the labels [...] "pansexual" [...] and [...] "omnisexual" [...] being applied to the character on occasion. In [...] "The Parting of the Ways", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips, the latter being the first same-sex kiss {{in the history of the}} program. Despite the boldness of the first lesbian, gay or bisexual character in the series' run, there has been very little uproar about the character, although there was some controversy at the time of Jack's introduction. Speculating, Barrowman tries to link Jack's popularity with this portrayal, noting [...] "I think audiences just get Jack because he's honest ... to finally see a character who doesn't care who he flirts with, I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bit refreshing." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{revealed}} in a flashback in the episode that Smithers was briefly {{married to a}} woman, but the two split up when he devoted too much time to his boss Mr. Burns. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns {{has long been a}} running joke on The Simpsons. His sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a [...] "Burns-sexual" [...] and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay. Matthew Henry wrote in the book Leaving Springfield that this episode is [...] "perhaps the best" [...] example of an attempt to portray an actual gay lifestyle on the show. Henry added that the flashback is a [...] "wonderfully rendered parody of scenes from two of Tennessee Williams's most famous plays, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire. To fully appreciate it, one must know something of not only the two plays cited but also of Williams himself, of his own struggles with both heterosexual and homosexual desires {{and the way in which}} these struggles were incorporated into his art. The creators of The Simpsons offer what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> perfect parallel for the relationship between Smithers and Mr. Burns by combining Williams's two most notable male characters and their defining characteristics: the suppressed homosexual desire of Brick and desperate dependence of Stanley." ...|$|E

Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
