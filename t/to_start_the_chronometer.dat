50|$|The center {{jump ball}} {{that was used}} to restart a game after every {{successful}} field goal was eliminated in 1938, in favor of the ball being given to the non-scoring team from behind the end line where the goal was scored, in order to make play more continuous. The jump ball was still used <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> game and every period, and to restart the game after a held ball. However, the NBA stopped using <b>the</b> jump ball <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> second through fourth quarters in 1975, instead using a quarter-possession system where the loser of the jump ball takes the ball from <b>the</b> other end <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> second and third periods, while the winner of that jump ball takes <b>the</b> ball <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> fourth period {{from the other end of}} the court.|$|R
