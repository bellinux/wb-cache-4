5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing {{a serious threat to}} the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the sky, is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> perihelion of these objects. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
