50|$|Towers {{used for}} {{single-phase}} AC railway <b>traction</b> <b>lines</b> {{are similar in}} construction to those towers used for 110 kV three-phase lines. Steel tube or concrete poles are also often used for these <b>lines.</b> However, railway <b>traction</b> current systems are two-pole AC systems, so <b>traction</b> <b>lines</b> are designed for two conductors (or multiples of two, usually four, eight, or twelve). As a rule, the towers of railway <b>traction</b> <b>lines</b> carry two electric circuits, so they have four conductors. These are usually arranged on one level, whereby each circuit occupies {{one half of the}} cross arm. For four traction circuits the arrangement of the conductors is in two-levels and for six electric circuits the arrangement of the conductors is in three levels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Traction</b> current <b>lines</b> {{are always}} {{equipped}} with an earth conductor. In some cases, two earth conductors are used: for example in, Germany, {{in cases where the}} <b>traction</b> current <b>line</b> is carried on pylons together with three phase AC current, like the line to the nuclear power station at Neckarwestheim. Similarly, in Austria there are some <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> equipped with two earth ropes.|$|R
50|$|Connecticut Railway and Lighting company resumed {{operation}} of the former Waterbury <b>Traction</b> <b>lines</b> in 1936. All local streetcar operations in Waterbury ended on May 22, 1937, and the route to New Haven closed a month later.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, the South Western <b>Traction</b> <b>Line</b> was {{inducted}} to the North America Railway Hall of Fame.

50|$|Clayton was platted in 1816 and at {{that time}} was known as Salem. It {{suffered}} when the National Road bypassed it. In 1906 it became a stop on the Dayton Northern <b>Traction</b> <b>Line.</b> It became a city in 1998 through merger with the rest of Randolph Township, Montgomery County, Ohio.|$|E
50|$|Three {{traction}} substations {{along the}} line take electricity from Wellington Electricity's 11,000-volt distribution network and transform and rectify it to 1500-volt direct current for the overhead <b>traction</b> <b>lines.</b> The substations are located at Wellington (shared with the Kapiti and Hutt Valley Lines), Ngaio and Khandallah.|$|R
50|$|Some {{high voltage}} {{circuits}} are often erected {{on the same}} tower as 110 kV lines. Paralleling circuits of 380 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV-lines on the same towers is common.

50|$|In 1903, Peebles {{expanded}} into Canada. Along with other investors, it formed the Canadian Electric Traction Company and supplied the three-phase equipment, car motors and generators for the South Western Traction Company of London, Ontario. The main line ran 28-miles between London and Port Stanley, a resort town on Lake Erie. It {{was the only}} three-phase <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> in Canada, and was closed in 1918.|$|E
50|$|The {{route of}} the line {{continued}} southward towards St. Thomas, passing through the villages of Scottsville, Tempo and Lynhurst. Tracks reached St. Thomas in July 1906. The <b>Traction</b> <b>Line</b> used the tracks of the St. Thomas Municipal Railway to navigate through the city streets. The line entered town on the west end and exited southward on the east end, crossing over the London and Port Stanley Railway via the street railway on Talbot Street in the process. Continuing southward, the line passed through the village of Union and entered Port Stanley via Colborne Street. The <b>Traction</b> <b>Line</b> station was {{on the east side}} of Port Stanley harbour, compared to the more extensive L&PS yards on the west side. The station was located directly off Colborne Street and still exists today. There was a spur line that ran behind the station down to the dock for loading fish and passengers. The line entered London via Baseline Road, and curved north towards downtown. A long trestle carried the line over the Thames River valley before terminating at the company's station on Horton Street.|$|E
50|$|The Chesapeake Transit Company {{opened an}} {{electric}} <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> from Norfolk to Virginia Beach {{by way of}} Cape Henry in 1902, and the N&S extended its steam line north to Cape Henry to meet the competition. The Norfolk & Southern electrified its beach line in 1904 and purchased the transit company, giving the road two parallel lines up the beach. The steam line was abandoned, and the loop line thus created much {{in the development of}} beach real estate. Electric power was provided by a coal-fired plant at Bayville, on the northern beach route.|$|E
50|$|The Nickel Plate was the key. It traversed Cleveland {{from east}} to west, had a high level {{crossing}} of the Cuyahoga River Valley, and it was adjacent to the proposed terminal. The Nickel Plate also provided a natural route to the proposed terminal for the Van Sweringen's rapid transit and the other <b>traction</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of July 2015, {{construction}} on Line 3 is 90% completed, {{with the construction}} of the Nagole depot almost over, laying of overhead <b>traction</b> <b>lines</b> started, and trial runs of the trains started.

50|$|The {{right of}} way inside the London city limits was sold to the municipality. Belgrave Avenue south of Tecumseh Street follows the old <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> grade. The bridge over the Thames River {{remained}} until it {{was moved to the}} west to carry Richmond Street over the river. The London station building was sold to the Salvation Army and was demolished in the early 1950s when it was replaced. The remaining station buildings were dismantled over the years, save for Port Stanley. The grade can also be seen in various places, mainly south of St. Thomas.|$|E
50|$|The City RR {{came under}} the control of the New Orleans Traction Co. in 1892 as the system was {{prepared}} for electrification. A large order for new electric streetcars was placed with the Brill Co. of Philadelphia. The Canal Line was the first New Orleans <b>Traction</b> <b>line</b> to be electrified, beginning electric service on July 28, 1894. It was followed very quickly by Esplanade and the rest of the company's horsecar lines. The line was extended slightly in the central business district to terminate at the foot of Canal Street, not far from the Mississippi River.|$|E
50|$|The Ontario Light and Traction Company {{purchased}} {{the line on}} June 1, 1900, maintaining local service in the city. In 1901, the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway was chartered {{to build a new}} interurban line between Rochester and Geneva. Headquartered in Canandaigua, the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway leased the Ontario Light and <b>Traction</b> <b>line</b> in 1903 to gain access through the city limits. At this time the power plant in Littleville and the substation on Phoenix Street were abandoned because the Rochester and Eastern had built a larger power plant of its own in Canandaigua. In 1905 the branches serving the fairground and the steamship wharf were abandoned.|$|E
40|$|A sensor {{arrangement}} for detecting irregularities in or on <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> for rail-bound vehicles is proposed, which sensor arrangement comprises {{at least one}} sensor for sensing at least one state variable of the <b>traction</b> current <b>line,</b> an evaluation unit for evaluating sensor signals which are supplied by {{the at least one}} sensor, and a power supply which supplies the at least one sensor and the evaluation unit with voltage and which has a coil for sensing a magnetic field which is generated by a current flowing through the <b>traction</b> current <b>line,</b> and a conversion circuit for converting the current induced by the magnetic field in the coil into storable energy. The at least one sensor, the evaluation unit and the power supply are arranged in a housing which is suitable and is adapted to be a component of a mechanical attachment means of the <b>traction</b> current <b>line</b> such that the magnetic field passes through the coil arranged in the housing...|$|R
50|$|A {{traction}} current pylon is a railroad pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for {{traction current}}. In Germany, <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> with two systems (4 conductor cables) typically have a single level arrangement of the conductor cables. For <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> with four systems (8 conductor cables), the two-level arrangement (4 conductor cables on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest cross bar has four conductor cables {{and each of the}} two highest cross bars have two conductor cables. The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 conductor cables). For the supply of rapid-transit railways operated with alternating current, some overhead line pylons have cross bars for <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> above the contact wire. Other pylons carry electric circuits for traction current and also for three-phase alternating current.|$|R
50|$|Dedicated <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> {{are used}} when {{railways}} are supplied with low-frequency alternating current (AC). The <b>traction</b> current supply <b>line</b> {{is connected to}} substations {{along the line of}} the railway and is usually run separately from the overhead catenary wire from which the locomotives are fed.|$|R
50|$|For {{financial}} reasons, {{however, the}} prospects remained bleak until 1902 when William L. Elder, an Indianapolis realtor and land developer, {{came to the}} rescue. Four miles south of Downtown Indianapolis, near {{the intersection of the}} Pennsylvania Railroad and the Indianapolis, Columbus & Southern <b>Traction</b> <b>Line,</b> Elder was planning to develop a subdivision named Marion Heights. When he became aware of the effort to found a college, he offered to change the name of his proposed subdivision to University Heights; to name all the streets of the subdivision for United Brethren bishops, past or present; to donate 8 acre of land for the college campus; and to erect $40,000 worth of campus buildings. In return he asked the college’s trustees to sell the remaining 446 building lots for him.|$|E
5000|$|Service to Cambridge Springs {{began in}} October 1862, with {{completion}} of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway to Meadville, a [...] railway that originally went from Salamanca to Corry, Pennsylvania until work was suspended in 1861 due to financial issues. The Atlantic and Great Western would later be completed in June 1864, with connection to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad in Dayton, Ohio. Ownership of the line was transferred in 1880 to the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} Erie Railroad. Meanwhile, a trolley line was completed through Cambridge Springs from Meadville, which was completed on October 19, 1900. The trolley station was constructed in 1903. The new Meadville and Cambridge Springs Street Railway was extended to Linesville, Pennsylvania, where it connected to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In November 1912, the railway was merged with the nearby Erie <b>Traction</b> <b>Line,</b> becoming the new Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, a {{group of}} London, Ontario {{residents}} led by Thomas Purdom and Alfred E. Welch chartered an electric railway based in London. Unlike the municipally-owned London and Port Stanley Railway, the South Western Traction Company was chartered primarily as a passenger hauling line. Lines were planned to several other municipalities in the area, but ultimately, the line was a 28-mile meandering route between London and Port Stanley. The line began construction in 1903 southward from London to Lambeth. Construction stopped in 1904 when the company ran out of funds but resumed after additional capital was secured from the Canadian Electric Traction Company, {{a joint venture between}} Canadian and British investors. The generating equipment and rolling stock were supplied by Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh, Scotland. The equipment on the South Western Traction Company used a Three phase AC electric overhead traction system designed by Ganz of Budapest, Hungary.

50|$|<b>Traction</b> current <b>lines</b> are {{operated}} symmetrically against earth. In {{the case}} of 110 kV lines, for example, each conductor has a voltage of 55 kV against earth. The grounding is made in larger substations and in power stations for traction current, using transformers for the cancellation of the earth leakage current. As {{is the case for}} all symmetrical powerlines there are also at <b>traction</b> power <b>lines</b> twisting points. A traction powerline for one circuit has usually two conductors. Since most <b>traction</b> current <b>lines</b> possess two electric circuits, four conductors are on the pylons as a rule (in contrast with three-phase alternating current lines, whose number of conductors are an integral multiple of three).|$|R

50|$|The plat for Joshua {{was first}} {{surveyed}} in 1880, {{and the community}} was organized in 1881 when the railroad arrived. The first store, opened in 1882 by W. L. West, also housed the post office. By 1890 Joshua had a population of 300, two steam corn mill- cotton gins, a hotel, a general store, and a newspaper, the Johnson County Record. The railroad shipped farm produce, Joshua's largest export. The first one-room school opened in 1890, and in 1899 it {{moved into a new}} building. In 1917 this school became Joshua High School. In 1900 and 1912 Joshua suffered major fires. In spite of this, new businesses continued to open. The Citizen's Banking Company, opened in 1904, was run by J. W. Spencer. Two years later a public water system began. Truck gardens, orchards, and corn and cotton farms surrounded Joshua. In 1912 the Fort Worth South <b>Traction</b> <b>Line</b> began to provide service from Cleburne to Fort Worth and had a stop in Joshua. Service stopped in 1932 because of the growing importance of automobile travel. The first car in Joshua was purchased in 1913. By 1914 the community had a population of 824, two cotton gins, an ice plant, a bank, a newspaper named the Joshua Star, and four churches. Local farms grew cotton and potatoes. In the mid-1950s Joshua was incorporated, with Ted Strube as the first mayor. The population dropped to 550 during the 1950s and rose to 924 in 1970. By 1980 it was 1,470. Because of its proximity to Fort Worth, the population grew to 3,828 by 1990. Joshua had fourteen businesses in 1970 and fifty-eight in 1980, when seven local manufacturers made such items as aluminum products, boat trailers, leather goods, and windows. The Joshua Tribune began publication in 1970 and was published until the early 1990s, when it moved to Burleson.|$|E
30|$|Controlling such an MVDC railway grid {{is similar}} to {{controlling}} a conventional DC microgrid. In RES, the train load is continuously moving along the <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> and is changing its position; this makes the <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> resistance between the VSC TSS and train loads a variable quantity. Because of the variable <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> resistance, the VSC TSS near a train experiences less <b>traction</b> <b>line</b> resistance and contributes more power to the system {{as compared to the}} ones at a distance from the train. This behavior can overload renewable energy TSSs and take stiff grid connected TSSs to their maximum limits [11]. The conventional droop control technique improves the current-sharing behavior of the VSC TSS; however, it generates larger voltage deviations in the catenary network (its simulation is described in the next section). Different authors have devised improvements in the droop control technique for more effective current-sharing in conventional DC microgrids. A few of them will be discussed in the next section.|$|E
