5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

Brand was told to wait in the Opera Cafḗ and from there was driven by the SS to Eichmann's headquarters at the Hotel Majestic.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, {{moved to}} Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{in the back}} room of a shop owned by showman Tom Norman. The shop was {{directly}} opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors. Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life.|$|E

5|$|Mark Kinney – A mentally {{unstable}} teen who exhibits many of {{the signs}} of psychopathy. He was adopted by his aunt and uncle after his father {{was killed in a}} fire and his mother told him she never wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Though {{attending}} Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam. He {{also studied}} Afrikaans, hoping {{to build a}} mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. Various official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside of prison. In September 1970, he met British Labour Party politician Dennis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi {{died in a car}} accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. His wife was rarely able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cap'n Tarbell?' ses the cook. 'You don't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im.</b> Why, he's {{the last}} {{man in the world}} you ought <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>see!</b> You don't know 'ow jealous he is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im</b> {{talk like}} that to me, I would," [...] said the cook defiantly, but her cooking from that moment showed a marked improvement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mais, it be new <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>hims</b> fut so big, you oogly Yankee," [...] cried Gibault, putting Waller's cap {{over his}} eyes, and {{running into the}} bush to avoid the consequences.|$|R
5|$|Affeldt {{was born}} in Phoenix, Arizona, to David and Charlotte Affeldt. His father {{was a member of}} the United States Air Force, and Affeldt lived in Guam, Merced, California, and Spokane, Washington, growing up. While in Merced, Affeldt and his father would {{frequently}} attend Oakland Athletics games, and Affeldt enjoyed watching Mark McGwire, Jose Canseco, and Dave Stewart. Affeldt attended Northwest Christian High School, a Division 2-B school in Colbert, Washington. He participated in three sports while there, but it was baseball that drove several major league scouts to the school <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> pitch. He graduated in 1997.|$|E

Black runs upstairs, thinking that Nesbitt will murder his wife, but arrives in time <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> commit suicide by injection instead.|$|E
5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E
6000|$|... "We’ve {{been wanting}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>’im</b> for some time," [...] ses Ginger. [...] "He {{was kind enough}} to lend me arf a crown the other day, and I’ve been wanting to pay ’im." ...|$|R
60|$|Ginger was {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the way 'e took his liquor. Arter {{three or four}} pints he'd expected <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im</b> turn a bit silly, or sing, or do something o' the kind, but Bill kept on as if 'e was drinking water.|$|R

5|$|D0g {{retrieves}} Gordon {{out from}} under some junk outside the Citadel, and Gordon reunites with Alyx, who is relieved <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Alyx contacts Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city, and is informed the Citadel's core is at risk of exploding at any moment. Kleiner states the explosion could {{be large enough to}} level the whole of City 17, and the only way for them to survive is to re-enter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown. Eli reluctantly agrees when he sees no other option.|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving {{his head}} like a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu had decided to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{asked my}} 'usband {{to stay in}} because you wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im,</b> but he would go out.

5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} remove it. Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|His story complete, Tom awakens to find Anne by his side. She {{tells him}} she knew he’d return for his sons. He tells {{her that he}} came back for her too. Tom then reunites with his {{children}} before greeting fellow members of the 2nd Mass.

5|$|In the manga {{illustrated}} by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after {{the conclusion of}} the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the park. Also, at {{the conclusion of the}} story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her at their hotel wedding.|$|E
60|$|O' course, {{everybody}} {{left off}} looking at once {{when they heard}} about Bob-- not that they believed that he'd be such a fool as to keep the cat in his 'ouse; and that evening, {{as soon as it}} was dark, Joe Clark went round <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im.</b>|$|R

Though surrounded by the British troops, Kattabomman fights and escapes, but his Minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai, is captured by the British.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2009, around 20 {{security}} agents {{broke into}} the home of Wang Yonghang. Wang, a Weiquan lawyer from Dalian City, had defended Falun Gong adherents. He {{was taken into custody}} for interrogation and was reportedly beaten severely. Wang's lawyers were not permitted to contact him. In November 2009, Wang was sentenced in a closed court to seven years in prison for his advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong practitioners. When his lawyers were permitted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in January 2010, they reported that he had been tortured.|$|E
60|$|He {{went without}} the next night, but 'e {{was such a}} generous man that 'e would pay every fourth time, {{and there was no}} {{pleasure}} to the other chaps <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im</b> pay and 'ave nothing out of it. It spoilt their evening, and owing to 'aving only about 'arf wot they was accustomed to they all got up very disagreeable next morning.|$|R
