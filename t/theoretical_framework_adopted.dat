The ellipsis analysis cannot, however, so easily account for the systematic variation in forms seen with possessives, since it suggests {{that there should be no}} such variation. The covert pronoun analysis can easily accommodate the fact that N-ellipsis has a distribution that is close to that of the indefinite pronoun one, but it too has difficulty with the systematic variation in forms seen with possessives. Both analyses are challenged by the fact that they cannot explain why N-ellipsis is limited in occurrence in English to a relatively small number of pre-nominal elements. Both are also challenged by the observation that the null element must be [...] "introduced".|$|E

Recent work suggests quantifying the imperfect substitutability relationship between migrants and natives as a measure for the hurdles migrants have to face.

Studies have been conducted mainly at small temporal and spatial scales, though the latter is increasing over time.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis, a new policy paradigm has emerged in which old-fashioned policies such as capital controls and other government distortions have become part of the standard policy tool kit (so called macro- prudential policies). On the wave of this seemingly unanimous policy consensus, a new strand of theoretical literature contends that capital controls are welfare enhancing and can be justified rigorously because of second-best considerations. Within the same <b>theoretical</b> <b>framework</b> <b>adopted</b> in this fast-growing literature, this paper shows that a credible commitment to support the exchange rate in crisis times always welfare-dominates prudential capital controls, as it can achieve unconstrained allocation. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{factors that}} {{contribute}} toward incidental sun exposure are relatively unexplored. Incidental sun exposure is neither planned nor deliberate, thus <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> <b>adopted</b> for its exploration must account for this. The current study adopts the prototype willingness (PW) model {{as a framework for}} examining incidental exposure in an extreme ultra-violet radiation (UVR) environment. Method: An experimental 1 -factor design with three levels aimed to manipulate the favourability of the incidental exposer prototype. Community participants (N= 96) were exposed to positive or negative information about the prototypical incidental exposer. Participants responded to items assessing PW model variables and sun-related behaviour. Skin reflectance spectrophotometry was used to measure skin colour at T 1 and T 2 (1 -month later). Findings: Preliminary findings after wave 1 recruitment suggest that the manipulation was effective with within-group differences detected for prototype favourability ratings. Discussion: Findings suggest that the PW model provides a useful framework for examining an underlying mechanism of incidental sun exposure behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty {{in extreme}} sports {{performance}} environments, like rock and ice climbing, provides considerable psycho-emotional and physiological demands which challenge {{the acquisition of}} perceptual-motor skills. An ecological dynamics <b>theoretical</b> <b>framework</b> <b>adopts</b> concepts and tools of nonlinear dynamics and ecological psychology to investigate and model the relationships that emerge in extreme sports between athletes and their performance environments. In this relation, the interactions of athletes with key objects, surfaces, events and significant others during a sport like climbing emerge from interdependent personal, task and environmental constraints on performance. Performance behaviours emerge through the continuous and active exploration of environmental properties by individual athletes. Properties of rock cliffs, icefalls and mountains provide {{a high level of}} uncertainty due to continuous weather-driven changes. Their unpredictability signifies that performance may be considered as an ongoing coadaptation of climber’s behaviours to dynamically changing, interacting constraints, individually perceived and encountered. In this chapter, we consider the continuous interactions between climbers and their environment to understand how they can be coached to perceive key environmental properties when climbing and adapt their behaviours towards achieving performance goal...|$|R

We present multiple case analysis of publicly available documents and court papers (in the United Kingdom and Nigeria) to document instances of breach and areas of weakness in the existing Nigerian code of corporate governance.

With the Boko Haram insurgency attacks, the number of internally displaced persons {{in the northern part}} of the country rose tremendously. In addressing this crisis in the country, efforts of the government have not been pleasing and encouraging. This paper is therefore set to interrogate the extent to which the internally displaced persons affect human security in northern Nigeria. Forced migration and social inclusion theories were the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> <b>adopted</b> for the study while it relies on primary and secondary sources of data for analysis. Findings of the study reveals that measures of the government in addressing the crisis of internally displaced persons in the country is on ad-hoc basis with no solid and durable solution in view. In addition, the crisis of internally displaced persons hinders immensely the developmental process of the region. The paper therefore advocates for the inclusion of the internally displaced persons’ affairs at the local government level thereby establishing offices for the representatives of these displaced persons. The increments of funds to enhance and protect human security amongst the citizens are alternative measures in addressing the crisis of internally displaced persons in the country thereby enhancing human security in the region...|$|R

30|$|It {{is evident}} that the current public {{research}} impact literature has several issues that require attention. First, most studies assumed linear knowledge flow from universities/PRIs to the industry to achieve commercial spill-overs and deliver economic impact (Smith et al. 2011). Second, the lack of clear and consistent definition about the term “impact” and its host of related indicators {{may be seen in}} the diverse metrics used in the studies: R&D intensity (Nelson 1986), invention disclosures (Carlsson and Fridh 2002), publications (Nelson 2009), patents (Fischer and Varga 2003), technology licenses with companies (Bach and Llerena 2007), academic spin-offs (Colombo et al. 2010), innovative sales from licensees (Vincett 2010), as well as employment and income (Armstrong 1993). Third, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frameworks</b> <b>adopted</b> varied widely from resource-based theory (Colombo et al. 2010) and CDM (Barajas et al. 2012) to input-output model (Roessner et al. 2013) and total factor productivity (Fischer and Varga 2003), while the methodologies ranged from individual case study (Brownrigg 1973) to econometric analysis (Felsenstein 1996). The use of different theoretical and methodological approaches has certainly enriched the literature with multi-disciplinary perspectives. However, these have also fragmented the literature, making it difficult for scholars and policy makers to perform meaningful international benchmarking of their innovation impact to inform policy and direct future research (Roessner et al. 2013, Penfield et al. 2014).|$|R

Moreover, it turns out that part of transition-adjusted welfare gains stems from the temporary increase in labor supply which accounts for the increase in the interest rate.
