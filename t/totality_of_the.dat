5|$|Tara K. Allen, {{arguing for}} Alvarado, {{claimed that the}} state court's {{decision}} was objectively unreasonable {{because they did not}} consider the <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane. Specifically, the considered circumstances of custody were not total because Alvarado's age was not considered. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, custody is an objective test and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as the <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only {{participated in the}} oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E

500|$|In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, the United States Supreme Court {{established}} {{a framework for}} determining whether a suspect's consent is voluntary.

Consequently, the Court held that voluntariness should be determined [...] "from <b>the</b> <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> circumstances". The Court also clarified that judges should examine the [...] "possibly vulnerable subjective state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person who consents" [...] {{to determine whether a}} suspect was coerced into consenting, and [...] "account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions". However, the Court also held that suspects may still give valid consent even if they do not know that they can refuse to consent to the search.|$|R

25|$|Hahnemann {{believed}} {{the underlying causes}} of disease were phenomena that he termed miasms, and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using a process of homeopathic dilution, in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being bashed against an elastic material, commonly a leather-bound book. Dilution typically continues well past the point where no molecules of the original substance remain. Homeopaths select homeopathics by consulting reference books known as repertories, and by considering the <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.|$|E

The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{alleged that the}} speed and <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German {{collapse}} were caused by Romanian betrayal. For example, Heinz Guderian wrote of Romanian betrayal in his book Panzer Leader. The study of the combat operations by Mazulenko indicates that this is probably not correct. Romanian formations did resist the Soviet attack in many cases, but were ill-equipped to defend themselves effectively against a modern army {{due to a lack}} of modern anti-tank, artillery, and anti-air weapons. In contrast to German claims, for instance, in the symposium notes published by David Glantz, or in the history of the Offensive published by Kissel, it appears that Romanian 1st Armoured Division did offer resistance against the Soviet breakthrough. However, Mark Axworthy states in his book that the battered 1st Armoured Division maintained cohesion, experiencing some local, costly successes before being forced to cross the River Moldova. Axworthy claims that the postwar Communist government would have obviously used this act of betrayal for propaganda purposes. Also, there are no Soviet reports of collaboration before 24 August 1944. The Soviet rates of progress imply a rather ineffective defense of the Romanian troops than active collaboration and en-masse surrender.|$|E

25|$|On {{the death}} of Miro, his son Eburic was made king, but {{apparently}} not before sending tokens of appreciation and of friendship to Leovigild. Not a year later his brother-in-law, named Audeca, accompanied by the army seized power. He took Eburic into a monastery and ordered him a priest, so preventing him regaining the throne. Then Audeca married Siseguntia, king Miro's widow, and made himself king. This usurpation and the friendship granted by Eboric gave Leovigild the opportunity to seize the neighboring kingdom. In 585 Leovigild went to war against the Sueves, invading Galicia. In words of John of Biclaro: “King Leovigild devastates Galicia and deprives Audeca of the <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom; the nation of the Sueves, their treasure and fatherland are conduced to his own power {{and turned into a}} province of the Goths.” During the campaign, the Franks of king Guntram attacked Septimania, maybe trying to help the Sueves, at the same time sending ships to Galicia which were intercepted by Leovigild's troops, who took their cargo and killed or enslaved most of their crews. Thus was the kingdom transferred to the Goths as one of their three administrative regions, Gallaecia, Hispania and Galia Narboniensis. Audeca, captured, was tonsured and ordered a priest, then sent into exile in Beja, in Southern Lusitania.|$|E
