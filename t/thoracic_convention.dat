40|$|Abstract*The {{performance}} of six thoracic sampler types has been assessed against the CEN/ISO <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention.</b> Samplers tested included the CATHIA thoracic sampler, a modi"ed {{form of the}} SIMPEDS cyclone, the IOM thoracic sampler, the GK 2. 69 thoracic cyclone, a modi"ed IOM inhalable sampler with a foam plug insert and a modi"ed cowled sampler of the type usually used for sampling "bres. Penetration measurements were carried out using an aerodynamic particle sizer-based system with an e!ective operating range extending up to 20 km. Results of measurements on isolated samplers under calm air conditions showed the GK 2. 69 and modi"ed SIMPEDS cyclones to agree well with the <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention.</b> Measurements on internal separation e$ciency indicated that both the IOM thoracic sampler and modi"ed IOM inhalable sampler would operate close to the convention at wind speeds between 0. 5 and 4 m s~ 1. Penetration measurements on the CATHIA sampler showed it to oversample {{with respect to the}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention,</b> although there were small discrepancies between data from this study and measurements made elsewhere. The modi"ed cowled sampler measurements indicated that there would be signi"cant bias with respect to the <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention</b> for some lognormal aerosol distributions. However, the modi"cation was exceptionally cost e!ective, and may be worth developing further. Crown Copyright (1999 Published b...|$|E
40|$|High {{flow rate}} respirable size {{selective}} samplers, GK 4. 126 and FSP 10 cyclones, were calibrated for thoracic-size selective sampling {{in two different}} laboratories. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) utilized monodisperse ammonium fluorescein particles and scanning electron microscopy to determine the aerodynamic particle size of the monodisperse aerosol. Fluorescein intensity was measured to determine sampling efficiencies of the cyclones. The Health Safety and Laboratory (HSL) utilized a real time particle sizing instrument (Aerodynamic Particle Sizer) and polydisperse glass sphere particles and particle size distributions between the cyclone and reference sampler were compared. Sampling efficiency of the cyclones were compared to the <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention</b> defined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) /Comit 39 Europ 39 en de Normalisation (CEN) /International Standards Organization (ISO). The GK 4. 126 cyclone showed minimum bias compared to the <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention</b> at flow rates of 3. 5 l 20 min(- 1) (NIOSH) and 2. 7 - 3. 3 l 20 min(- 1) (HSL) and the difference may be {{from the use of}} different test systems. In order to collect the most dust and reduce the limit of detection, HSL suggested using the upper end in range (3. 3 l 20 min(- 1)). A flow rate of 3. 4 l 20 min(- 1) would be a reasonable compromise, pending confirmation in other laboratories. The FSP 10 cyclone showed minimum bias at the flow rate of 4. 0 l 20 min(- 1) in the NIOSH laboratory test. The high flow rate thoracic-size selective samplers might be used for higher sample mass collection in order to meet analytical limits of quantification.

40|$|Several {{recommendations}} {{have been}} made to the effect that the most appropriate health-based size-selective criterion for fibers is the <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention</b> of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The performance of two thoracic samplers, the CATHIA-T (37 -mm filter) and the GK 2. 69 cyclone (37 -mm filter), was investigated against the standard 25 -mm cowled sampler (current NIOSH 7400 standardmethod) to determine the effect of thoracic sampling on field results. A total of 270 samples: 80 field and 10 field blank samples for each sampler type, were taken from seven stations in the processing mill of an iron ore mine whose ore contains amphibole minerals. Slides were prepared using the dimethyl formamide/Euparal technique and relocatable cover slips. Two counters examined the slides according to NIOSH 7400 counting A rules with phase contrast microscopes. Prior to counting the sample slides, four reference slides were randomly selected and counted three times on different days to com-pare the coefficient of variation (CV) between and within counters. Also, seven reference slides were chosen to explore variability between the two microscopes. The average CV between counters (0. 148) showed slightly higher than the average CVs within counters (0. 072 for Counter 1 and 0. 119 for Counter 2). The average CV between the two microscopes wa...|$|E
40|$|The {{counting}} of fibres on membrane filters {{could be}} facilitated by using size-selective samplers to exclude coarse particulate and fibres that impede fibre counting. Furthermore, {{the use of}} thoracic size selection would also remove the present requirement to discriminate fibres by diameter during counting. However, before thoracic samplers become acceptable for sampling fibres, their performance with fibres needs to be determined. This study examines the performance of four thoracic samplers: the GK 2. 69 cyclone, a Modified SIMPEDS cyclone, the CATHIA sampler (inertial separation) and the IOM thoracic sampler (porous foam pre-selector). The uniformity of sample deposit on the filter samples, which is important when counts are taken on random fields, was examined with two sizes of spherical particles (1 and 10 mm) and a glass fibre aerosol with fibres spanning the aerodynamic size range of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>convention.</b> Counts by optical microscopy examined fields on a set scanning pattern. Hotspots of deposition were detected {{for one of the}} thoracic samplers (Modified SIMPEDS with the 10 mm particles and the fibres). These hotspots were attributed to the inertial flow pattern near the port from the cyclone pre-separator. For the other three thoracic samplers, the distribution was similar to that on a cowled sampler, the current standard sampler for fibres. Aerodynamic selection wa...|$|E
