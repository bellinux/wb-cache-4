2500|$|The 2010 ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Brita case {{confirmed}} that products {{originating in the}} West Bank do not qualify for preferential customs treatment under the EC–Israel Agreement, and that contrary assertions by Israeli authorities are not binding upon EU customs authorities. In its reasoning, the ECJ relied {{on the presence of}} two, distinct and equal Association agreements, one with Israel, applying to the [...] "territory of the State of Israel", and one with the PLO, applying to the territory of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and on the general principle of customary international law that an obligation cannot be imposed on a third party without its consent. The Court concluded that the EC–Israel Agreement may not be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to compel the Palestinian authorities to waive their right to exercise the competence conferred upon them by virtue of the EC–PLO Agreement and, in particular, to refrain from exercising the right to issue customs documents providing proof of origin for goods manufactured in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It follows that products originating in the West Bank do not fall within the <b>territorial</b> <b>scope</b> of the EC–Israel Agreement and, therefore, do not qualify for preferential treatment under that agreement.|$|E

There is a tension between a liberal ideal of free movement and democratic concerns about the integrity of citizenship. This text proposes first to break down the problem by introducing a typology of free movement regimes based on their personal and <b>territorial</b> <b>scopes.</b> Second, it argues that the tension can be partially overcome through supranational integration, toleration of multiple citizenship and international agreements on reciprocal free movement rights. Taken together, these three strategies can greatly expand free movement rights that are not in conflict with democratic 3 citizenship since they rely on an expanded conception of such citizenship. The analysis concludes, however, that even the best possible free movement regimes that can be imagined under present circumstances cannot fully overcome discriminatory features of immigrant admission policies...|$|R

30|$|Restriction {{landscape}} raises several issues: {{in terms}} of policies, e.g. to what degree and how territory government tools accept the idea of cultural landscape; or from a disciplinary point of view, such as analysis, interpretation and settlement methods of a potential intervention on the land. Moreover, given the historical density and geographic variety of Italian territory where it could be enforced, {{it seems like it}} won’t make room (literally) for the integration of renewable energies and those transformations aimed at achieving neither environmental, nor economic or social sustainability objectives. On one hand, the denial of transformation or transformability risks condemning the land to develop a “museum-like” aspect, immediately evoking the age-old opposition between valorisation and preservation; 1 on the other, further possible interpretations generated by the static-conservative approach leave some doubts about efficiency {{in terms of}} temporal continuity, and produce a landscape representing a culturally controversial and contradictory society from the legislation systems’ perspective. Mitigation landscape, in particular, forms several design choices or the good practice of some regulation tools, manifesting itself in the guise of both visual concealment—an unhistorical but efficient compromise between aesthetics and performance 2 —and mimesis, whose results are disparate but often very close to a camouflage of forms and materials sometimes verging on grotesque. 3 Unfortunately, the technological innovation developed by component producers moves even in this kind of market, offering hybrid and poorly integrated solutions—technological fakes such as solar tiles, imitation slate slabs or solar panels disguised as roof windows, where the relation shape/function is disrupted to the benefit of kitsch. At the same time, the technological pastiche responds both to a deviation of taste and the heterogeneity between local regulation (building codes, colour plans, etc.) and regional or national laws (legislation on energy efficiency) or among different but often neighbouring <b>territorial</b> <b>scopes.</b> In this respect, regulations on the installation of solar panels in areas subject to landscape and environmental restriction (from the historic centre to the restricted buffer zones near drainage basins) are a perfect example. First they’ve been forbidden, then submitted to the superintendent’s opinion—with all the resulting consequences—and finally used when applying to a regional administrative court in order to define the priority of “the discrepancies with landscape’s peculiarities” or “the overriding public interest” deriving from low-impact energy production.|$|R

A special attention is given to the institution "Klub tanečních mistrů v království Českém", unifying dancing masters at the end of the 19 th century. The author also deals with questions and origin of usage of significant titles of dancing masters (Provincial, Estates).

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a philosophical {{account of the}} morality of extraterritorial punishment. The introduction clarifies the methodology by putting forward an analytical account of moral rights and endorsing the interest-based theory of rights, and presents a normative appraisal of the moral significance of political boundaries. Chapter 1 presents an innovative interest-based justification {{for the right to}} punish. Chapter 2 examines the extraterritorial scope of this right to punish with regards to domestic offences. It argues that the justification here advocated is the best suited to account for the strong intuition that the right to punish should be primarily <b>territorial</b> in <b>scope,</b> and {{provides a}} critique of the principles for states' power to punish offences committed extraterritorially currently in force under international law. The next part of the thesis focuses on extraterritoriality in the context of international criminal law. Chapter 3 argues that the defining feature of the concept of an international crime is that it warrants conferring upon some extraterritorial body the power to punish their perpetrators regardless of the nationality of both offender and victim. Chapter 4 provides a fresh look at universal and international jurisdiction, i. e., at the theoretical explanation for the proposition that every state {{should have the right to}} punish international crimes and the scope of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Chapter 5 provides a theory of legitimate authority to punish offenders. It relies on an innovative application of the influential service conception of authority to this specific question and permits a philosophical examination of issues such as show trials, victor's justice, tu quoque, and trials in absentia or against defendants who have been abducted abroad. A conclusion summarizes the central findings of the thesis and suggests possible avenues for future research...|$|R

40|$|Norway's {{regional}} structure is under debate as questions about <b>territorial</b> boundaries, scale, <b>scope</b> of tasks and responsibilities, and decision-making structures {{have become an}} issue in Norwegian politics. This tendency of changing the scale of public action with regard to governmental structures, economic politics, welfare, and civic society has been termed ‘new regionalism’. New regionalism often comes under criticism of being too neo-liberalistic or too economically orientated, leaving in its wake debates of democratic accountability and the neglect of ‘soft factors’ (i. e. socio-culture, identity, consciousness, and participation). In this article the authors investigate whether new democratic or semi-democratic regional organisations as advocated by new regionalist schemes require identification amongst the local population {{in order to be}} successful and enduring governmental structures. Further, it is shown how too simplistic understandings of the social processes, and their inherent power aspects, involved in the implementation of the new regionalist development scheme ‘Mountain Region’ distort the undertaking. The authors find that a more complex relational and contextual understanding is in demand, one in which regionalisation is not only recognised as a process which diffuses across time-space, but also takes an asymmetrical place across society's social fabric, and one where ‘soft factors’ such as ‘regional identity’ are not sidestepped...|$|R

40|$|Meeting the {{commitments}} {{made in the}} Paris Agreement on climate change will require different approaches in different countries. However, a common feature in many contexts relates to the continued and sometimes increasing significance of the carbon footprints of urban centres. These footprints consider both production or <b>territorial</b> (i. e. <b>Scope</b> 1 and 2) emissions, and consumption or extra-territorial (i. e. Scope 3) emissions. Although {{a growing number of}} cities have adopted targets for their production-based emissions, very few have even started to analyse or address their consumption-based emissions. This presents a potential challenge for urban policymaking if consumption emissions rise while production emissions fall, and for climate mitigation more broadly if emissions are effectively migrating to areas without carbon reduction targets or capabilities. To explore these issues, in this paper we analyse and compare production- and consumption-based emissions accounts for urban centres in China, the UK and the US. Results show that per-capita income and population density are strong predictors of consumption-based emissions levels, and consumption-based emissions appear to diminish but not decouple with higher per-capita incomes. In addition, results show that per-capita income is a predictor of net emissions - or the difference between production- and consumption-based accounts - suggesting that continuing increases in per capita income levels may drive the ‘leakage’ of urban emissions. These findings highlight a risk in placing too much faith in city-level climate strategies focused only on production-based emissions, and stress the importance of new city-level initiatives that focus on consumption-based emissions, especially in cities that are shifting from producer to consumer city status...|$|R
40|$|Whereas the {{existence}} of space law as the specific body of law applicable to either outer space as an area or to outer space activities tacitly implies a distinction between space law and general international law, thus presenting the question of its <b>territorial</b> or material <b>scope,</b> military activities have developed without regard for such theoretical divides. Instead, they operate in a continuum of physical and military opportunity, ever seeking for advantage over the adversary. This {{does not imply that}} no law applies to them. What it does imply, however, is that applying discrete legal systems to continuous activities may not be straightforward. This article seeks answers to two interrelated questions: which bodies of law apply to military space activities, and what can the practical application of these bodies of law to military space activities teach us about their respective scope? In answering the first question, the article, in its second and third sections, presents an overview of the main concepts and practical implications of concurrently applying general international law, the law of armed conflict, and international space law to military space activities. In doing so, it highlights a number of practical questions and manifest voids that, today, preclude the coherent regulation of military space activities. In spite of these voids, the article finds that existing legal systems contain most, if not all of the principles that, if applied creatively and in good faith, should permit the rule of law to govern military space activities. De lege ferenda, the article concludes that the law should evolve to become more reflective of practice, and rely less on artificial distinctions. To this end, it advocates a nuanced interpretation of existing space law provisions and the development of authoritative interpretations that allow the practical application of international humanitarian law in a space context. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. To {{begin our}} {{theoretical}} journey, students of European 'polity-formation' {{are confronted with}} a fundamental theoretical challenge: to conceptualise the emerging patterns of interaction between the collectivity and the segments by {{taking into account the}} intersection of different theoretical approaches. The aim is to enhance our understanding of the structural properties and operational dynamics of European governance after the formal conclusion of yet another formal treaty revision. However one classifies the end-product of the 1996 / 97 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), the following set of questions warrant our attention. What is new about European integration in the 1990 s? Is it possible to classify the emerging European polity under a comprehensive model of governance? If 'yes', then what conceptual and analytical lenses should be used? What are the limits and possibilities of an 'ever closer union' among distinct, yet highly interdependent, polities? Has a terminal state of integration become discernible? Finally, what is the dominant character of the relationship between democracy (as indirect demos control) and integration (as polity-formation) ? These questions form part of a wider research agenda which revolves around a plurality of interrelated issues: the future of the European state system; the viability of democratic arrangements within and across pre-established borders; novel forms of large-scale community-building, multiple identity-holding and formal constitutional engineering; the locus of sovereignty over an ever expanding array of transnational activities; the relationship between the functional <b>scope,</b> <b>territorial</b> scale and integrative level of joint decision-making; the institutionalisation of new avenues of political communication, and the question of citizen identification with EU structures. The above list may well be extended to cover most areas of regional political life, cutting across the conventional disciplines {{in the study of the}} EU. In this article, such an ensemble of concepts and ideas is treated within the wider theoretical laboratory of European 'polity-formation': the creation of a profound locking together of distinct culturally defined and politically organised units within a larger, purposive whole...|$|R
