40|$|The {{possibility}} of optimizing certain fermentation conditions towards the <b>total</b> <b>unit</b> <b>productivity</b> of several enzymes has been investigated. As a model system, {{we used a}} particular strain of Aspergillus niger capable of simultaneously producing significant levels of superoxide dismutase, glucose oxidase, and catalase. The fermentation parameters used in the optimization were the fermentation time, and the concentration of carbon and nitrogen source. The optimum set of fermentation parameters for maximum production of each enzyme has initially been determined. The introduction of a value factor for each enzyme unit of specific purity yields the conclusion {{that there is a}} point in the parameter space, different from that of optimum production of each separate enzyme, where a maximum exists for the total unit value of the three enzymes produced.

This example reveals the difficulty to interpret the <b>total</b> <b>productivity</b> change correctly. The combination of volume increase and <b>total</b> <b>productivity</b> decrease leads in this case to the improved performance because we are on the “diminishing returns” area of the production function. If we are on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, the combination of production volume increase and <b>total</b> <b>productivity</b> increase leads to improved production performance. Unfortunately we do not know in practice on which part of the production function we are.
