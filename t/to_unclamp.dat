25|$|One type of non-homologous based {{mechanism}} is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are {{also involved in}} repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another {{mechanism is}} the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one dicentric chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading {{to an increase in}} copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required <b>to</b> <b>unclamp</b> and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and {{it is unlikely that the}} polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.|$|E

Ingram was arrested and taken to London in October 1624. Such was the evidence presented to the resulting Exchequer Commission that Ingram was obliged to surrender the business in February 1625. However, through his favour with the King, and the larger processes surrounding the Statute of Monopolies of May 1624, he escaped from the affair very lightly.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{prevailing}} {{consensus is}} that the 2010 Mw 7. 0 Haiti earthquake left the Enriquillo– Plantain Garden strike-slip Fault (EPGF) unruptured but broke unmapped blind north-dipping thrusts. Using high-resolution topography, aerial images, bathymetry and geology we identified previously unrecognized south-dipping NW-SE-striking active thrusts in southern Haiti. One of them, Lamentin thrust (LT), cuts across the crowded city of Carrefour, extends offshore into Port-au-Prince Bay and connects at depth with the EPGF. We propose that both faults broke in 2010. The rupture likely initiated on the thrust and propagated further along the EPGF due <b>to</b> <b>unclamping.</b> This scenario is consistent with geodetic, seismological and field data. The 2010 earthquake increased the stress toward failure on the unruptured segments of the EPGF and on neighboring thrusts, significantly increasing the seismic hazard in the Port-au-Prince urban area. The numerous active thrusts recognized in that area must be considered for future evaluation of the seismic hazard...|$|R
5000|$|A {{radial arm}} drill press {{is a large}} geared head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is <b>to</b> <b>unclamp,</b> move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm drill presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The Radial Arm Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|E

The group C received an equivalent volume of saline solution. Systemic hemodynamics, renal artery blood flow, renal cortical blood flow (RCBF), renal vascular resistance, and renal function were compared. Following the aortic unclamping, cardiac output and RCBF were less attenuated, and the systemic and renal vascular resistance was elevated to a lesser degree in the group Mg compared to the group C. There was no significant difference in the plasma renin activity, serum creatinine and Cystatin-C between the two groups. The present study shows that Mg infusion improves systemic hemodynamics and RCBF after aortic unclamping.

40|$|Many of Earth’s great {{earthquakes}} {{occur on}} thrust faults. These earthquakes predominantly occur within subduction zones, {{such as the}} 2011 moment magnitude 9. 0 eathquake in Tohoku-Oki, Japan, or along large collision zones, such as the 1999 moment magnitude 7. 7 earthquake in Chi-Chi, Taiwan. Notably, these two earthquakes had a maximum slip that {{was very close to}} the surface. This contributed to the destructive tsunami that occurred during the Tohoku-Oki event and to the large amount of structural damage caused by the Chi-Chi event. The mechanism that results in such large slip near the surface is poorly understood as shallow parts of thrust faults are considered to be frictionally stable. Here we use earthquake rupture experiments to reveal the existence of a torquing mechanism of thrust fault ruptures near the free surface that causes them <b>to</b> <b>unclamp</b> and slip large distances. Complementary numerical modelling of the experiments confirms that the hanging-wall wedge undergoes pronounced rotation in one direction as the earthquake rupture approaches the free surface, and this torque is released as soon as the rupture breaks the free surface, resulting in the unclamping and violent ‘flapping’ of the hanging-wall wedge. Our results imply that the shallow extent of the seismogenic zone of a subducting interface is not fixed and can extend up to the trench during great earthquakes through a torquing mechanism...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the effects on}} cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) of intermittent opening of the venoarterial bridge (VA bridge) during {{venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation}} (VA-ECMO). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study in 22 newborns during VA ECMO. CBFV was measured in the pericallosal artery by Doppler ultrasound. Changes in peak systolic flow velocity (PSV), end diastolic flow velocity (EDV) and time-averaged mean flow velocity (TAM) on day 1, 2, 3, and 5 and at low ECMO flow (50 - 150 ml/min) were analyzed (mean percentage+/-standard deviation (t-tests, p 25 % were considered relevant. The relationship between changes in CBFV and ECMO flow rate (Pearson correlation, p< 0. 01) was studied. RESULTS: Opening of the VA bridge resulted in statistically significant and relevant decreases in PSV (35 +/- 18 %), EDV (93 +/- 15 %) and TAM (68 +/- 13 %), persisting during the consecutive days of treatment. Smaller changes in CBFV at low ECMO flow were statistically significant and mostly relevant: PSV (15 +/- 7 %), EDV (76 +/- 21 %) and TAM (40 +/- 12 %). Changes in CBFV were positively correlated to the ECMO flow. CONCLUSION: Use of the VA bridge results in significant and relevant ECMO flow-dependent changes in CBFV, persisting during the treatment.

40|$|This paper, for {{the first}} time, investigates the {{reliability}} of wire-bonded low-voltage discrete power trench n-MOSFETs that have been subjected <b>to</b> repetitive <b>unclamped</b> inductive switching (RUIS). Automotive MOSFETs driving inductive loads may be subjected to RUIS; hence, {{there is a need}} to characterize the failure mechanisms in such applications. The failure mechanisms of repetitively avalanched wire-bonded MOSFETs are shown to be wire-bond lift-off and source metal degradation/fatigue due to thermomechanical stress cycling. Temperature excursions from avalanche pulses cause thermomechanical stresses on the wire-bond/source-metal interface as a result of differences in thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and aluminum. Trench MOSFETs exhibited an average of 10 % increase in on-state resistance due to source metal fatigue after 100 million cycles of repetitive avalanche. The number of cycles to failure is investigated as a function of the avalanched induced temperature changes and is shown to follow the Coffin-Manson law. These results are important for designers of automotive systems since they are capable of predicting the long-term reliability of wire-bonded discrete power semiconductor components...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{describe}} {{our experience}} with a new technique of total laparoscopic bypass surgery to treat aortoiliac occlusive lesions. Material and methodsFrom November 2000 to December 2003, 93 total laparoscopic bypass procedures were performed to treat TASC (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus document) grade C or D aortoiliac occlusive lesions. We also reimplanted 2 inferior mesenteric arteries, and performed 3 prosthesis–superior mesenteric bypasses and 2 suprarenal aorta endarterectomies. Our technique includes a sloping right lateral decubitus installation, which enables a simple transperitoneal left retrocolic or retrorenal approach to the infrarenal abdominal aorta. In patients with a hostile abdomen a retroperitoneal videoscopic approach was used. Aorta-prosthesis laparoscopic anastomoses are performed simply, which averts any trauma to the suture material. ResultsPatients included 76 men and 17 women, with median patient age 61 years (range, 38 - 79 years). The approach to the aorta was always possible, in particular, in obese patients. It enabled stable aortic exposure during performance of the laparoscopic aorta-prosthesis anastomosis. Median operative time was 240 minutes (range, 150 - 450 minutes). Median aortic clamping time measured <b>to</b> <b>unclamping</b> of the first prosthetic limb was 67. 5 minutes (range, 30 - 135 minutes). Median duration of aorta-prosthesis anastomosis was 30 minutes (range, 12 - 90 minutes). The longest durations were mainly observed during the learning curve. Thirty-day postoperative mortality was 4 % (4 of 93 patients). Two patients died of myocardial infarction. One patient with American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 4 disease operated on to treat critical ischemia died of multiple organ system failure, and 1 patient died of colonic ischemia. Major nonlethal postoperative complications were observed in 4 patients, and included lung atelectasia in 2 patients, graft infection in 1 patient operated on emergently to treat aortic occlusion, and secondary spleen rupture at day 5 in 1 patient. Median hospital stay was 7 days (range, 2 - 57 days). With a mean follow-up of 19 months (range, 1 - 37 months), complete recovery was observed in 89 patients, and all grafts were patent. One patient had kinking of a prosthetic limb at the groin, and in 1 patient Staphylococcus epidermidis graft infection developed, which was treated with in situ replacement with a rifampin-bonded graft. ConclusionTotal laparoscopic aortic bypass is feasible. In patients with TASC C and D aortoiliac occlusive lesions, short-term outcomes are comparable to those with conventional aortic bypass. After the initial learning curve, laparoscopic technique may reduce the operative trauma of aortic bypass...|$|R
40|$|A piezoworm {{step-and-repeat}} type actuator {{is being}} developed which uses complementary configurations for the two clamping sections. The clamps engage on opposite extremes of the common clamp signal—while one clamp engages with high voltage, the other releases at high voltage and vice versa for low voltage.

A diode-shunted delay circuit that causes <b>unclamping</b> <b>to</b> occur more slowly than clamping can be added in series with each clamp.

40|$|The {{impact of}} hot-carrier {{injection}} (HCI) due <b>to</b> repetitive <b>unclamped</b> inductive switching (UIS) on the electrical performance of low-voltage trench power n-type MOSFETs (nMOSFETs) is assessed. Trench power nMOSFETs with 20 - and 30 -V breakdown voltage ratings in TO- 220 packages have been fabricated {{and subjected to}} over 100 million cycles of repetitive UIS with different avalanche currents IAV at a mounting base temperature TMB of 150 °C. Impact ionization during avalanche conduction in the channel causes hot-hole injection into the gate dielectric, which results in a reduction of the threshold voltage VGSTX, {{as the number of}} avalanche cycles N increases. The experimental data reveal a power-law relationship between the change in the threshold voltage ΔVGSTX and N. The results show that the power-law prefactor is directly proportional to the avalanche current. After 100 million cycles, it was observed in the 20 -V rated MOSFETs that the power-law prefactor increased by 30 % when IAV was increased from 160 to 225 A, thereby approximating a linear relationship. A stable subthreshold slope with avalanche cycling indicates that interface trap generation may not be an active degradation mechanism. The impact of the cell pitch on avalanche ruggedness is also investigated by testing 2. 5 - and 4 - m cell-pitch 30 -V rated MOSFETs. Measurements showed that the power-law prefactor reduced by 40 % when the cell pitch was reduced by 37. 5 %. The improved VGSTX stability with the smaller cell-pitch MOSFETs is attributed to a lower avalanche current per unit cell resulting in less hot-hole injection and, hence, smaller VGSTX shift. The 2. 5 -m cell-pitch MOSFETs also show 25 % improved on -state resistance RDSON, better RDSON stability, and 20 % less subthreshold slope compared with the 4 -m cell-pitch MOSFETs, although with 100 % higher initial IDSS and less IDSS stability with avalanche cycling. These results are important for manufacturers of automotive MOSFETs where multiple avalanche occurrences over the lifetime of the MOSFET are expected...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is {{the third}} most common endogenously {{produced}} gaseous signaling molecule, but its impact on hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, especially on mitochondrial function, remains unclear. In this study, rats were randomized into Sham, I/R, ischemia preconditioning (IPC) or sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H 2 S donor) preconditioning groups. To establish a model of segmental (70 %) warm hepatic ischemia, the hepatic artery, left portal vein and median liver lobes were occluded for 60 min and then <b>unclamped</b> <b>to</b> allow reperfusion. Preconditioning with 12. 5, 25 or 50 μmol/kg NaHS prior to the I/R insult significantly increased serum H 2 S levels, and, similar to IPC, NaHS preconditioning decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the plasma and prevented hepatocytes from undergoing I/R-induced necrosis. Moreover, a sub-toxic dose of NaHS (25 μmol/kg) did not disrupt the systemic hemodynamics but dramatically inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening and thus prevented mitochondrial-related cell death and apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that NaHS preconditioning markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta (p-GSK- 3 β) and B-cell lymphoma- 2 (Bcl- 2) and decreased the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and cleaved caspase- 3 / 9 levels.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the usefulness of dynamic continuous on-line vectorcardiography for monitoring the occurrence of myocardial ischaemia during carotid endarterectomy. Methods. We studied 21 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Patients underwent general anaesthesia with iso¯urane or sevo¯urane. The vectorcardiogram was monitored con-tinuously during carotid endarterectomy. Electrodes were placed according to the previously described lead system and connected to a computerized system for on-line vectorcardio-graphy. Two trend variables were recorded: the QRS vector difference, which re¯ects changes in the shape of the QRS complex; and the ST vector magnitude, which represents de¯ection of the ST segment from the isoelectric level. The ST segment de¯ection was measured 60 ms after termination of the QRS complex. Results. Vectorcardiography was successfully recorded in all 21 patients. Three patients showed intraoperative vectorcardiogram abnormalities. In one of these three patients, both ST vector magnitude and QRS vector difference increased after induction of anaesthesia and ST vector magnitude returned to baseline after administration of nitroglycerin. In the other two patients, both ST vector magnitude and QRS vector difference gradually increased after cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery and ST vector magnitude returned <b>to</b> baseline after <b>unclamping.</b> QRS vector difference remained elevated for several hours in all three patients. Conclusions. Monitoring ST vector magnitude and QRS vector difference by vectorcardio-graphy may be useful for identifying myocardial ischaemia during carotid endarterectomy...|$|R

For both doses, {{the elimination of}} RSU- 1069 followed first-order kinetics in both plasma and unclamped tumours. After 100 mg kg- 1, the peak plasma concentration of RSU- 1069 was 40 micrograms ml- 1; the elimination t 1 / 2 was 39. 3 +/- 11. 1 min. After 20 mg kg- 1, the peak plasma concentration was 3 micrograms ml- 1; the elimination t 1 / 2 was 47. 8 +/- 6. 3 min. In unclamped tumours, the peak concentration was 50 micrograms g- 1 with an elimination t 1 / 2 of 36. 1 +/- 9. 6 min for the 100 mg kg- 1 dose, and 4 micrograms g- 1 with an elimination t 1 / 2 of 41. 9 +/- 6. 1 min for the 20 mg kg- 1 dose. The tumour and plasma elimination half-times {{were not significantly different}} (P greater than 0. 2) for the two doses. Clamping the tumour 30 min after administration of 100 mg kg- 1 of RSU- 1069 decreased the tumour elimination t 1 / 2 to 10. 9 +/- 1. 4 min. After releasing the clamp, RSU- 1069 returned rapidly <b>to</b> the <b>unclamped</b> tumour concentration. The unclamped tumour/plasma ratio reached a maximum of 4 - 6, then decreased to a constant value of about 2 for both doses, indicating that RSU- 1069 accumulates in these 9 L tumours. RSU- 1069 kills hypoxic sc 9 L cells more efficiently than oxic sc 9 L cells; at a surviving fraction of 0. 5, the SER was 4. 8. For in vitro 9 L cells, the SER was approximately 50 when the comparison was between those treated in 2. 1 % 0 (2) and those treated in less than 7. 5 x 10 (- 3) % 0 (2); it was approximately 100 when the comparison was between those treated in 21 % 0 (2) and those treated in less than 7. 5 x 10 (- 3) % 0 (3). Tumours treated with RSU- 1069 and clamped for various times exhibited biphasic cell-kill kinetics; at 50 mg kg- 1, little additional cell kill was achieved after 40 min of clamping. Our data also indicate that RSU- 1069 is 300 - 1000 fold more efficient than misonidazole or SR 2508 for killing hypoxic sc 9 L tumour cells in situ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} {{moclobemide}} on damaged ovarian tissue induced by ischemia-reperfusion and damaged contralateral ovarian tissue were investigated in rats,biochemically and histologically. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 rats were equally divided intofour groups: 10 mg/kg moclobemide, 20 mg/kg moclobemide, ischemia/reperfusion control,and intact control groups. A 2 - 2. 5 -cm-long vertical incision {{was made in}} the lowerabdomen of each rat in order to reach the ovaries, after which a vascular clip was placedon the lower side of the right ovary of each animal in the two treatment groups and theischemia-reperfusion control group, but not in the healthy (intact control) animal group. The purpose of this procedure was to create ischemia over the course of three hours, thenthe clips were <b>unclamped</b> <b>to</b> provide reperfusion for the next two hours. At the end ofthe two hours of reperfusion, all the animals were killed by high-dose anaesthesia andtheir ovaries were taken and subjected to histological and biochemical (malondialdehyde,nitric oxide, glutathione) studies. Results: The obtained results showed that moclobemide suppressed nitric oxide andmalondialdehyde production in the ischemia - reperfusion damage area, and preventedthe decrease in endogenous antioxidant levels (glutathione) in the rat ovariantissue. Moclobemide also prevented infiltration of leukocytes to the ovarian tissue. These results showed that moclobemide protected ovarian tissue against ischemiareperfusioninjury. Conclusion: This study shows that moclobemide represses malondialdehyde and nitricoxide production in the rat ovarian tissue subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury andkeeps the endogenous antioxidant glutathione level from decreasing. Moclobemide alsoinhibits leukocytic migration into ovarian tissue following ischemia-reperfusion injury. From these results, it is suggested that moclobemide can be used in the treatment of ovarianischemia-reperfusion injury...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Acute {{renal failure}} still is, with the {{exception}} of cardiac deaths, the most important pathological process associated with perioperative mortality in patients operated for abdominal aortic aneurysms. The intraoperative change in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular function have been investigated in human and animal models, particularly over the past 15 years. Despite large variation in study populations, measurement techniques and study designs in general, a significant body of evidence has developed which suggests infrarenal aortic clamp-induced renal ischemia to be the cause of postoperative acute renal failure when this complication does occur. It is rather surprizing then that, despite some recent studies which have reported on various pharmacological interventions to prevent intraoperative renal ischemia (with variable success), very little has apparently been done to unravel the pathogenesis and exact pathophysiology of this potentially lethal complication. Although a number of investigators suggest the possibility of hormonal involvement (particularly reninangiotensin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and catecholamines) in the process, the exact role of these mediators have not been explored (or reported) in a structured fashion. In an initial human study, renal hemodynamics and function were measured from the preoperative period, during the intraoperative phase and at least until 4 hours after aortic <b>unclamping.</b> <b>To</b> investigate the possibility of a temporal relationship between renal changes and fluctuations in hormonal concentrations, plasma concentrations of relevant hormones were determined at every sampling period where renal parameters were measured. The decrease in RBF and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which we demonstrated to coincide with infrarenal aortic cross clamping, is consistent with results previously published. We demonstrated persistence of the impairment of these parameters as long as 4 hours into the postoperative phase; which has previously only been reported for the period until immediately after aortic unclamping with the abdomen still open. The persistence of a depressed GFR until the time of discharge of patients is cause for concern, particularly in patients with compromised renal function prior to surgery. Of the measured hormones with a potential influence on RBF and nephron function, renin was the only mediator where changes in plasma concentrations coincided with the depression of RBF and GFR after aortic cross clamping. The design of our study did not allow us to conclude whether the concomitant increase in angiotensin II was primarily responsible for the change in renal hemodynamics, or whether the raised renin (and angiotensin) levels were stimulated by the decrease in RBF induced by another mechanism. In another patient group, we demonstrated that the combination of mannitol and dopamine provided no protection against the deleterious effects of aortic cross clamping. In fact, the high urine volumes produced under the influence of these agents (which did not correlate with RBF at the corresponding periods), is likely to prompt a false sense of security. Given the lack of any objective benefit afforded by these agents, their use in these clinical circumstances should be discouraged. The animal studies were aimed at elucidation of the exact role of angiotensin in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the renal changes associated with infrarenal aortic clamping, as well as the interaction of angiotensin with other modulators for which an interactive relationship had been described previously under other experimental and/or clinical circumstances. The first study showed that, although renin (and thus angiotensin) concentrations were high after aortic unclamping, the hormone had no pathogenic or pathophysiological role of significance in the observed renal changes during this period (since blocking angiotensin II activation by the prevention of renin release, or by inhibiting the conversion enzyme, did not prevent a substantial decrease in RBF or GFR during that period). Preventing angiotensin II activation did, however, prevent renal changes during aortic clamping. This beneficial effect did not establish a primary role for angiotensin during that period, since the favourable influence could also (at least partially) be explained by prevention of the permissive influence of angiotensin on other vasoconstrictors and/or other vasodilatory influences of ACE inhibition and [1 - blockade which are unrelated to angiotensin. This study did indicate that (at least partially) different mechanisms are responsible for the renal changes seen during aortic clamping, and after aortic unclamping. The second study explored the role of calcium in the renal pathophysiological changes during aortic clamping and after unclamping. The protective influence effected by the administration of a Ca 2 + -blocker suggest the dependence of the renal vasoconstrictive and glomerular pathophysiological process(es) on the cellular influx of Ca 2 + through voltage-gated channels. It unfortunately provides no definitive insight into the primary instigators of these processes. However, it does offer a clinically useful method of preventing these changes and protecting the kidney against ischemic injury during abdominal aortic surgery. The third component of the animal studies demonstrates the importance of the protective effect of renal prostaglandins during the specific experimental (and probably also the clinical) circumstances. Again, it does not provide definitive information on the mediators responsible for the renal changes, since the deleterious effects of numerous endogenous substances have previously been shown to be counterbalanced by intrarenal synthesis of prostaglandins under various experimental and clinical circumstances. The extent of the pathophysiological and ultrastructural changes which occurred under the influence of a NSAID does, however, suggest that these drugs should not be used under these clinical circumstances. The last component of the study provides evidence that angiotensin only plays a secondary/supplementary role in the renal pathophysiological process even during aortic clamping. This may explain the contradictory evidence regarding the potential beneficial effect of ACE inhibition (on renal hemodynamics and glomerular function) during abdominal aortic surgery (Licker et al. 1996, Colson et al. 1992 a). Based on our studies, ACE inhibition can not be supported for this purpose. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Akute nierversaking is met die uitsondering van kardiale sterftes, steeds die belangrikste patologiese proses wat geassosieer is met perioperatiewe mortaliteit in pasiënte wat opereer word vir abdominale aorta aneurismes. Die intraoperatiewe veranderinge in renale bloedvloei (NBV) en glomerulêre funksie is die afgelope 15 jaar ondersoek en gerapporteer in pasiënte- sowel as diere-modelle. Ten spyte van groot variasies in studie-populasies, meettegnieke en ontwerp van studies in die algemeen, dui 'n wesenlike hoeveelheid getuienis daarop dat infrarenale klemming van die aorta renale isgemie induseer, wat die oorsaak is van postoperatiewe akute nierversaking wanneer hierdie komplikasie voorkom. Dit is verbasend dat, ten spyte van sommige onlangse studies wat rapporteer oor 'n verskeidenheid farmakologiese ingrepe om intraoperatiewe renale isgemie te voorkom (met wisselende sukses), baie min oënskynlik gedoen is om die patogenese en die presiese patofisiologie van hierdie potensieel dodelike komplikasie te ontrafel. Hoewel verskeie outeurs die moontlikheid van hormonale betrokkenheid (veral renienangiotensien, antidiuretiese hormoon en katekolamiene) in hierdie proses suggereer, is die presiese rol van hierdie mediators nog nie op 'n gestruktureerde wyse ondersoek (of rapporteer) nie. In ons aanvanklike pasiënte-studie is renale hemodinamika en -funksie gemeet vanaf die preoperatiewe periode, gedurende die intra-operatiewe fase en tot minstens vier uur na ontklemming van die aorta. Serumkonsentrasies van relevante hormone is bepaal tydens elke metingsperiode waar renale parameters gemeet is, ten einde die moontlikheid van 'n temporale verwantskap tussen renale veranderinge en variasies in hormoonkonsentrasies te ondersoek. Die vermindering in NBV en glomerulêre filtrasiespoed (GFS) wat ons aangetoon het om saam te val met infrarenale aortaklemming, stem ooreen met resultate wat tevore deur ander navorsers publiseer is. Ons het aangetoon dat die inkorting van hierdie parameters voortduur tot minstens vier uur na aorta-ontklemming. Hierdie veranderinge is tevore slegs rapporteer vir periodes tot kort na aorta-ontklemming voor sluiting van die buikwond. Die feit dat die GFS steeds verlaag is met ontslag van hierdie pasiënte, skep rede tot kommer, veral in pasiënte wat alreeds ingekorte nierfunksie het voor die chirurgiese prosedure. Van die gemete hormone wat moontlik 'n invloed sou kon uitoefen op NBV eh nefronfunksie, was renien die enigste waarvan verandering in plasmakonsentrasies saamgeval het met die onderdrukking van NBV en GFS na aortaklemming. Die ontwerp van ons studie het ons nie toegelaat om 'n besliste uitspraak te maak of die geassosieerde verhoging in angiotensien II primêr verantwoordelik was vir die verandering in renale hemodinamika, of dat die verhoogde renien (en angiotensien) bloedvlakke moontlik sekondêr stimuleer is deur die verandering in NBV wat deur 'n ander meganisme induseer is. In 'n ander pasiëntegroep het ons aangetoon dat die kombinasie van mannitol en dopamien geen beskerming verleen het teen die nadelige effekte van aorta-klemming nie. Die groot volumes uriene wat uitgeskei is onder die invloed van hierdie middels (wat nie korreleer het met NBV tydens ooreenstemmende periodes nie), het inderwaarheid 'n ontoepaslike gerustheid uitgelok. Weens die ooglopende gebrek aan objektiewe voordeel wat verleen word deur hierdie middels, behoort hulle gebruik tydens hierdie kliniese omstandighede ontmoedig te word. Die doel van die diere studies was die identifisering van die presiese rol van angiotensien in die patogenese en patofisiologie van die renale veranderinge geassosieer met infrarenale aortaklemming, sowel as die interaksie van angiotensien met ander modulators waarvoor 'n interaktiewe verwantskap voorheen beskryf is onder eksperimentele en/of kliniese omstandighede. Die eerste studie het getoon dat alhoewel renien (en dus angiotensien) konsentrasies hoog was na aorta-ontklemming, die hormone geen betekenisvolle patogenetiese of patofisiologiese rol in die waargenome renale veranderinge gedurende hierdie periode het nie (aangesien blokkade van angiotensien aktivering deur voorkoming van renien vrystelling, of deur inhibisie van angiotensien omsettingsensiem (AOE), nie 'n daling in NBV of GFS kon voorkom nie). Voorkoming van angiotensien II aktivering het egter wel renale verandering voorkom gedurende aortaklemming. Dié voordelige effek het nie 'n primêre rol vir angiotensien gedurende die periode bevestig nie, aangesien die gunstige invloed ook (ten minste gedeeltelik) verduidelik kon word deur die voorkoming van die fassiliterende invloed van angiotensien op ander vasokonstriktore en/of ander vasodilator-invloede van die onderdrukking van AOE en ïs-blokkers (wat geen verband het met angiotensien of die blokkade daarvan nie). Die studie het aangetoon dat (ten minste gedeeltelik) verskillende meganismes verantwoordelik is vir renale veranderinge wat gesien is gedurende aortaklemming en na -ontklemming. Die tweede studie het die rol van kalsium in die renale patofisiologiese veranderinge gedurende aortaklemming en na ontklemming ondersoek. Die beskermende invloed wat deur die toediening van Ca 2 + -blokkers bewerkstellig is, het bevestig dat die renale vasokonstriktoriese en glomerulêre patofisiologiese prosesse afhanklik is van sellulêre influks van kalsium deur spannings-afhanklike kannale. Dit het ongelukkig geen definitiewe insig verleen ten opsigte van die primêre inisieerders van die proses nie. Dit verskaf nogtans 'n bruikbare kliniese metode om daardie veranderinge te voorkom en die niere teen isgemiese besering gedurende abdominale aorta-chirurgie te beskerm. Die derde komponent van die diere-studies demonstreer die belangrikheid van die beskermende effek van renale prostaglandiene tydens die spesifieke eksperimentele (en waarskynlik ook die kliniese) omstandighede. Weereens gee dit nie definitiewe inligting oor die bemiddelaars wat verantwoordelik is vir die renale veranderinge nie, aangesien die skadelike effekte van verskeie endogene stowwe voorheen aangetoon is om beperk of voorkom te word deur die intrarenale vrystelling van prostaglandiene. Die omvang van die patofisiologiese en ultrastrukturele veranderinge wat ontstaan het onder die invloed van nie-steroïed anti-inflammatoriese middels (wat gebruik is om prostaglandien sintese te inhibeer), dui aan dat hierdie middels vermy moet word onder soortelyke kliniese omstandighede. Die laaste komponent van die studie verskaf 'n sterk aanduiding dat angiotensien slegs 'n sekondêre/aanvullende rol speel in die renale patofisiologiese proses, selfs gedurende aortaklemming. Dit mag die weersprekende getuienis oor die potensiële voordeel van AOE onderdrukking (op renale hemodinamika en glomerulêre funksie) gedurende abdominale aortachirurgie (Licker et al. 1996, Colson et al. 1992 a) verklaar. Gebaseer op ons studies, kan AOE onderdrukking nie ondersteun word vir hierdie doel nie...|$|R
