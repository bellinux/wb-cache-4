25|$|Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) uses {{a series}} of kavanot, {{directions}} of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> prayer, which is no less than affecting {{the very fabric of}} reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{known as}} his chief work, the Mythologies (Latin: Mitologiarum libri III) {{is a series}} of legends told in three books. Each book is {{introduced}} by its own prologue. There are a total of fifty chapters: each chapter explains a classical myth and interprets that myth using allegory. These interpretations include etymologies of the names of certain characters, as well as conclusions as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the story in terms of morality. In the prologue, Fulgentius claims that his purpose was to strip the classic Greek myths of all their fictitious and meaningless details in order to reveal the obscure truths they contain. He also suggests a Christian motive, though it would be inaccurate to define the Mythologies or any of Fulgentius' allegorical works as 'Christian allegories'.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{centre of}} Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: {{the town is}} austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just {{a few inches from}} the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and a foot or so above the actual street level. This type of door is called a porta dei morti (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. This is almost certainly false, but there is no agreement as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the secondary doors. A more likely theory is that the door was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} must be well-suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> beaching whales. It {{is against}} the law to kill pilot whales at locations with inappropriate conditions. The seabed must gradually slope from the shore out to deep water. Given such conditions, the chances are good that the whales can be driven fully ashore or close enough to the shore that they can be killed from land. When a school of pilot whales is sighted, boats gather behind them and slowly drive them towards the chosen authorized location, usually a bay or the end of a fjord. There are 23 towns, villages or bays (Viðvík is not populated) that have the right conditions, and therefore legal authorization, for beaching whales. These are in alphabetical order: Bøur, Fámjin, Fuglafjørður, Húsavík, Hvalba (and Nes-Hvalba), Hvalvík, Hvannasund, Klaksvík, Leynar, Miðvágur, Norðragøta, Norðskáli, Sandur, Syðrugøta, Tjørnuvík, Tórshavn (in Sandagerð), Tvøroyri, Vágur, Vestmanna, Viðvík (near Hvannasund, but on the east coast of Viðoy) and Øravík.|$|E
25|$|In much of macroecology, {{the use of}} EOO as {{a measure}} of range size may be {{appropriate}}; however, AOO is a more appropriate measure when evaluating O–A relationships. In macroecological investigations that are primarily biogeographical in nature, the variables of interest can be expected to vary most from one extent of occurrence to the opposite, and less so through discontinuities contained within the total EOO. However, when investigating O-A relationships, the area occupied by a species is the variable of interest, and the inclusion of discontinuities within the EOO could significantly influence results. In the extreme case where occupied habitats are distributed at random throughout the EOO, a relationship between abundance and range size (EOO) would not be expected. Because O–A relationships have strong conservation implications, Gaston and Fuller have argued that clear distinctions need to be made as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the EOO and AOO as measures of range size, and that in association with O-A relationships the AOO is the more useful measure of species abundance.|$|E

25|$|John Calvin was {{a student}} of law and then {{classics}} at the University of Paris. Around 1533 he became involved in religious controversies and converted to Protestantism, a new Christian reform movement which was persecuted by the Catholic Church in France, forcing him to go into hiding. He moved to Basel, Switzerland, for safety in 1535, and around this time he must have begun writing a summary of theology which would become the Institutes. His Catholic opponents sought to associate him and his associates (known as Huguenots in France) with radical Anabaptists, {{some of whom had}} been defeated after a long siege in the Münster Rebellion in June 1535. He decided to adapt the work he had been writing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> defending Protestants suffering from persecution from false accusations that they were espousing radical and heretical doctrines. The work, written in Latin, was published in Basel in March 1536 with a preface addressed to King Francis I of France, entreating him to give the Protestants a hearing rather than continue to persecute them. It is six chapters long, covering the basics of Christian faith using the familiar catechetical structure of the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the sacraments, as well as a chapter on Christian liberty and political theology. Soon after publishing it, Calvin began his ministry in Geneva, Switzerland.|$|E

500|$|Arguing for respondents, Thomas Goldstein {{distinguished}} between political neutrality and political apathy.

Justice Elena Kagan questioned Goldstein as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the First Amendment saying, [...] "the idea has to do with why the government acted" [...] to which he responded, [...] "It's called an individual right, not a government wrong."
