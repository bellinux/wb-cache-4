25|$|Dublin {{has been}} the focus of major {{projects}} such as the East-Link and West-Link <b>toll-bridges,</b> as well as the Dublin Port Tunnel. The Jack Lynch Tunnel, under the River Lee in Cork, and the Limerick Tunnel, under the River Shannon, were two major projects outside Dublin. Several by-pass projects are underway in other urban areas.|$|R
5000|$|In 1852 the Trustees' {{powers were}} renewed by Act of Parliament which also allowed for {{additional}} tolls for vehicles [...] "drawn by steam or machinery". Twenty years later, in 1872, a {{law was passed}} allowing the trustees and owners of turnpikes and <b>toll-bridges</b> to surrender their rights to the local highway authority. Bridge traffic had been declining since {{the opening of the}} Reading to Oxford Railway in 1844 so the Trustees immediately made arrangements to pass the bridge to the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. From midnight on 1 November 1874 tolls were permanently lifted.|$|R

6000|$|That is the shopgirl smile, and I enjoin you to shun {{it unless}} you are well {{fortified}} with callosity of the heart, caramels and a congeniality for the capers of Cupid. This smile belonged to Masie's recreation hours {{and not to the}} store; but the floorwalker must have his own. He is the Shylock of the stores. When he comes nosing around {{the bridge of his nose}} is a <b>toll-bridge.</b> It is goo-goo eyes or [...] "git" [...] when he looks toward a pretty girl. Of course not all floorwalkers are thus. Only a few days ago the papers printed news of one over eighty years of age.|$|E
60|$|At a short {{distance}} below the <b>toll-bridge</b> there was a railroad-bridge, which you cannot see in the picture. This bridge was not intended for anything but railroad trains; it was very high above the water, it was very long, {{and it was not}} floored. When any one stood on the cross-ties which supported the rails, he could look right down into the water far below him. For the convenience of the railroad-men and others who sometimes were obliged to go on the bridge, there was a single line of boards placed over the ties at one side of the track, and there was a slight hand-rail put up at that side of the bridge.|$|E
50|$|The Republic's {{major road}} network {{is focused on}} Dublin. Motorways were {{extended}} from Dublin to other major cities {{as part of the}} Transport 21 programme which aimed to have a world-class motorway network in place by the end of 2010. At that time, Ireland's main cities (Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Belfast) excluding Derry were connected to Dublin with motorways or with near-motorway standard roads. Dublin was the focus of some other major projects, such as the East-Link and West-Link <b>toll-bridges,</b> as well as the Dublin Port Tunnel. Major by-pass projects were also built around other cities and towns. The Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee in Cork was a major project outside Dublin, and a fourth crossing at Limerick under the River Shannon (known as the Limerick Tunnel) opened in 2010.|$|R
60|$|When I was {{a youngster}} {{and lived in}} the country, {{there were three of}} us boys who used to go very {{frequently}} to a small village about a mile from our homes. To reach this village it was necessary to cross a narrow river, and there was a <b>toll-bridge</b> for that purpose. The toll for every foot-passenger who went over this bridge was one cent. Now, this does not seem like a very high charge, but, at that time, we very often thought that we would much rather keep our pennies to spend in the village than to pay them to the old man who took toll on the bridge. But it was often necessary for us to cross the river, and to do so, and save our money at the same time, we used to adopt a very hazardous expedient.|$|E

50|$|Work on the {{replacement}} bridge began on 30 November 1866. The old bridge was demolished on 6 May 1867 and the approaches rerouted {{ready for the}} new bridge opening on 1 July 1867. The bridge continued to be owned by the Cookham Bridge Company and operated as a <b>toll-bridge</b> until 1947 when it was bought out by Berkshire County Council for £30,000 (£) and the tolls abolished.|$|E
50|$|During the Fraser Gold Rush {{the site}} was the {{location}} of a boomtown known as Bridge River. That name came from the <b>toll-bridge</b> built over the river at this point in 1859 to replace a native-built pole bridge. The town only lasted a few years, as an easier crossing to the Old Cariboo Road was Miller's Ferry, closer to today's Lillooet, at the site of a 1913-built suspension bridge.|$|E
50|$|He was {{a founder}} of Henderson County when it was formed from Nacogdoches County in 1846. Brown served as a notary public and a ferry operator, and {{received}} a license to operate a <b>toll-bridge</b> over Kickapoo Creek near Old Normandy (present-day Brownsboro, which was named for John Brown). On 27 April 1846, Brown helped to found the Texas Democratic Party in Austin. Brown served as a commissioner to help locate the state penitentiary in 1848. In 1850, Brown {{was one of the}} commissioners that selected Athens as the seat of Henderson County.|$|E
50|$|George C. Gregory led the {{successful}} {{effort to build}} the privately funded Westham Bridge, a <b>toll-bridge,</b> which was completed in 1911. Linking western Henrico and Chesterfield counties, the bridge was located between Bosher's Dam and Williams Island Dam {{just west of the}} 7 miles of rapids and falls which constitute the fall line of the James River at Richmond. The Westham Bridge was located just west of the Huguenot Bridge, which was built in 1949 and replaced it. Piers, abutments at each side, and power lines still marked the path in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|John Dunn Bridge {{is located}} in Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico in north central New Mexico. It crosses the Rio Grande near the {{confluence}} of the Rio Hondo. It was built in 1908 by John Dunn who transported travelers and mail into Taos and housed travelers overnight at his hotel near the bridge. It was sold to the Territory of New Mexico in 1912 and at that time the <b>toll-bridge</b> was made a free bridge to travelers. Recreational opportunities on the rivers include fishing, kayaking, and whitewater rafting. It is near the Black Rock Hot Springs.|$|E
5000|$|Plans for {{a bridge}} to connect the North Carolina {{mainland}} with Roanoke Island started in the 1920s, when local developers wanting to make the Outer Banks a tourist destination. However, {{because of the high}} cost, the State Highway Commission focused their funds on improving the primary highway system. As a result, the local businessmen took {{matters into their own hands}} and formed private <b>toll-bridge</b> companies; building Roanoke Sound Bridge in 1928 and the Wright Memorial Bridge in 1930. [...] By around 1940, free ferry service was available between Manns Harbor and Manteo.|$|E

50|$|Growth in Winona {{was built}} on a railway and {{steamboat}} transportation system, wheat milling, and lumber. In 1856 over 1,300 steamboats stopped at Winona. The railway system grew and the Winona Railway Bridge, built of steel and iron with a steam-powered swingspan over the river, was the second railway bridge to span the Mississippi. The first train crossed on July 4, 1891 and the bridge served the Green Bay & Western (GBW) and Burlington Route for the next 94 years until it was closed in 1985 and dismantled {{in the fall of}} 1990. In 1892, a wagon <b>toll-bridge</b> over the Mississippi, a steel high-bridge, was completed and remained in service until 1942.|$|E

50|$|In 1632, the {{entrepreneur}} Pierre Pidou directed {{the construction of}} a wooden <b>toll-bridge</b> which would be called Pont Sainte-Anne (in deference to Anne of Austria) or Pont Rouge (due to its color). It was designed to replace the Tuileries ferry upon which the rue du Bac (bac meaning ferry in French) owes its name. The ferry had been offering crossings since 1550. Fragile, this bridge of fifteen arches would be repaired {{for the first time in}} 1649, completely redone two years later, burnt in 1654, flooded in 1656, completely rebuilt in 1660, propped up in 1673 and finally carried away by a flood in February 1684. Madame de Sévigné reported that this last incident caused the loss of eight of the bridge's arches.|$|E
50|$|Sussex County has two <b>toll-bridge</b> {{crossings}} {{over the}} Delaware River. Operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, the Milford-Montague Toll Bridge (also {{known as the}} US 206 Toll Bridge) carries U.S. Route 206 over the Delaware connecting Montague Township and Milford, Pennsylvania. The current bridge was opened in 1954, replacing a series of bridges located here beginning in 1826. Route 206 merges with U.S. Route 209 a mile south of the village center. Tolls are collected only from motorists traveling westbound, into Pennsylvania. The Dingman's Ferry Bridge is the last privately owned toll bridge on the Delaware River {{and one of the}} last few in the United States. It is owned and operated by the Dingmans Choice and Delaware Bridge Company which has operated bridges here since 1836. The bridge connects the village of Dingmans in Delaware Township in Pike County, Pennsylvania and State Route 2019 with County Route 560 and the Old Mine Road in Sandyston Township, New Jersey.|$|E
5000|$|From Paris, {{she went}} to Chicago. She took a studio, and {{exhibited}} at the Chicago Art Institute: Holland spinners, French boulevards, an occasional portrait, notable for tone and balance. These the critics praised and the public knew not of. Inevitably she experimented in many means of expression: etchings, monotypes, pastels. One of these went into Hamilton McCormick's collection. Twelve small designs were included in a calendar zinc-etched in colors. The pictures were about the size, shape, and style of tiles. Five-inch squares with romantic subjects heavily outlined and colored in flat washes. They {{had nothing to do}} with the seasons and the holidays beyond a certain feeling for the appropriate. Thus March was a knight-errant riding a white charger over bare brown hills; April was a green-mantled Elizabethan dame beating her way against a shower in a narrow street of half-timbered houses; July showed two lovers floating in a gondola past the marble steps of an Italian garden, the swain singing rapturously to his lute. And so on. No special Christmas or Valentine's Day or Fourth of July business. Perhaps the absence of these timeworn themes was welcome. Perhaps the public really recognized a fresh and individual touch. Anyhow that calendar had [...] "an immense little success." [...] From a few leaflets sent across the ocean to la bonne Henriette in her cremerie certain rising French artists even wrote to America for more. Max Liebermann, the leader of the German Secession, praised them. Actually they were the turning-point for their creator from pictorial to decorative art.On them followed other calendars, other title - pages, other covers, and posters. One advertising a piano course was a charcoal drawing of a demurely attentive boy and girl. Another for a linen sale set forth, in an admirable combination of a few colors, a mother in a white morning robe buttoning her little girl's starched frock beside an open bureau drawer wherein piles of embroidered garments could be seen. The two dainty figures were in themselves winning, but gathered artistic force from the child's carroty tresses against the pink-striped wall-paper, the flowered tester and hangings, the rich red brown of the old mahogany furniture. As usual in Ostertag's pictures, the furniture was of correct design. Another calendar that took like wildfire displayed in a harmony of greens and chromes a small Velasquez-like princess with spreading hoop and parrot on fist. Still another shows a pale boy dreaming by the side of a lily-covered pond while his mother reads a book; on one of the lily-pads a palpable fairyland creature has appeared, a fat frog wearing a golden crown. This is a symphony in sunny green and lemon yellow, with touches of faint lilac in the flowers and the mother's gown. The backgrounds were always architecturally sound. [...] "Yankee Doodle" [...] rides his pony through the quaintest of step-gabled streets and across a <b>toll-bridge</b> of the real old type. The pretty maid waits for Johnny to come home from the fair" [...] in front of a genuine Colonial mansion, buff and white, with a fan-light over its columned portico.Such chronological details were noted only as proving conscientious research even in childish matters. For the most part, the artist chose the early Victorian fashions—men in peg-top plaid trousers; women in crinolines, angel sleeves, lockets, and hair-nets; little girls in pig-tails and pantalettes. Here were delectable and varied decorations breathing a sort of innocent drollery, what M. de Monvel called [...] "a precious quality of naivete". Her illustrations for Max Müller's [...] "Memories," [...] were stamped with unusual breadth and proportion.|$|E
