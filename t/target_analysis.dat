5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA <b>target.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|E

40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{method is}} introduced to detect selected pharmaceutical residues and polar pesticides with UHPLC–MS in water samples of different origin. Active or passive water sampling was {{combined with a}} laboratory solid-phase extraction cleanup and stable isotope dilution analysis. Recovery experiments demonstrated that the internal standard correction performed well for the compensation of matrix effects. Besides, the original <b>targeted</b> <b>analysis</b> approach was expanded by non-target analysis of the samples with only one more consecutive injection run needed. The key benefits of this multi-residue <b>analysis</b> are:• <b>Targeted</b> <b>analysis</b> and quantification combined with non-target analysis on a micro-scale UHPLC–MS system usually employed for qualitative analysis only. • The internal standards for <b>targeted</b> <b>analysis</b> were used in non-target runs to calculate the partition coefficient log P of unknown substances employing the retention time index (RTI). • The filtering of database hits for two criteria (exact mass and partition coefficient) significantly reduced the list of suspects {{and at the same}} time rendered it possible to perform non-target analysis with lower mass accuracy (no lock-spray) in the range of 20 – 500  ppm...|$|R

All four use speech presentations in connection with their work. Through <b>target</b> group <b>analysis</b> and observation, qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires are we able to identify our target group’s needs in speech communication. The <b>target</b> group <b>analysis</b> {{has made it possible}} for us to get a clear insight in their oral presentations and their strengths and weaknesses in their presentations. We focused on various rhetorical elements in our empirical study. However, we chose only to focus on the most central rhetorical elements such as body language, nervousness, speaking loudly and clearly and structuring presentations and time. Our target group was in general competent speakers, but they could advantageously improve their body language and speak more clearly and loudly...|$|R
50|$|<b>Targeted</b> <b>analysis</b> {{allows the}} {{thorough}} analysis of all ions, at all abundance range above the noise level, {{at any time}} window in the experiment. In contrast, non-targeted analysis would, typically, only allow detection of the most abundant 50-100 ions over the entire experiment time.

40|$|Most {{analytical}} methods in metabolomics {{are based on}} one of two strategies. The first strategy is aimed at specifically analysing {{a limited number of}} known metabolites or compound classes. Alternatively, an unbiased approach can be used for profiling as many features as possible in a given metabolome without prior knowledge of the identity of these features. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry with instruments capable of measuring m/z ratios with sufficiently low mass measurement uncertainties and simultaneous high scan speeds, it is possible to combine these two strategies, allowing unbiased profiling of biological samples and <b>targeted</b> <b>analysis</b> of specific compounds at the same time without compromises. Such high mass accuracy and mass resolving power reduces the number of candidate metabolites occupying the same retention time and m/z ratio space to a minimum. In this study, we demonstrate how <b>targeted</b> <b>analysis</b> of phospholipids as well as unbiased profiling is achievable using a benchtop orbitrap instrument after high-speed reversed-phase chromatography. The ability to apply both strategies in one experiment is an important step forward in comprehensive analysis of the metabolome. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
