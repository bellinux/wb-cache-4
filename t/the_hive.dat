5|$|Underneath Raccoon City {{exists a}} genetic {{research}} facility called <b>the</b> <b>Hive,</b> {{owned by the}} Umbrella Corporation. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> with it. In response, the facility's artificial intelligence, the Red Queen, seals <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> and kills everyone inside.|$|E
5|$|Neonicotinoids may {{interfere}} with bees' natural homing abilities, causing them to become disoriented and preventing them from finding {{their way back to}} <b>the</b> <b>hive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Presence of {{the queen}} bee: If the queen is not present, <b>the</b> <b>hive</b> died because it was queenless, which is not {{considered}} CCD.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>hive's</b> {{management}} differs strongly {{from the}} tub shaped Greek hive, early publications about <b>the</b> Kenyan <b>hive</b> often mention <b>the</b> Greek <b>hive</b> as {{an inspiration for}} <b>the</b> Kenyan <b>hive.</b>|$|R
30|$|Note {{that the}} {{mortality}} measurements {{did not include}} bees dying away from <b>the</b> <b>hives.</b> <b>The</b> proportion of bees that died at <b>the</b> <b>hives</b> (rather than away from <b>the</b> <b>hives)</b> may itself {{have been affected by}} the experimental treatment, making interpretation of effects of treatment on the indices of observed mortality difficult (see “Conclusions” section).|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} the {{promotion}} of Veni Vidi Vicious and Your New Favourite Band that <b>the</b> <b>Hives</b> signed a record deal with Universal Music, reportedly worth $50 million. This led to a dispute between <b>the</b> <b>Hives</b> and Burning Heart, who claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Hives</b> were still contracted to them for one more album.|$|R
5|$|The student-published {{yearbook}} is the Mimosan, and the student-run {{radio station}} is WRHS <b>The</b> <b>Hive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Honeyguides {{are among}} the few birds that feed on wax. They are named for the greater honeyguide which leads {{traditional}} honey-hunters to bees' nests and, after the hunters have harvested the honey, feeds on the remaining contents of <b>the</b> <b>hive.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{fipronil}} {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, {{in a study by}} the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate <b>the</b> <b>hive,</b> resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to <b>the</b> <b>hive</b> spreads the pesticide among the brood.|$|E
5000|$|... "Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones" [...] is {{the second}} single from <b>the</b> album Tyrannosaurus <b>Hives</b> by <b>The</b> <b>Hives.</b> Released as an Enhanced CD with B-side tracks in 2005, [...] "Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones" [...] was {{considered}} a hit for <b>The</b> <b>Hives,</b> and appeared on several compilations.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> {{conventional}} Langstroth <b>hives,</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance is}} not part of <b>the</b> <b>hive's</b> ventilation system. This allows a great deal of flexibility in both placement and configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Tarred and Feathered is an EP ({{released}} as 7" [...] Vinyl Single or Download) from Swedish band <b>The</b> <b>Hives,</b> {{released in}} 2010 on the No Fun AB label. It {{consists of three}} cover songs from bands that have influenced <b>The</b> <b>Hives.</b>|$|R
5|$|Matt {{looks for}} {{information}} about his sister Lisa and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one hour before <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.|$|E
5|$|In early 2017, Shrewsbury BID, <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> and GRAIN Photography Hub {{organised}} {{an outdoor}} Magnum Photos exhibition. Inspired by Shrewsbury's links to Charles Darwin, this exhibition showcased {{the theme of}} evolution {{through the eyes of}} international photographers. The 10-week exhibition was free to the public and staged at St Mary's Churchyard and the Square.|$|E
5|$|Milla Jovovich as Alice, an-ex Umbrella {{security}} officer turned rogue fighter, {{who has been}} captured by Umbrella scientist after escaping <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> with others. Since the incident, she has experimented upon and bonded with the T-virus on cellular level, granted her with superhuman ability. She also swears vengeance against Umbrella, and became the humanity's last hope for survival of human race.|$|E

50|$|Antihistamines are not {{effective}} in treating <b>the</b> <b>hives</b> in this condition. It may respond to immunosuppressant {{drugs such as}} corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, interferon alpha, interleukin 1 receptor antagonists (Anakinra), perfloxacin, colchicine, cyclosporine or thalidomide. <b>The</b> <b>hives</b> may respond to treatment with PUVA, and the bone pain may respond to bisphosphonates.|$|R
5|$|Milla Jovovich as Alice; former Umbrella Corporation {{security}} officer turned rogue fighter, {{who has been}} captured by Umbrella scientist after escaping <b>The</b> <b>Hive</b> and being experimented upon. Since the T-Virus outbreak at Raccoon City which has spread across the entire world, Alice has bonded with the virus on cellular level, given her with powerful superhuman abilities, making her virtually indestructible.|$|E
5|$|Privates Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Drake are smartgunners on the Sulaco. One {{of the few}} {{survivors}} of the assault on <b>the</b> <b>hive,</b> she helps seal off the complex from the Aliens. Vasquez is immobilized when acid blood from an Alien, shot at point-blank range, lands on her leg. When Gorman returns to help her, they are surrounded; she delivers a fond parting quip, and they detonate a grenade.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to <b>the</b> <b>hive,</b> and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5000|$|What the {{scientists}} eventually conclude is {{that somehow the}} wires that Ormond attached to his hives were acting as antennae, turning <b>the</b> <b>hives</b> into natural radios and piping in the local classical music radio station to <b>the</b> <b>hives.</b> <b>The</b> bees loved it. (KSCO AM 1080, if you're curious, {{it is now a}} right-wing talk radio station. I wonder what effect Rush Limbaugh would have on honey production.) ...|$|R

5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting {{a cause of}} action resulting in failure to return to <b>the</b> <b>hive.</b> In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers {{to the way in which}} it exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at <b>the</b> <b>hive</b> to collect honeycomb. He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from <b>the</b> <b>hive</b> to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to <b>the</b> <b>hive</b> and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E

5|$|The Predator {{travels through}} {{rural and urban}} areas of Gunnison, {{fighting}} more Aliens along the way, and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians. Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by the Predator to bring <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while the Predator successfully leaves Earth.|$|E
5|$|When {{returning}} to the Red Queen's chamber, Kaplan {{points out that the}} four bodies of the group's dead crew from the Glass Hallway Trap sequence are gone. This is a reference to the games, where the bodies of enemies disappear. When the survivors make their escape from <b>the</b> <b>Hive</b> with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the Resident Evil game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.|$|E
5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in <b>the</b> <b>hive,</b> thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
