5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
25|$|Apparently <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{critical}} {{reception of}} this novel, {{and the critical}} outcry when {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the next six years before his death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, I've got {{two of them}} if {{you come}} to that," [...] he answered, <b>taken</b> rather <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brusque and {{apparently}} irrelevant nature of the question.|$|R

25|$|The {{attitude}} of Soviet soldiers was ambiguous. Many committed atrocities, most notably rape and murder, {{and did not}} always distinguish between Poles and Germans, mistreating them equally. Other Soviets, were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brutal treatment of the German civilians and tried to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Many {{fans of the}} {{original}} Squad Leader game who had looked forward to improvements to the system {{with the release of}} Advanced Squad Leader were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> need to replace the four modules they had bought; only the mapboards of the earlier series were compatible with the new game.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, CHS {{became the}} first {{alternative}} school in Michigan to receive accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation officials, according to news reports, were mildly <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> school's eccentricities, questioning {{the lack of any}} non-smoking area within the school and some students' practice of bringing their pets to school.|$|E
50|$|Despite Brienne's {{failure to}} secure House Tully's support, the Stark loyalists are {{successful}} in ousting House Bolton, albeit only with {{the intervention of the}} Knights of the Vale and Littlefinger. Bran and Arya Stark, having heard of the Starks' victory, return to Winterfell. Arya spars with Brienne, and <b>takes</b> Brienne <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ease with which she defeats the older woman.|$|R
60|$|At Auchtermuchty and Portsmouth no obstacle, apparently, {{was offered}} to the invaders. At Brighton the enemy were {{permitted}} to land unharmed. Scarborough, <b>taken</b> utterly <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> boyish vigour of the Young Turks, was an easy prey; and at Yarmouth, though the Grand Duke received a nasty {{slap in the face}} from a dexterously-thrown bloater, the resistance appears to have been equally futile.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} answer--I tell you, sir, I could not answer, so <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> was I <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{assurance}} of the woman. And so, seeming by my silence {{to agree to}} all that she had said, I was dragged away <b>by</b> <b>the</b> butler and the constable into the cellar, in which they locked me for the night.|$|R
25|$|Captain Lee, {{who was in}} {{his private}} cabin {{at the time of}} the incident, {{immediately}} rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, the chief engineer stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it was on his own volition or following an order from Captain Lee. At 8:50, the chief engineer ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06a.m.|$|E
25|$|Some {{relatives}} of the victims in the case were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> announcement of a Crown appeal, especially because Attorney-General Wally Oppal had said {{a few days earlier}} that the prosecution would likely not appeal. Although Pickton had been acquitted on the first-degree murder charges, he was convicted of second-degree murder and received the same sentence as he would have on first-degree murder convictions. The {{relatives of}} the victims expressed concern that the convictions would be jeopardized if the Crown argued that the trial judge had made errors. Opposition critic Leonard Krog criticized the Attorney-General for not having briefed the victims’ families in advance.|$|E
25|$|To bring Fanny to her senses, Sir Thomas {{sends her}} for a visit to her parents in Portsmouth, hoping that the {{contrast}} will awaken her {{to the value of}} Henry's offer. She sets off with William and sees him in his first berth as a commissioned officer. At Portsmouth, she develops a firm bond with her younger sister, Susan, but is <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contrast between her dissolute surroundings — noise, chaos, unpalatable food, crude conversation, and filth everywhere — and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits her there. Although Fanny still refuses him, her attitude begins to soften, particularly as Edmund and Mary seem to be moving toward an engagement.|$|E

[...] "But {{you well}} know, in your naughty little heart, that I have {{burnished}} the old gold of Midas all over anew, and have made it shine as it never shone before. And then that figure of Marygold! Do you perceive no nice workmanship in that? And how finely I have brought out and deepened the moral! What say you, Sweet Fern, Dandelion, Clover, Periwinkle? Would any of you, after hearing this story, be so foolish as to desire the faculty of changing things to gold?" ...|$|R
60|$|Stunned {{and terrified}} though poor Mrs Foster was, as she rushed {{about the room}} in search of water and scent-bottles, she was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> {{somewhat}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> warmth of these expressions, which Bax, in {{the strength of his}} feelings, and the excitement of the moment, uttered quite unconsciously. Guy was utterly confounded, for the truth {{now for the first time}} flashed upon him, and when he beheld his friend tenderly press his lips on the fair forehead of the still insensible Amy, it became clear beyond a doubt. Lucy was also amazed, for although she was aware of Amy's love for Bax, she had never dreamed that it was returned.|$|R
25|$|Doehring, who had {{discounted}} {{the growing}} discontent and longing for peace during the war, was <b>taken</b> completely <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people's revolutionary riots of 1918. In his {{condemnation of the}} January strikes, Doehring spoke of betrayal {{and may have been}} the first to evoke the stab-in-the-back legend, which held that Germany lost the First World War not for military reasons but due to unpatriotic elements at home. Doehring blamed the subsequent defeat in the war and the following November Revolution and claimed that these events were caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decline in Germany's Christian faith and values. For him, most of the blame lay with the Catholic Church and the socialist labor movement. He envisioned a reformation along the lines of Luther's as a solution for Germany.|$|R
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Stax {{was located}} in Memphis, Tennessee, which was still a {{segregated}} city, where Martin Luther King, Jr., {{a leader of the}} civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1968. Whilst there was much racism around the artists, the Stax recording studio seemed to be an escape from the turmoil of the real world. When the artists got into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social consciousness that became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement. On their 1967 tour in Europe, some of the Stax artists were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> welcome that they received, enjoying a better reception in parts of Europe than in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> severity of the condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His {{central role in the}} organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
5000|$|In the Classic Albums {{documentary}} about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> at first <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being [...] "so vindictive that he May felt bad singing it". After the song came together, {{it was agreed that}} the [...] "author should have his way", and the song was recorded as written.|$|R
50|$|His new {{lifestyle}} impacts {{his life}} both {{for better and}} worse, particularly with {{his relationship with his}} supportive girlfriend, Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston), when she decides not to continue with him throughout the remainder of the tour as a rock star girlfriend, though Emily and Izzy agree to get back together when the tour reaches Seattle. Eventually, Steel Dragon stops in Seattle for a show, and Emily arrives at his hotel room as they had previously arranged, although Izzy had become so inebriated while on tour he forgot about the arrangement and did not even know what city he was in. Although <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> all <b>the</b> groupies, Emily still tries to reconnect with him, reminding him of their plans to meet up once he got to Seattle, however he is too intoxicated to really understand what she is saying, eventually suggesting they go to Seattle together. Heartbroken with his inconsiderate behavior, intoxication {{and the fact that he}} is sleeping with so many groupies, Emily leaves him.|$|R
5000|$|Heather Phares of Allmusic {{reviewed}} the Scrooged soundtrack album, and stated [...] "The soundtrack to [...] "Scrooged" [...] features updates on Christmas classics {{as well as}} original material by Dan Hartman and Denise Love, Mark Lennon, Robbie Robertson, and Buster Poindexter. The album's sound, {{as well as its}} roster of artists, give it the feel of a time capsule buried in the late '80s, for better or worse. Most of the album brings back bad memories of the cold, brassy sound that dominated the decade's pop. Though [...] "Scrooged" [...] may appeal to fans of the movie, they may be <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> how badly <b>the</b> soundtrack has aged." ...|$|R
25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer {{a similar fate}} if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers worry about their own future. The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time}} in August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's direct writing style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E
25|$|After several weeks, they {{traveled}} to Amritsar, staying near the Harmandir Sahib and worshipping at a Sikh gurudwara. They also read English- and Sanskrit-language books, exposing Tagore to astronomy, biographies of such figures as Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Later, in mid-April, Tagore {{and his father}} set off for the remote and frigid Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie, India, near what is now Himachal Pradesh's border with Kashmir. There, at an elevation of some 2,300meters (7,500feet), {{they lived in a}} house high atop Bakrota hill. Tagore was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> region's deep gorges, alpine forests, and mossy streams and waterfalls. Yet Tagore was also made to study lessons — including such things as Sanskrit declensions — starting in the icy pre-dawn twilight. Tagore took a break from his readings for a noontime meal; thereafter, Tagore was to continue his studies, although he was often allowed to fall asleep. Some two months later, Tagore left his father in Dalhousie and journeyed back to Calcutta.|$|E
25|$|The {{village is}} named after the 6th century Irish Christian missionary Saint Buriana (also {{sometimes}} called Beriana, Buriena, or Beriena). The local legend describes how, whilst ministering to the local inhabitants from the oratory that stood {{on the site of}} the current church, Saint Buriana was abducted by the local king, Geraint (or Gereint) of Dumnonia. Saint Piran, patron saint of Cornwall and also a fellow missionary, negotiated for her release, but the reticent Geraint agreed only on the caveat that he be awoken by a cuckoo calling across the snow, something which would be highly unlikely in mid-winter. The legend states that Saint Piran prayed through the night whilst the snow fell, and in the morning Geraint was awoken by a cuckoo's song. He was so <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> miracle that he honoured his pledge, however, shortly afterwards he changed his mind and tried to recapture Buriana. Buriana is said to have died as Geraint tried to re-imprison her, and was purportedly buried on the site of her chapel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the general}} election, Murphy faced Republican {{incumbent}} Allen West, a freshman congressman {{who ran for}} reelection in the 18th after his former district, the 22nd, had been made significantly more Democratic in redistricting. In the general election, Murphy {{said that he was}} so <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> things West was saying in Congress and on television that he felt compelled to run against him. Allen had called Democrats [...] "Communists", said that Social Security was [...] "akin to slavery", and had fired a pistol near a prisoner's head when serving in the Iraq War. Murphy was supported by Florida's former Republican Governor Charlie Crist and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, along with Republican Sheriff of Martin County Bob Crowder, who ran against West in the primaries. The race was among the most expensive congressional races in 2012, and called one of the ugliest in the 2012 campaign, as well as one of the closest.|$|R
50|$|Their {{relationship}} would be challenged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news that Steve had a wife. While <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> and hurt <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news, Kayla continued the relationship. Then Kayla's boyfriend, Jack, shows up. Jack is madly in lovely with Kayla but Kayla does not return the feelings. Jack hopefully pursued Kayla {{because he thought}} eventually he would win her over. The Deveraux Family hired Kayla to be Jack's private nurse when {{he was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's Disease and quite ill. Steve learned the truth that Jack was his own brother, Billy. When he did, he shunned Kayla, hoping she would end up with Jack so his brother would have someone special with whom to spend his seemingly final days. Believing Steve was no longer interested in her, Kayla accepted a marriage proposal from Jack.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George is so entirely {{overcome}} {{at first}} by this prospect that he resists the proposed honour with great earnestness. Being overborne, however, {{by his brother}} and his nephew--concerning whom he renews his protestations that he never could have thought {{they would have been}} half so glad to see him--he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children. Here Mr. George is much dismayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> beauty of Rosa, his niece that is to be, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> affectionate salutations of these young ladies, which he receives in a sort of dream. He is sorely <b>taken</b> <b>aback,</b> too, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dutiful behaviour of his nephew and has a woeful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace. However, there is great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment, and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all, and his pledge to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with universal favour. A whirling head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the state-bed of his brother's house to think of all these things and to see the images of his nieces (awful all the evening in their floating muslins) waltzing, after the German manner, over his counterpane.|$|R
500|$|... "Goodbyeee" [...] went a {{good deal}} further than any other sitcom or comedy, by terminally sending pretty much the entire cast over the top in 1917, into a silence that has ... endured ever since. Many {{millions}} of viewers were shocked, and almost all <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> abrupt realization of tragedy amid much-loved national television and after riotous laughter to that sudden and bitter end ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Darkness" [...] had {{the desired}} effect; Lineberger wrote that [...] "I was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dark tone and {{emotional}} range generated by this episode. Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I {{cared about the}} characters as though I know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling." [...] Abramowitz said that Tessa's death strongly angered many viewers, and that [...] "...people hated me for killing her." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sept haï-kaïs {{received}} limited success—music {{critics were}} {{for the most part}} <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brevity of the mélodies. [...] Gustave Samazeuilh mentioned only [...] "the very brief but very musical Japanese songs". [...] In an article for le Ménestrel, Paul Bertrand summed up the general public sentiment, seeing in the vocal cycle [...] "a succession of sketches, often charming but very brief, so brief that no impression of any of them had the time to affirm itself".|$|E
500|$|Batman Returns was {{released}} in 1992 with financial success and generally favorable reviews from critics, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with its box office run, having made $150 million less than the first film. Director Tim Burton was asked to restrict himself {{to the role of}} producer, with approval of Joel Schumacher as director and the husband and wife screenwriting couple Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, who agreed with him that [...] "the key element to Batman is his duality. And it's not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne". Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be [...] "lighted down". Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of Frank Miller's [...] Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's childhood with some events of the comic The Dark Knight Returns. Akiva Goldsman, who worked with Schumacher on The Client, was brought in to rewrite the script. Burton, who was more interested in directing Ed Wood, later reflected he was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> focus group meetings for Batman Forever, a title which he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio's aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal.|$|R
5000|$|The A Team' {{came from}} an {{experience}} I had when I did a gig at a homeless shelter", says Sheeran of the song. [...] "I was 18 {{at the time and}} kind of quite naïve. So, I was a bit <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> stories that I heard. I got home that night and I just wrote a lot of the lyrics. I wanted to write it so it sounded kind of upbeat, so you wouldn't really know what it's about, because it's quite a dark subject." [...] In a 2011 video interview with Absolute Radio, Sheeran stated that it was based on the experiences of a particular woman at the shelter, named Angel, hence the 'Angels to fly' line in the song. In a video interview with Billboard, Sheeran explained the song's title. [...] "A drug like crack cocaine is called a 'Class A drug'. That's in the same category as heroin. Instead of making it clear and just saying what the problem was, I'd say, 'She's in the 'Class A' team.' It was kind of my way of covering up (a person's addiction), I guess, making it a bit more subtle." [...] The single was released 1 May 2011, in the UK through Atlantic Records. In US, [...] "The A Team" [...] was serviced to adult album alternative (also triple-A, AAA, or adult alternative) stations on 27 February 2012.|$|R
