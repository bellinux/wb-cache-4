5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head in the finished episode.|$|E

A week later, Dark Angel made her debut for World Wonder Ring Stardom, during which she affiliated herself with Io Shirai's Planet stable. In a six-woman tag team match, which celebrated Dark Angel's ten-year anniversary in professional wrestling, she, Shirai and Arisa Hoshiki defeated Eri Susa, Hiroyo Matsumoto and Miho Wakizawa.

In Dark Angel's final match of the tour on October 3, she and Io Shirai wrestled Miho Wakizawa and Nanae Takahashi to a twenty-minute time limit draw. Dark Angel was scheduled to return to Stardom on March 3, 2013, but due to a visa issue, she had to postpone her return until March 10, when she, Io Shirai and Yuzuki Aikawa defeated Act Yasukawa, Natsuki☆Taiyo and Yoshiko in a six-woman tag team main event. On March 24, Dark Angel entered a four-woman tournament to determine the number one contender to the World of Stardom Championship.
