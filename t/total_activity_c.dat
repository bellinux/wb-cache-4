40|$|This work {{presents}} a stock-effort dynamical {{model of a}} fishery subdivided on several fishing zones. The stock corresponds to a fish population moving between different zones, on which they are harvested by fishing fleets. The bio-economical model {{is a set of}} ODE's governing the fishing efforts and the stocks on the different fishing zones. We take profit from the existence of two time scales (a fast one for fish migration and fleets movements, and a slow one for fish growth and mortality and fleets revenue) to construct a reduced (aggregated) model. The aggregated model describes the global evolution of the harvested stock as well as the total fishing effort. The mathematical analysis of the model allows the optimization of the spatial distribution of the fishing effort and the identification of an efficient set of management measures, which corresponds in one hand to set an appropriate system of tax and/or subsidies, {{and on the other hand}} to control the displacement of the fleets between the fishing zones, in order to increase the <b>total</b> <b>activity.</b> (<b>c)</b> 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Microbial {{infections are}} {{a major threat to}} public health {{particularly}} in developing countries due to the relative unavailability of medicine and the emergence of widespread drug resistance. Serious invasive fungal infections caused by Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus spp. represents an increasing threat to human health. They have increased significantly during the past decade, especially in immunocompromised individuals, due to the increased occurrence of HIV infections and resistance development. The toxicity of available antifungal drugs/agents has contributed greatly to the need for new antifungal drugs. Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast organism that causes cryptococcosis in both humans and animals. This disease develops following inhalation and dissemination of the organism from the lungs to the central nervous system. Infection with C. neoformans often produces pneumonia and cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients. The problem with this fungus is that AIDS patients respond poorly to treatment and need lifelong therapy to suppress the infection and the drug treatment may be expensive in developing countries. This indicates an urgent need to develop new specific fungicidal antimicrobial agents for the treatment of cryptococcosis. Plants synthesize a large number of secondary metabolites for protecting themselves against microbe infections caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses. These substances may be useful in the treatment of microbial infections in humans and animals. Plants can be considered as potential sources of therapeutic extracts or active pure chemical compounds for the development of medicines. During this project, ten plant species (Zanthoxylum capenses, Morus mesozygia, Calodendron capenses, Catha transvaalensis, Cussonia zuluensis, Ochna natalitia, Croton sylvaticus, Maytenus undata, Celtis africana and Cassine aethiopica) were screened for activity against C. neoformans using both bioautography and the microdilution assay. The most active plant species was selected for the isolation of active metabolites. The selection of plant species was based on the lowest MIC value, presence of clear zones on bioautograms indicating antifungal activity, and high total activity against C. neoformans. M. undata indicated the presence of clear zones on bioautograms, a low average MIC value of 0. 09 mg/ml and high <b>total</b> <b>activity.</b> <b>C.</b> sylvaticus and C. transvaalensis had lower or equal average MIC values to M. undata of 0. 07 mg/ml and 0. 09 mg/ml respectively. However a lack of clear bands to identify the position of active compounds on bioautography plates disqualified them for further analysis in this study. The leaves of M. undatawere exhaustively extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, acetone and methanol respectively. The hexane extract indicated the lowest MIC value of 0. 02 mg/ml and was used for isolation of the active constituents. Column chromatography and bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of six triterpene-like compounds. The structure of the isolated compounds was elucidated using the NMR and MS techniques and the compounds were identified as friedelin (1), epifriedelanol (2), taraxerol (3), 3 -oxo- 11 á-methoxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (4), 3 -oxo- 11 á-hydroxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (5) & 3, 11 -dihydroxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (6). Friedelin (1) and epifriedelanol (2) belong to the friedelane group of triterpenoids, taraxerol (3) belongs to the taraxerane group and 3 -oxo- 11 á-methoxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (4), 3 -oxo- 11 á-hydroxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (5) & 3, 11 -dihydroxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (6) belong to the 12 -oleanene group. These groups have been isolated previously from plants that belong to the Celastraceae family. Four of the six isolated compounds 1, 3, 5 and 6 were isolated in sufficient quantity to be assayed against two fungal species (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans), two Gram-positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis, ATCC 29212) and two Gram-negative bacterial species (Escherichia coli, ATCC 27853 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC 25922). Two of the compounds, 3 -oxo- 11 á-hydroxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (5) & 3, 11 -dihydroxyolean- 12 -ene- 30 -oic acid (6), showed clear bands against all the tested organisms on bioautograms indicating microbial growth inhibition. MIC values ranged from 24 µg/ml to 63 µg/ml except for S. a ureus which was resistant. All the tested microorganisms showed resistance against friedelin (1) and taraxerol (3) with MIC values of > 250 µg/ml, except for E. faecalis with an MIC value of 130 µg/ml for taraxerol. The cytotoxicity of the hexane extract and the isolated compounds were investigated using the tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT) using Vero monkey kidney cells and the hemagglutination assay using formaldehyde-fixed erythrocytes (RBCs). The hexane plant extract indicated toxicity towards the Vero monkey cells with an LC 50 of 0. 076 mg/ml. Compounds 1 and 3 indicated no toxicity against the cells with an LC 50 greater than 200 µg/ml. However compounds 5 and 6 indicated toxicity with an LC 50 of 6. 16 µg/ml and 3. 36 /ml, respectively. Also the hemagglutination assay indicates that hexane extract is toxic towards the RBCs with a HA titer value of 1. 6. Both compounds 1 and 3 indicated no agglutination and compounds 5 and 6 indicated HA titer values of 1. 33 and 0. 67, respectively. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cystatin C is a constitutively {{expressed}} {{and abundant}} cysteine protease inhibitor within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Recent {{studies have reported}} {{a significant reduction in}} cystatin C concentration in the CSF of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and several other neurodegenerative diseases, relative to healthy controls. Cystatin C can exhibit both neuroprotective and neurotoxic properties, suggesting that altered CSF cystatin C concentrations could potentially impact the pathogenesis or progression of these disorders. However, it is unclear if alterations in cystatin C concentration result in physiologically relevant differences in its functional activity within the CSF. Measurements of the cysteine protease inhibitory <b>activity</b> of cystatin <b>C</b> within the CSF have not been reported, and the relationship between CSF cystatin <b>C</b> concentration and <b>activity</b> levels in different disease contexts has not been investigated. METHODS: We used a papain inhibition assay to evaluate the <b>total</b> cystatin <b>C</b> <b>activity</b> in CSF samples from 23 ALS patients, 23 healthy controls, and 23 neurological disease controls. Cystatin C concentrations in these samples were previously measured by ELISA. Correlations between cystatin <b>C</b> concentration and <b>activity</b> were assessed with nonparametric statistics. Activity ratios were compared among diagnostic groups using both one-way ANOVA and repeated measures statistics. RESULTS: <b>Total</b> cystatin <b>C</b> <b>activity</b> was found to be directly proportional to its protein concentration in all subjects, and cystatin <b>C</b> <b>activity</b> was not altered in ALS patients. In addition, our data suggest that cystatin C is the predominant cysteine protease inhibitor in human CSF. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the successful measurement of the functional <b>activity</b> of cystatin <b>C</b> in the CSF, and show that <b>total</b> cystatin <b>C</b> <b>activity</b> can be inferred from its total protein concentration. Our results also suggest that cystatin C is the major cysteine protease inhibitor in human CSF and altered CSF cystatin C concentration {{may play a role in}} the pathobiology of ALS and other neurological diseases...|$|R

The assay involves scavenging of an ABTS [2, 2 '-azinobis-(3 -ethyl-benzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) ] radical generated by the reaction of potassium persulphate with ABTS to produce an ABTS center dot(+) chromophore (lambda = 734 nm). Antioxidants reduce ABTS center dot(+) back to ABTS with a concomitant decrease in absorbance. Aqueous extractions from C arabica and S. leprosula had considerably higher (110 - 205 mu mol Trolox eq. g(- 1) FW) <b>total</b> antioxidant <b>activities</b> than P sitchensis and R. nigrum (6 - 11 mu mol Trolox eq. g(- 1) FW).

The ability of Candida to grow as a biofilm is an important feature that promotes both infection and persistence in the host.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the metabolic activity of in vitro biofilms formed by different clinical isolates of NCAC species. The in situ <b>total</b> metabolic <b>activity</b> of <b>C.</b> parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata biofilms was determined using 2, 3 -(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulphophenyl) - 5 - [(phenylamino) carbonyl]- 2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay, and the number of cultivable cells was also established by CFU (colony forming unit) counts. The biofilm structure was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that <b>total</b> biofilm metabolic <b>activity</b> was species and strain dependent.

The amplitude of circadian responses to light were approximately 2. 5 greater, the circadian period (z) was reduced (e. 20 min) and the <b>total</b> duration of <b>activity</b> (<b>c</b> 0 was increased (e. 50 min) when compared to wild type (+/+) and rd]rd mice (retinal degeneration, mice which also lack rod photoreceptors) of the same genetic background.

The produced radioactivity was calculated and measured by means of proportional counters located at the main exhaust of the laboratory. These devices were designed for precise assessment of air contamination for radiation protection purposes. The main produced isotopes were 11 C, 13 N and 14 O. Both measurements and calculations correspond to two different irradiation conditions. In the former, protons were allowed to travel for their full range in air. In the latter, they were stopped at the distance of 1. 5 m by a beam dump. Radioactivity was measured continuously in the exhausted air starting from 2 min {{after the end of}} irradiation. For this reason, the short-lived 14 O isotope gave a negligible contribution to the measured activity. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the calculations within the estimated uncertainties.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} levels {{of physical activity}} in {{a representative sample of}} preschool children and to quantify tracking of activity over 1 year. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Physical activity (mean accelerometry counts/minute) was assessed over 3 days using the Computer Science and Applications accelerometer in 3 - to 4 -year-old children (n = 104; 52 boys; mean age, 3. 7 +/- 0. 4 years). In 60 children (30 boys), measurements were repeated 1 year later. RESULTS: Mean <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> at baseline was 777 +/- 207 counts/minute in boys and 657 +/- 172 counts/minute for girls; this gender difference was significant (p &# 60; 0. 001). In the cross-sectional analysis, <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> was significantly positively related to age (r = 0. 37, p = 0. 007). In the sample followed up for 1 year, mean <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> was 849 +/- 252. The longitudinal analysis confirmed that <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> increased over the 1 -year period (paired Student's t test, p &# 60; 0. 001). The tracking rank order correlation coefficient of <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> count over 1 year was r = 0. 40 (p &# 60; 0. 001). DISCUSSION: This study suggests that <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> increases during the preschool period in Scottish children and that gender differences in <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> are present early in life. Tracking of <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> was only modest, but adequate assessment of tracking requires methodological research aimed at elucidating the biological meaning of accelerometer output...|$|R

Examination of his serum disclosed antinuclear antibodies but no <b>total</b> haemolytic complement <b>activity.</b> <b>C</b> 2 was absent. Serum concentrations of C 1 s, C 3, C 5 and C 9 were elevated; other complement components were present in normal concentration, including C 3 pro-activator. The patient's C 3 pro-activator was electrophoretically converted by inulin and four of five lipopolysaccharides, but was poorly converted by aggregated human IgG. Two separate turnover studies with radiolabelled C 3 showed fractional catabolic rates of 3 - 03 and 2 - 48 % of the remaining plasma pool/hr (range of three normals: 1 - 62 - 2 - 18 %/hr); and estimated C 3 synthetic rates of 2 - 74 and 2 - 31 mg/kg/hr (range of three normals: 0 - 89 - 1 - 40 mg/kg/hr). Serum complement profiles of the patient's family demonstrated that the C 2 deficiency was inherited as an autosomal codominant. One sibling, homozygous for C 2 deficiency, and three other siblings, both parents and one daughter, all heterozygous for C 2 deficiency, are in good health.

40|$|Plant {{production}} in the Brazilian savannas, {{also known as the}} Cerrados, is limited mainly by low P availability. In tropical soils, rich in sesquioxides, P supply of plants depends heavily on the transformation of organic P by phosphatase enzymes into HPO 4 2 - and H 2 PO 4 -. We examined two Oxisols-one clayey and one loamy-under different land uses for their potential acid monophosphatase activity (PAMA) and potential microbial activity. We measured dimethyl sulfoxide reduction, pH, total C and N, and NaOH-extractable organic and inorganic P. For all parameters other than pH, values were about twice as high in the clayey as in the loamy soil. Land use was found to strongly affect phosphatase activity, which was reduced by both cropping and reforestation. In the clayey soil, pastures seemed to {{have a positive effect on}} phosphatase activity. A change of continuous cropping to pasture resulted in a rapid recovery of phosphatase activity, microbial <b>activity,</b> and <b>C</b> and N levels. However, it retained the high inorganic P (Pi) levels found in fertilized crops. A comparison of phosphatase activity with microbial <b>activity,</b> <b>total</b> <b>C</b> and N, and P fractions showed that phosphatase was strongly related to microbial activity in the soil and therefore depended much more on soil organic matter than on soil P levels. We also found that, although PAMA is useful for indicating a soil`s P mineralization capacity, it does not indicate actual P mineralization rates. However, when combined with findings for microbial activity and Pi, it indicates the level of microbially available P, a lack of which probably implies strong competition between plants and microorganisms for this element...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the associations of accelerometer-derived <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day and minutes of bouted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with insulin resistance. MethodsThe sample included 2, 394 adults (aged 22 ̆ 030520 y) from the 200322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Time spent in MVPA, measured by using 2 cutpoints (22 ̆ 03052, 020 counts/min [MVPA 2, 020] and 22 ̆ 0305760 counts/min [MVPA 760]), was calculated for bouts of at least 8 to 10 minutes. <b>Total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day reflects the <b>total</b> amount of <b>activity</b> across all intensities. Insulin resistance was measured via the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Two nested regression models regressed HOMA-IR and QUICKI, respectively, on minutes of bouted MVPA and <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day. We used an adjusted Wald F statistic to illustrate strength of association. ResultsAfter adjustment for covariates, <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day was more strongly associated with both HOMA-IR (adjusted Wald F = 36. 83, P <. 001) and QUICKI (adjusted Wald F = 29. 44, P <. 001) compared with MVPA 2, 020 (HOMA-IR, adjusted Wald F = 4. 00, P =. 06; QUICKI, adjusted Wald F = 1. 08, P =. 31). <b>Total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day was more strongly associated with both HOMA-IR (adjusted Wald F = 13. 64, P <. 001) and QUICKI (adjusted Wald F = 12. 10, P <. 001) compared with MVPA 760 (HOMA-IR, adjusted Wald F = 1. 13, P =. 30; QUICKI, adjusted Wald F = 0. 97, P =. 33). ConclusionOur study indicated that <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day has stronger associations with insulin resistance compared with minutes of bouted MVPA. The most likely explanation is that <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day captures data on light physical activity and intermittent MVPA, both of which influence insulin resistance. 27763832 PMC 507275...|$|R
