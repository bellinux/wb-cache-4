50|$|The <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> is {{normally}} set by sight to create satisfactory skin tones in a picture. The range of adjustment typically allows these colors {{to be adjusted}} from a green to a magenta tint. Television sets produced in recent decades typically include a (sometimes non-defeatable) distortion of the color decoding spectrum, to minimize the visual effects of phase error and lessen the need to adjust the <b>tint</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
50|$|NTSC {{receivers}} have a <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> {{to perform}} colour correction manually. If {{this is not}} adjusted correctly, the colours may be faulty. The PAL standard automatically cancels hue errors by phase reversal, so a <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> is unnecessary yet Saturation control can be more useful. Chrominance phase errors in the PAL system are cancelled out using a 1H delay line resulting in lower saturation, which is much less noticeable to the eye than NTSC hue errors.|$|E
5000|$|Because the NTSC color {{television}} standard {{relies on the}} absolute phase of the color information, color errors occur when the phase of the video signal is altered between source and receiver. To correct for phase errors, a <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> is provided on NTSC television sets, which allows the user to manually adjust the phase relationship between the color information in the video and the reference for decoding the color information, known as the [...] "color burst", so that correct colors may be displayed.|$|E
40|$|The {{lighting}} simulation programme Radiance is used {{to predict}} daylight factors and the illuminance distribution in a room which is 12 m x 12 m x 3. 6 m high, with grey <b>tinted</b> solar <b>control</b> glazing. These predictions are compared with measurements taken simultaneously in the real room and in a physical model placed outside. Radiance {{is also used to}} predict the lighting conditions under a CIE overcast sky distribution. These latter predictions are compared to the predictions obtained by placing the physical model in a mirror box artificial sky. Specific attention is paid to testing the accuracy of results, and the balance between computer calculation time and Radiance rendering settings. Finally the computer model {{is used to}} explore the affect of adjusting light shelf finish. The relative contribution of view window beneath the light shelf and clerestory window above is also examined...|$|R
50|$|The Maybach 62 {{includes}} many luxury {{features such as}} fully reclining rear seats, Maybach four-zone climate <b>control,</b> <b>tinted</b> windows, infrared-reflecting laminated glass all round, AirMATIC dual-control air suspension, display instruments in rear roof liner (showing speed, time, and outside temperature), folding rear tables (left and right), BOSE Surround Everywhere sound system, and a refrigerator compartment.The Maybach 62 also includes an array of additional features such as Cockpit Management and Navigation System (COMAND), which includes DVD navigation, CD changer in rear seats, DVD players and TV tuners front and rear, two rear LCD TV screens including remote control and two sets of headphones, and automatic closing doors.|$|R
40|$|A {{second study}} of 38 subjects, ages 22 - 62, was {{conducted}} to study the difference between Gunnar Optiks computer spectacles and control glasses with small changes in base curve or <b>tint.</b> The two <b>control</b> pairs of eyeglasses were in similar frames, and both sets of lenses were made of similar resin with antireflective coating. One control pair had gray-tinted lenses were made with the same optical power as the Gunnar Optiks design. The other had the same yellow tint, but a flatter base curve and face form than the Gunnar design. Under stressful conditions of glare and dry air induced by a fan, electromyography of the eyelid to quantify squinting and blinking, tear volume measurement using Zone Quick phenol red thread, and subjective symptoms experienced with each type of glasses were made. Statistical analysis revealed {{no significant difference between}} the Gunnar Optiks design and the control glasses under these conditions...|$|R
50|$|Early color sets {{intended}} for the UK market had a PAL decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by Telefunken of Germany, who invented the PAL color system. The decoder inside the UK-sold Sony color Trinitron sets, from the KV-1300UB to the KV-1330UB, had an NTSC decoder adapted for PAL. The decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line, but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line, it simply repeated the same line twice. Any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> knob {{on the front of}} the set, normally unneeded on a PAL set.|$|E
50|$|The {{system used}} in The Americas {{and much of}} the Far East is NTSC. Western Europe, Australia, Africa, and Eastern South America use PAL (though Brazil uses a hybrid PAL-M system). Eastern Europe and France uses SECAM. Generally, a device (such as a television) can only read or display video encoded to a {{standard}} which the device is designed to support; otherwise, the source must be converted (such as when European programs are broadcast in North America or vice versa). Because a <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> is unnecessary in PAL, NTSC has jokingly been said to stand for Never The Same Color or Never Twice the Same Color.Similarly, SECAM has been said to stand for Something Entirely Contrary to the AMericans and PAL to stand for Pay for Additional Luxury or People Are Lilac.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the problem}} of phase errors {{in the real world}} became well known after the {{introduction}} of NTSC, the later PAL and SECAM color television standards attempted to correct for them. PAL uses the same color modulation scheme as NTSC but averages the received color information over adjacent scan lines, resulting in reduced color detail but canceling out small to moderate phase errors. (Severe phase errors result in picture grain and loss of color saturation in the PAL scheme.) SECAM uses a different modulation scheme that does not rely on the phase of the color signal. Because of this the amplitude of the color signal (color saturation) is unaffected as well. Because SECAM only broadcasts half the color information on each line, the color resolution is halved just like in the PAL system. Most TV sets designed for these later standards lack tint controls, as PAL and SECAM are not supposed to experience the problems a <b>tint</b> <b>control</b> would correct. (This leaves the viewer unable to correct for color errors originating at the transmission site, however.) Multistandard sets have tint controls for NTSC viewing, but the controls are inoperative when watching PAL or SECAM signals.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of selected shading devices on office room temperature. The experimental results were presented to show the thermal effects of coating systems used. Initial work for a duration of two months showed that high temperatures occurred during 10 : 00, 12 : 00 and 14 : 00 hours. The coating materials used, were plain glass pane with the thickness of 5 mm (<b>control),</b> <b>tinted</b> film, silver film, and blinds. Results showed that the differences in temperatures between the {{inside and outside of}} the office were 4. 4 Â°C, 3. 8 Â°C, 3. 5 Â°C and 2. 9 Â°C for silver film, blinds, tinted film and clear glass (5 mm), respectively. In terms of cost, the blinds proved to be low in cost with every temperature drop for temperature difference between internal and external temperatures. For every degree difference, silver coating would cost RM 6. 80 /Â°C, tinted laminating RM 4. 57 /Â°C, blind RM 1. 97 /Â°C, and clean glass (5 mm) RM 1. 90 / Â°C. RM is Malaysian Ringgit and 1 Euro= 4. 50 RM. In addition the blinds could be easily fixed comparatively...|$|R
40|$|Implantation of rat {{prostate}} cancer cells into the normal rat prostate results in tumor-stimulating {{changes in the}} tumor-bearing organ, for example growth of the vasculature, an altered extracellular matrix, and influx of inflammatory cells. To investigate this response further, we compared prostate morphology and the gene expression profile of tumor-bearing normal rat prostate tissue (termed tumor-instructed/indicating normal tissue (TINT)) with that of prostate tissue from controls. Dunning rat AT- 1 {{prostate cancer}} cells were injected into rat prostate and tumors were established after 10 days. As controls we used intact animals, animals injected with heat-killed AT- 1 cells or cell culture medium. None of the controls showed morphological TINT-changes. A rat Illumina whole-genome expression array was used to analyze gene expression in AT- 1 tumors, TINT, and in medium injected prostate tissue. We identified 423 upregulated genes and 38 downregulated genes (p= 2 -fold change) in <b>TINT</b> relative to <b>controls.</b> Quantitative RT-PCR analysis verified key TINT-changes, {{and they were not}} detected in controls. Expression of some genes was changed {{in a manner similar to}} that in the tumor, whereas other changes were exclusive to TINT. Ontological analysis using GeneGo software showed that the TINT gene expression profile was coupled to processes such as inflammation, immune response, and wounding. Many of the genes whose expression is altered in TINT have well-established roles in tumor biology, and the present findings indicate that they may also function by adapting the surrounding tumor-bearing organ to the needs of the tumor. Even though a minor tumor cell contamination in TINT samples cannot be ruled out, our data suggest that there are tumor-induced changes in gene expression in the normal tumor-bearing organ which can probably not be explained by tumor cell contamination. It is important to validate these changes further, as they could hypothetically serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic markers of prostate cancer...|$|R
5000|$|Reception {{problems}} can degrade an NTSC picture {{by changing the}} phase of the color signal (actually differential phase distortion), so the color balance of the picture will be altered unless a compensation {{is made in the}} receiver. The vacuum-tube electronics used in televisions through the 1960s led to various technical problems. Among other things, the color burst phase would often drift when channels were changed, which is why NTSC televisions were equipped with a <b>tint</b> <b>control.</b> PAL and SECAM televisions had no need of one, and although it is still found on NTSC TVs, color drifting generally ceased to be a problem for more modern circuitry by the 1970s. When compared to PAL in particular, NTSC color accuracy and consistency is sometimes considered inferior, leading to video professionals and television engineers jokingly referring to NTSC as Never The Same Color, Never Twice the Same Color, or No True Skin Colors, while for the more expensive PAL system it was necessary to Pay for Additional Luxury. PAL has also been referred to as Peace At Last, Perfection At Last or Pictures Always Lovely in the color war. This mostly applied to vacuum tube-based TVs, however, and later-model solid state sets using Vertical Interval Reference signals have less of a difference in quality between NTSC and PAL. This color phase, [...] "tint", or [...] "hue" [...] control allows for anyone skilled in the art to easily calibrate a monitor with SMPTE color bars, even with a set that has drifted in its color representation, allowing the proper colors to be displayed. Older PAL television sets did not come with a user accessible [...] "hue" [...] control (it was set at the factory), which contributed to its reputation for reproducible colors.|$|E
