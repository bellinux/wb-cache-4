5|$|MacArthur did not {{get along}} with Carpender, and twice asked {{for him to be}} {{replaced}}, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> in November 1943 when King replaced Carpender with Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid without informing MacArthur or seeking the approval of the Australian government. However, a face-saving formula was agreed upon. For the invasion of Leyte, the Seventh Fleet was massively reinforced by ships from the Pacific Fleet. Cover was provided by Admiral William F. Halsey's Third Fleet, which remained under Nimitz. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the divided command brought the Allies to the brink of disaster when misunderstandings arose between Kinkaid and Halsey. Allied Naval Forces was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E
25|$|One view of {{difference}} between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> one's actions must be revealed to others. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate {{as to whether or}} not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others.|$|E
25|$|In {{the prelude}} to the patriation of the Canadian {{constitution}} in 1982, some First Nations leaders campaigned for and some against the proposed move, many asserting that the federal ministers of the Crown {{had no right to}} advise the Queen that she sever, without consent from the First Nations, the treaty rights she and her ancestors had long granted to Aboriginal Canadians. Worrying to them was the fact that their relationship with the monarch had, over the preceding century, come to be interpreted by Indian Affairs officials as one of subordination to the government—a misreading on the part of non-Aboriginals of the terms Great White Mother and her Indian Children. Indeed, First Nations representatives were locked out of constitutional conferences in the late 1970s, leading the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) to make plans to petition the Queen directly. The Liberal Cabinet at the time, not wishing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by having the monarch intervene, extended to the NIB an invitation to talks at the ministerial level, though not the first ministers' meetings. But the invite came just before the election in May 1979, which put the Progressive Conservative Party into Cabinet and the new ministers of the Crown decided to advise the Queen not to meet with the NIB delegation, while telling the NIB that the Queen had no power. The ministers of the Crown eventually reversed their position and offered a similar invitation to constitutional talks, but the NIB party, consisting of over 200 people, had already departed for London.|$|E

5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> and often removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{criterion}} of embarrassment {{is a type}} of critical analysis in which an account likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> its author <b>is</b> presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true because the author would have no reason to invent an embarrassing account about him- or herself. Some Biblical scholars have used this criterion in assessing whether the New Testament's accounts of Jesus' actions and words are historically probable.|$|R
500|$|Outside the Convention in Philadelphia, {{there was}} a {{national}} convening of the Society of the Cincinnati. Washington was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed.</b> The 1776 [...] "old republican" [...] delegates like Elbridge Gerry (MA) found anything military or hereditary anathema. The Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia and New York convention was meeting to redefine its Confession, dropping the faith requirement for civil authority to prohibit false worship. Protestant Episcopalian Washington attended a Roman Catholic Mass and dinner. Revolution veteran Jonas Phillips, of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue, petitioned the Convention to avoid a national oath including belief in both Old and New Testaments. Merchants of Providence, Rhode Island, petitioned for consideration, though their Assembly had not sent a delegation.|$|E
500|$|The Canadiens {{failed to}} repeat {{their success in}} 1993–94, as the team was {{eliminated}} from the playoffs by the Bruins in seven games. Montreal's loss in Game 6 was the last playoff game ever played at the Montreal Forum. The team missed the playoffs entirely in 1994–95, {{the first time in}} 25 years the Canadiens did not qualify, and the third time in 55 seasons. Montreal rebounded to make the playoffs in 1995–96, but the future of the team was altered on December 2, 1995, when the Canadiens were embarrassed 11–1 by the Red Wings. Patrick Roy allowed nine goals on 26 shots before he was pulled in the second period to mock cheers from the Montreal crowd. Roy was furious, and felt that head coach Mario Tremblay deliberately left him in <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed.</b> After reaching the bench, he moved past Tremblay to Canadiens President Ronald Corey, who was seated in the first row, and declared, [...] "This is my last game in Montreal." ...|$|E
500|$|Cott was a protege of John Graham Kerr who had quarrelled with Norman Wilkinson in the First World War about dazzle {{camouflage}} for ships. Wilkinson remained {{influential in}} 1939 as an inspector of camouflage, so a political argument developed. Cott {{was invited to}} camouflage a 12-inch rail-mounted gun, alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally. Cott carefully combined disruptive contrast {{to break up the}} gun barrel's outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder. The guns were then photographed from the air from various angles, and in Peter Forbes's view [...] "the results were remarkable." [...] Cott's gun is [...] "invisible except to the most minute scrutiny by someone who knows exactly where to look and what to look for. The other gun is always highly visible." [...] The authorities hesitated, appearing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by the evidence that Cott was right, and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation. Cott was posted to the Middle East, and Kerr unsuccessfully intervened, pleading for guns to be painted Cott's way and Cott to be brought home.|$|E
60|$|This {{might prove}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> {{and the only}} comfort she could give herself was that La Fleur was such an affectionate old body, always talking of some bit of good fortune for her, {{that if she had}} seen her in company with a king or an emperor, she would {{immediately}} set herself to find some sort of throne-covering which would suit her hair and complexion.|$|R

5000|$|After the Faithwear Cup was over, John Ward {{wrote on}} Cricinfo an article named [...] "A {{brief history of}} Zimbabwe cricket". Here, he ended the article by saying that,"The 2005-06 Logan Cup never took place after a {{disastrous}} Faithwear Trophy when sides were so feeble as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> ZC revamped the system, removed Mashonaland and Matabeleland (two of the leading opponents of the Chingoka regime) and unveilled a new competition for 2006-07." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Russian society appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by {{the court}} case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, {{carrying}} reports titled like [...] "Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{these early}} events caused Emin {{to be well}} known in art circles, she was largely unknown by the public until she {{appeared}} on a Channel 4 television programme in 1997. The show comprised a group discussion about that year's Turner Prize and was broadcast live. Emin said she was drunk, slurred and swore before walking out. From the interview: [...] "Are they really real people in England watching this programme now, they really watching, really watching it?... They're 25 minutes behind us, think about that... I'm leaving now, I wanna be with my friends, I wanna be with my mum. I'm gonna phone her, and she's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> about this conversation, this is live and I don't care. I don't give a fuck about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{preliminary}} marriage rites, Roman brides {{are supposed}} to have straddled the phallus of Mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse, according to Church Fathers who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of virginity. The Christian apologist Arnobius says that Roman matrons were taken for a ride (inequitare) on Tutunus's [...] "awful phallus" [...] with its [...] "immense shameful parts", but other sources specify that it is brides who learned through the ritual not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by sex: [...] "Tutinus, upon whose shameful lap sit brides, so that the god seems to sample their shame before the fact." [...] The 2nd-century grammarian Festus is the only classical Latin source to take note of the god, and the characterization of the rite by Christian sources is likely to be hostile or biased.|$|E

60|$|As Lord Montfort {{always had}} the duty of {{ushering}} {{the lady of the}} house to dinner, he never had the opportunity of conversing with Lady Berengaria, even had he wished it; but it was not all clear that he did wish it, and it seemed that he talked as much to her sisters and the laughing cousins as to herself, but still he did not go away, which was most strange, and commenced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Also in 698, Ashina Mochuo {{turned against}} Zhou and {{attacked}} Zhou's northern prefectures. [...] Wu Zetian made Li Xian the nominal commanding {{general of the}} army against Eastern Tujue, but made Di the deputy commanding general and actually {{in charge of the}} army. [...] Before Di's army could arrive, however, Ashina Mochuo completed his pillaging of the northern prefectures and withdrew; Di's army never engaged him. [...] Wu Zetian subsequently commissioned Di to tour the prefectures to pacify the people, and he was said to have done so well, helping refugees to return to their home, transporting food supplies to places needing them, repairing the roads, and helping the poor. [...] Fearful that other officials would trouble the people with demands for luxury items, he made a good example of eating unrefined foods and prohibiting harassment of the citizens. [...] Meanwhile, though, he was said to have looked down on Lou, not realizing that Lou had been the one that had recommended that he be made chancellor, until Wu Zetian revealed to him that fact, causing him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1929 {{delegates from}} around Japan were meeting in Kyoto for the All Japan Martial Arts Demonstration. Miyagi {{was unable to}} attend, and so he in turn asked his top student Jin’an Shinzato to go. While Shinzato was there, {{one of the other}} demonstrators asked him the name of the martial art he practiced. At this time, Miyagi had not yet named his style. Not wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed,</b> Shinz9ato improvised the name hanko-ryu ("half-hard style"). On his return to Okinawa Prefecture, he {{reported}} this incident to Chōjun Miyagi, who decided on the name Gōjū-ryū ("hard soft style") as a name for his style. Chojun Miyagi took the name from a line of the poem Hakku Kenpo, which roughly means: [...] "The eight laws of the fist," [...] and describes the eight precepts of the martial arts. This poem was part of the Bubishi and reads, Ho wa Gōjū wa Donto su [...] "the way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness," [...] or [...] "everything in the universe inhales soft and exhales hard." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{her divorce}} from Nick and his {{marriage}} to Phyllis, Sharon moved on by marrying a rival to the Newman family, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Bergman {{said that it was}} [...] "only appropriate" [...] that the couple found each other, explaining: [...] "Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> with Jack." [...] However, Bergman also noted that Jack's intamicy with her [...] "all happens so quickly" [...] which could indicate he was up to something manipulative. Case praised the marriage as being a good representation of modern-day marriages. Additionally, she felt that Sharon had [...] "lost her identity" [...] after divorcing Nick and Cassie's death, and found a new one in her marriage to Jack. Nick and Sharon remained close despite their separate marriages. In 2007, Nick ended up in a plane crash, losing his memory. When he returned, he thought it was 2005, believing he was married to Sharon and Cassie was alive. He even kissed Sharon; but regained his memory and returned to Phyllis and their infant daughter, Summer. Phyllis became jealous of Sharon's place in Nick's life, prompting her to write an article in their magazine Restless Style, in which she described Sharon as a [...] "needy" [...] "gum-chewing twit" [...] who twirls her hair. Nick was angry at Phyllis for berating the mother of his children, although it was evident that he still loved Sharon and was protective of her. Stafford said: [...] "He [...] Freaks. She wrote this scathing thing. But Nick says it's not appropriate for her to go after the mother of his son like that," ...|$|E
50|$|The double {{position}} of Zürich {{as a free}} imperial city and {{as a member of}} the Everlasting League <b>was</b> soon found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> both parties. In 1373 and again in 1393 the powers of the Constafel were limited and the majority in the executive secured to the craftsmen, who could then aspire to the burgomastership. Meanwhile, the town had been extending its rule far beyond its walls, a process which began in the 14th, and attained its height in the 15th century (1362-1467).|$|R
5000|$|According to two-time U. S. Women's Chess Champion Jennifer Shahade (author of Chess Bitch, a {{book about}} women chess players), Lisa quit the game partly because she was annoyed with being {{identified}} as a chess player. [...] "It got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> constantly being introduced as a chess champion at parties." [...] On her fame, Hickey said, [...] "I guess I was good copy. I don't think the things I did in chess forty years ago {{are the most important}} things in my life." ...|$|R

40|$|Writing {{literary}} criticism as a collaborative act {{is a complex}} operation. It requires similar interests, similar styles of writing and above all a similarity of critical perspective which must be neither so narrow as to inhibit original thinking nor so broad as to allow real differences to show. Even parallel lines of thought can follow tracks different enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> when the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> present a coherent and unified view of the subject. When {{the writer is a}} regional figure with a metropolitan publishing history the strain of diversity can be acute...|$|R

5000|$|Things {{went from}} bad to {{politically}} damaging for Briscoe, as the appointments proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for his administration. By 1978, Briscoe had named nearly every appointed person in state government. Relying heavily on an appointments secretary on securing the names of upstanding Texans to serve in these positions, Briscoe didn't notice a horrifying mistake the secretary made. Briscoe had appointed a dead man to the State Health Advisory Commission. His staunch critics howled at the embarrassing episode and the popular magazine, Texas Monthly awarded him the [...] "Bum Steer Award" [...] for the comic aspects of this appointment.|$|R
