Tax exemptions result from the belief that the burden of the inheritance tax might force family-owned companies to shut down the business. This is especially presumed when a company is facing a sudden death of its ceo. Yet, up to now, {{only a limited number of}} studies provide evidence for this specific reason of default. In this paper we test how fragile Flemish family businesses are at the moment of a forced transfer of the family firm, using survey data and accounting records for 273 family-owned companies. The ability to pay inheritance taxes is proxied by the liquid assets and the available and <b>tax-free</b> <b>reserves.</b> The analysis shows that if both liquid assets and <b>tax-free</b> <b>reserves</b> are taken into account, maximum 8, 4 % of the family-owned companies in the sample will face serious difficulties when confronted with the unforeseen decease of the ceo...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} stock prices and tax credits for new investment, which appear in the balance sheet as a <b>tax-free</b> <b>reserve.</b> A number of valuation models were developed for companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange during the period 1990 - 4. The empirical findings reveal that retained earnings committed to new investment, i. e. investment tax credits for future investments, are valued differently from both the remaining equity and the remaining earnings. Moreover, the empirical {{evidence suggests that the}} investment tax credits in Greece are not always viewed in a positive fashion by the stock market. ...|$|R
