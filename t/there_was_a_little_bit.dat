500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are [...] "ending for a while". [...] "I'm feeling {{optimistic about the future}} no matter what happens at this point", Ranaldo said. [...] "It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling – you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that [...] It remains to be seen at this point what happens. I think they are certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I'd just leave it at that." [...] Ranaldo also suggested there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. [...] "There's tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just happy right now to let the future take its course." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tomkinson {{thinks the}} impure motives behind {{the idea of}} God being pure spirit are only too obvious. He says it was {{originally}} a pagan form of self-flattery to imagine <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of God in us all. He traces its history from Nimrod, through Pythagoras to Pliny the Elder and tells how they loved to commission statues of themselves to impress others. Scriptural literalists (from Augustine to Richard Baxter) fall into a similar error of human imaginings. Yet there was always an underground stream of the truth. He cites the followers of Sabilis which we would probably label Sabellianism. Also the Athrapamorphets. These truth-sayers were persecuted by the dominant culture due to the take-over of the church {{by the state and}} because the Apostles [...] "preached the faith in a personal God, but in that they clothed it within the appellation of several titles, it appeared more intricate and mysterious" [...] than it really was.|$|E
2500|$|Nalbandian did {{not reach}} another Wimbledon final in 2003, as he was knocked out in the round of 16 by Tim Henman. He did however have an {{impressive}} run at the U.S. Open, taking out both of the Wimbledon finalists 20th seed Mark Philippoussis and second seed Roger Federer {{on the way to}} a semifinal matchup with Andy Roddick. It was the second time in less than a month that he had met Roddick in a high-stakes match, having lost to him in the final of the Rogers Cup a few weeks earlier. Nalbandian started strongly, taking a two sets to love lead, and held a match point in the third-set tiebreak. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of controversy during the match, when a fan yelled [...] "out" [...] at 7–7 in the tiebreak, causing Nalbandian to mishit his following shot when he thought the linesman was the one who called it. Roddick took the point and eventually prevailed in the tiebreak. Ultimately, he was unable to finish the match off and eventually lost 6–7, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, 6–3. He finished 2003 ranked No. 8 in the world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Warner Bros., using its new Vitaphone sound process. Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and The Jazz Singer follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound. Costar May McAvoy, according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. [...] "She pinned herself against a wall {{in the dark and}} watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'" [...] "Everybody was mad for the talkies," [...] said movie star Gregory Peck in a Newsweek interview. [...] "I remember [...] 'The Jazz Singer,' [...] when Al Jolson just burst into song, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of dialogue. And when he came out with 'Mammy,' and went down on his knees to his Mammy, it was just dynamite." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of the {{dramatic}} shift from one {{show to the}} other, Debnam-Carey stated, [...] "It was super weird, it was like 'I have no power anymore! No weapons, no power!' But maybe eventually, Alica {{will be able to}} have her own kind of power." [...] Lexa, with [...] "such an iconic look and distinct wardrobe," [...] was an alien role for Debnam-Carey. She stated, [...] "I signed on for this role at a time in my personal and work life when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a lull period. I was like, 'I don't know what I'm doing!' It was one of those actor freak-out moments." [...] She said when the chance to portray Lexa presented itself, she was excited because {{of the quality of the}} show and its actors, and because the character allowed for a multifaceted dynamic; this resulted in Lexa being the character she has favored portraying thus far. [...] "Thankfully, (show creator) Jason , the creative team, the writers, and the hair and make-up are very collaborative," [...] Debnam-Carey said. [...] "They're really willing to create something. And that's what's so lucky about this show. It never started with expectation, so we've been able to embrace it and really make it our own, and that's been wonderful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} true enough; but I don't see that Downes was to blame, for until he came along {{he could not be}} sure where the lugger was, and indeed she was so close in under the cliff that it is like enough he would have missed her {{altogether}} and have gone on another two or three miles, {{if it had not been}} that they caught the noise of the boats alongside her taking in the kegs. The lugger got away all right; she is a fast craft, and though the Boxer can walk along in a strong wind, in a light breeze the lugger had the legs of her altogether. That shows you, Mr. Julian, that Captain Downes has cut his eye-teeth, and that it is mighty hard to fool him. He was never nearer making a good capture than he was that night. The lugger ran her cargo two nights afterwards at the very spot where the woman had told the revenue man that she was going to do it. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a fight, but the coast-guard were not strong enough to do any good, and had to make off, and before they could bring up anything like a strong force, every bale and keg had been carried inland, and before morning there was scarce a farmhouse within ten miles that had not got some of it stowed away in their snug hiding-places. Downes will be more vicious than ever after that job, and you see, master, you are like to run a goodish risk of getting your head broke and of being hauled off to jail. Still, if you would like to join some night in a run we can put you in the way." ...|$|E

6000|$|As he roamed about {{among the}} grounds this idea troubled him much. He assured {{himself that he}} was not in love with her himself, and that he had no idea of falling in love with her; but it sickened him to think that a girl who had been brought up by his aunt, who had been loved at Bragton, whom he had liked, who looked so like a lady, should put herself on a par with such a wretch as that. In all this he was most unjust to both of them. He was {{specially}} unjust to poor Larry, who was by no means a wretch. His costume was not that to which Morton had been accustomed in Germany, nor would it have passed without notice in Bond Street. But it was rational and clean. When he came to the bridge to meet his sweetheart he had on a dark-green shooting coat, a billicock hat, brown breeches, and gaiters nearly up to his knees. I don't know that a young man in the country could wear more suitable attire. And he was a well-made man,--just such a one as, in this dress, would take the eye of a country girl. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of dash about him,--just a touch of swagger,--which better breeding might have prevented. But it was not enough to make him odious to an unprejudiced observer. I could fancy that an old lady from London, with an eye in her head for manly symmetry, would have liked to look at Larry, and would have thought that a girl in Mary's position would be happy in having such a lover, providing that his character was good and his means adequate. But Reginald Morton was not an old woman, and to his eyes the smart young farmer with his billicock hat, not quite straight on his head, was an odious thing to behold. He exaggerated the swagger, and took no notice whatever of the well-made limbs. And then this man had proposed to accompany him, had wanted to join his party, had thought it possible that a flirtation might be carried on in his presence! He sincerely hated the man. But what was he to think of such a girl as Mary Masters when she could bring herself to like the attentions of such a lover? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But none {{to crush}} me as this will crush me. Well; what am I to do? Am I {{to go to}} prison--to-night?" [...] At this moment his {{daughter}} returned with a candle, and the mother could not make her answer at once. It was a wretched, poverty-stricken room. By degrees the carpet had disappeared, which had been laid down some nine or ten years since, when they had first come to Hogglestock, and which even then had not been new. Now nothing but a poor fragment of it remained {{in front of the}} fire-place. In {{the middle of the room}} there was a table which had once been large; but one flap of it was gone altogether, and the other flap sloped grievously towards the floor, the weakness of old age having fallen into its legs. There were two or three smaller tables about, but they stood propped against walls, thence obtaining a security which their own strength would not give them. At the further end of the room there was an ancient piece of furniture, which was always called [...] "papa's secretary," [...] at which Mr. Crawley customarily sat and wrote his sermons, and did all work that was done by him within his house. The man who had made it, some time in the last century, had intended it to be a locked guardian for domestic documents, and the receptacle for all that was most private in the house of some paterfamilias. But beneath the hands of Mr. Crawley it always stood open; and with the exception of the small space at which he wrote, was covered with dog's-eared books, from nearly all of which the covers had disappeared. There were there two odd volumes of Euripides, a Greek Testament, an Odyssey, a duodecimo Pindar, and a miniature Anacreon. There was half a Horace,--the two first books of the Odes at the beginning, and the De Arte Poetica at the end having disappeared. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a volume of Cicero, and there were Cæsar's Commentaries, in two volumes, so stoutly bound that they had defied the combined ill-usage of time and the Crawley family. All these were piled upon the secretary, with many others,--odd volumes of sermons and the like; but the Greek and Latin lay at the top, and showed signs of most frequent use. There was one arm-chair in the room,--a Windsor-chair, as such used to be called, made soft by an old cushion in the back, in which Mr. Crawley sat when both he and his wife were in the room, and Mrs. Crawley when he was absent. And there was an old horsehair sofa,--now almost denuded of its horsehair,--but that, like the tables, required the assistance of a friendly wall. Then there was half a dozen of other chairs,--all of different sorts,--and they completed the furniture of the room. It was not such a room as one would wish to see inhabited by a beneficed clergyman of the Church of England; but they who know what money will do and what it will not, will understand how easily a man with a family, and with a hundred and thirty pounds a year, may be brought to the need of inhabiting such a chamber. When it is remembered that three pounds of meat a day, at ninepence a pound, will cost over forty pounds a year, there need be no difficulty in understanding that it may be so. Bread for such a family must cost at least twenty-five pounds. Clothes for five persons, of whom one must at any rate wear the raiment of a gentleman, can hardly be found for less than ten pounds a year a head. Then there remains fifteen pounds for tea, sugar, beer, wages, education, amusements, and the like. In such circumstances a gentleman can hardly pay much for the renewal of his furniture! ...|$|E
6000|$|As some bells in {{a church}} hard by are making a great holiday clanging in the summer afternoon, I am {{reminded}} somehow of a July day, a garden, and a great clanging of bells years and years ago, {{on the very day}} when George IV. was crowned. I remember a little boy lying in that garden reading his first novel. It was called the [...] "Scottish Chiefs." [...] The little boy (who is now ancient and not little) read this book in the summer-house of his great grandmamma. She was eighty years of age then. A most lovely and picturesque old lady, with a long tortoise-shell cane, with a little puff, or tour, of snow-white (or was it powdered?) hair under her cap, with the prettiest little black-velvet slippers and high heels you ever saw. She had a grandson, a lieutenant in the navy; son of her son, a captain in the navy; grandson of her husband, a captain in the navy. She lived for scores and scores of years in a dear little old Hampshire town inhabited by the wives, widows, daughters of navy captains, admirals, lieutenants. Dear me! Don't I remember Mrs. Duval, widow of Admiral Duval; and the Miss Dennets, at the Great House {{at the other end of}} the town, Admiral Dennet's daughters; and the Miss Barrys, the late Captain Barry's daughters; and the good old Miss Maskews, Admiral Maskew's daughter; and that dear little Miss Norval, and the kind Miss Bookers, one of whom married Captain, now Admiral Sir Henry Excellent, K.C.B.? Far, far away into the past I look and see the little town with its friendly glimmer. That town was so like a novel of Miss Austen's that I wonder was she born and bred there? No, we should have known, and the good old ladies would have pronounced her to be a little idle thing, occupied with her silly books and neglecting her housekeeping. There were other towns in England, no doubt, where dwelt the widows and wives of other navy captains; where they tattled, loved each other, and quarrelled; talked about Betty the maid, and her fine ribbons indeed! took their dish of tea at six, played at quadrille every night till ten, when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of supper, after which Betty came with the lanthorn; and next day came, and next, and next, and so forth, until a day arrived when the lanthorn was out, when Betty came no more: all that little company sank to rest under the daisies, whither some folks will presently follow them. How did they live to be so old, those good people? Moi qui vous parle, I perfectly recollect old Mr. Gilbert, who had been to sea with Captain Cook; and Captain Cook, as you justly observe, dear Miss, quoting out of your [...] "Mangnall's Questions," [...] was murdered by the natives of Owhyhee, anno 1779. Ah! don't you remember his picture, standing on the seashore, in tights and gaiters, with a musket in his hand, pointing to his people not to fire from the boats, whilst a great tattooed savage is going to stab him in the back? Don't you remember those houris dancing before him and the other officers at the great Otaheite ball? Don't you know that Cook was at the siege of Quebec, with the glorious Wolfe, who fought under the Duke of Cumberland, whose royal father was a distinguished officer at Ramillies, before he commanded in chief at Dettingen? Huzza! Give it them, my lads! My horse is down? Then I know I shall not run away. Do the French run? then I die content. Stop. Wo! Quo me rapis? My Pegasus is galloping off, goodness knows where, like his Majesty's charger at Dettingen.|$|E
