5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, Portuguese sources tell of how <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> were summoned {{on the first}} and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously {{prostrate}} themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. <b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. <b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> were bothersome foreigners who sought {{to build their own}} trading post.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> Franciscans slowly started {{propagating}} Christianity in Mangalore. The {{most prominent}} local convert was the Brahmin mahant Shankarayya, who in 1751 travelled {{with his wife}} from Kallianpur to Goa and was baptised, with <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> viceroy assuming the role of his godfather. The honoured mahant took the name of Francisco de Távora, after the Viceroy Marques de Távora. Their properties were subsequently taken over by their Hindu relatives, but the viceroy instructed his factor of Mangalore to get their property restored. In 1534 Canara was placed under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the Bishop of Goa, where <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> had a strong presence. Missionaries soon arrived and gained converts. The number of local converts in South Canara continually increased until 1546. During the mid-16th century, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> faced resistance from Abbakka Rani of Ullal, the Queen of the Bednore dynasty. This put a halt to conversions. The first battle between Abbakka Rani and <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> was fought in 1546; she emerged victorious and drove <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> out of South Canara.|$|E

The embassy reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, granting <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> embassy a quick audience. However, further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> embassy was sent there to wait for the emperor's return.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invasion}} of Portugal by Napoleon's imperial army in 1807, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> Royal Court fled to Brazil, establishing the capital of <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> Monarchy and Empire in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves. The whole of <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> Monarchy became then the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. To reflect the change {{of the status of}} <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> Monarchy, the Prince Regent John (future King John VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (representing Brazil) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> flags.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E

While the artillery attacked the camp, the Germans moved their forces upstream and crossed the Rovuma safely out sight of Pinto and his men. <b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> did not resist von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces when they crossed the river and remained encamped at Ngomano.

5|$|At the time, the {{mainland}} south of Elephant Pass was {{claimed by the}} King of Kandy, Senerat; he and his troops were consistently harassing <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> in the Jaffna Peninsula. His wife's two sons, Vijayapala and Kumarasinghe, were also married to princesses from Jaffna. After the fall of Jaffna to <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese,</b> Senarat dispatched a 10,000 strong army to Jaffna {{under the command of}} Mudaliyar Attapattu. <b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> withdrew and the Kandyan army occupied Jaffna. <b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> General Constantino de Sá de Noronha later attacked with reinforcements from Colombo and defeated Mudaliyar Attapattu's army and seized Jaffna. According to Portuguese and Dutch publications, the last battle for Jaffna was fought between the King of Kandyan kingdom and <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese,</b> and the Europeans seized Jaffna from the Kandyan king. Following Portuguese defeat by the Dutch, the Jaffna Mannar islands and most of Jaffna's Vannimai lands had been reincoporated into the Tamil Coylot Wannees Country by the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> began to focus on expanding their African outposts.

Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> colony.|$|E

5|$|European {{influence}} in Mangalore {{can be traced}} back to 1498, when <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> explorer Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary's Islands near Mangalore. In the 16th century, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> came to acquire substantial commercial interests in Canara. Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the then ruler of the Vijaynagara empire maintained friendly relations with <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Portuguese</b> trade was gradually gathering momentum and they were striving to destroy the Arab and Moplah trade along the coast. In 1524, when Vasco da Gama heard that the Muslim merchants of Calicut had agents at Mangalore and Basrur, he ordered the rivers to be blockaded. In 1526, <b>the</b> <b>Portuguese</b> under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio took possession of Mangalore. The coastal trade passed out of Muslim hands into Portuguese hands. In 1550, the Vijayanagara ruler, Sadashiva Raya, entrusted the work of administering the coastal region of Canara to Sadashiv Nayaka of Keladi. By 1554, he was able to establish political authority over South Canara. The disintegration of the Vijaynagara Empire in 1565 gave the rulers of Keladi greater power in dealing with the coastal Canara region. They continued the Vijayanagara administrative system. The two provinces of Mangalore and Barkur continued to exist. The governor of Mangalore also acted as the governor of the Keladi army in his province. In 1695, the town was torched by Arabs in retaliation to Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade.|$|E
