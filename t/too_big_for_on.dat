50|$|In 1963, Tonga {{issued the}} world’s first {{self-adhesive}} stamps, an event which was celebrated by philatelists. The stamps were also circular {{in shape and}} printed on embossed gilt-foiled paper, thus matching {{the design of the}} coins being commemorated. Subsequent philatelic issues employed other off-beat designs - including stamps shaped like hearts, birds and fruit - and Tonga continued to issue self-adhesive stamps printed on paper. Although several of the stamps were <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> placement <b>on</b> conventional first-class mailing envelopes, Tonga’s unusual postage stamps have become popular with philatelists around the world.|$|R

60|$|I seem to {{remember}} very quick changes of mind after that lunch. The muzzy exaltation of the unaccustomed stimulants gave way very rapidly to a model of pellucid and impartial clairvoyance {{which is one of}} my habitual mental states. It is intermittent; it leaves me for weeks together, I know, but back it comes at last like justice on circuit, and calls up all my impression, all my illusions, all my willful and passionate proceedings. We came downstairs again into that inner room which pretended to be a scientific laboratory through its high glass lights, and indeed was a lurking place. My uncle pressed a cigarette on me, and I took it and stood before the empty fireplace while he propped his umbrella in the corner, deposited the new silk hat that was a little <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> him <b>on</b> the table, blew copiously and produced a second cigar.|$|R
40|$|I {{was pleased}} {{to be invited to}} review Douglas Harper’s Visual Sociology for Visual Methodologies as my {{research}} interests lay within the realms of the visual (Mannay 2010; 2013); moreover, being in the midst of writing my own text for Routledge, Visual, Narrative and Creative Research Methods: Application, Reflection and Ethics, it was also an opportunity to extend my background reading. On receiving my copy of the text, I was impressed with its size, it is a large book but, importantly, not <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> reading <b>on</b> the train. It is beautifully illustrated and it has large margins that remind me of Open University texts, which are great for scribbling notes; and my copy is now full of thoughts, reflections and ideas. Harper is an engaging writer and, like the images in his book, his words are able to connect with the reader and take them on a journey. There are eleven chapters that move through the expected themes of visual ethnography, the documentary tradition, reflexivity, ethnomethodology, semiotics, photo elicitation, photo-voice and techniques for teaching visual sociology. In the space of a short book review, I will only be able to engage with some of these chapters; but they were all worth reading and I gained new insights from each one...|$|R
50|$|On 2 December 1969 Mt Cook Airline {{introduced}} a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (ZK-CJZ), intended for scenic flights from Queenstown to Milford Sound and scheduled flights from Queenstown to Te Anau/Manapouri and Queenstown to Alexandra and Dunedin. The Twin Otter wasn't an economic success and was cancelled from 24 September 1973. A second Twin Otter (ZK-MCO) was purchased in November 1983 for services between Auckland, Kerikeri and Rotorua as the HS 748 was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> the loads <b>on</b> offer, but Mt Cook's Islander aircraft was too small. In 1988 this {{was transferred to}} Queenstown, ironically to operate scenic flights from Queenstown to Milford Sound and scheduled flights from Queenstown to Te Anau/Manapouri. A third was purchased in 1995 but both were disposed of in 1998 when Mt Cook Airlines light aircraft business was sold.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{orders were}} placed by the Royal Navy in 1940, and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving {{name to the}} class. In Canada, they were named for towns and cities, though they kept the same designation. Originally called a [...] "twin-screw corvette", the name [...] "frigate" [...] was {{suggested}} by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> the locks <b>on</b> the Lachine Canal {{so it was not}} built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In all, Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates, including ten for the Royal Navy, which transferred two to the United States Navy. Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN (four to a modified design).|$|R

[...] she asked as I {{approached}} her, startling me by something coarse in her cupidity almost as much as if she had not already given me a specimen of it. Juliana's desire to make our acquaintance lucrative had been, as I have sufficiently indicated, a false note in my image of the woman who had inspired a great poet with immortal lines; but I may say here definitely that I recognized after all that it behooved me to make a large allowance for her. It was I who had kindled the unholy flame; it was I who had put into her head that she had the means of making money. She appeared never to have thought of that; she had been living wastefully for years, in a house five times <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> her, <b>on</b> a footing that I could explain only by the presumption that, excessive as it was, the space she enjoyed cost her next to nothing and that small as were her revenues they left her, for Venice, an appreciable margin. I had descended on her one day and taught her to calculate, and my almost extravagant comedy {{on the subject of the}} garden had presented me irresistibly in the light of a victim. Like all persons who achieve the miracle of changing their point of view when they are old she had been intensely converted; she had seized my hint with a desperate, tremulous clutch.|$|R
