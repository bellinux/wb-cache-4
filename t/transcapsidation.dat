40|$|The {{acquisition}} of the defective SV 40 genome {{by a variety of}} human adenovirus serotypes by the process of <b>transcapsidation</b> has resulted in the addition of oncogenic potential for newborn hamsters to the previously nononcogenic adenovirus types 1, 2, 5, and 6. These serotypes have previously been grouped together by the high GC content of their DNA. <b>Transcapsidation</b> of the SV 40 genome to weakly oncogenic adenovirus types 3, 14, 16, and 21 has failed to increase their oncogenic potential although the parent adenovirus type 7 carrying PARA is highly oncogenic. These serotypes belong to the group possessing a DNA of intermediate GC content. All the PARA-adenovirus populations, even those that were nononcogenic, were able to induce SV 40 transplantation immunity and therefore carry the SV 40 transplantation marker as well as the marker for synthesis of SV 40 tumor or T antigen...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{properties of}} a human adenovims that has incorporated defective SV 40 genetic material within its adenocapsid have been extensively studied (1, 2). The particle containing the defective SV 40 genome is known as PARA (2). Its presence confers new properties on the adenovirus population which now replicates in simian cells (3), carries the genetic information for the synthesis of SV 40 tumor (T) antigen (4, 5) and SV 40 specific transplantation antigens (6), and is oncogenic in newborn hamsters (1, 7). Genetic material from PARA can be transferred to other human adenovimses by a process called <b>transcapsidation</b> (8, 9). As {{a result of such}} transfer to type 2, this previously nononcogenic adenovirus produced tumors when injected into newborn hamsters (7, 10). These tumors were characteristic of either SV 40 -induced tumors, adenovirus-like tumors, or contained elements of both types. Hamster cells transformed in vitro by PARA-adenovirus 2 yielded similar tumors when inoculated into weanling hamsters (11). The PARA component has also been transferred to seven other huma...|$|E
40|$|The {{adenovirus}} (adeno) -SV 40 hybrid viruses offer {{a unique}} opportunity to study the phenomenon of transformation induced by both the adenoviruses and SV 40. In a previous report, transformation of hamster and human tissue culture cells with the adeno 7 -SV 40 hybrid virus was described (1). Although the transformation which resulted was characteristic of SV 40, there was some evidence, from serologic studies, that a portion of the adenovirus genome was operative in the transformed cell as well (2). More recently, other adeno-SV 40 hybrids have been recovered from various passage lines used for vaccine production (3) or have been formed with both the nononcogenic and oncogenic adenoviruses by <b>transcapsidation</b> procedures (4, 5). The existence of these hybrid viruses has raised questions regarding the amount and physical state of the SV 40 DNA contained within the hybrid particle. Rowe and Pugh (6) and Baum et al. (7) have shown that the SV 40 and adeno 7 DNA's are physically linked in the adeno 7 -SV 40 hybrid virus, and that a portion of the adeno 7 DNA accompanies the SV 40 DNA when the latter genom...|$|E
40|$|For all {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) serotypes, 60 {{monomers}} of the Vp 1, Vp 2, and Vp 3 structural proteins assemble via an unknown mechanism {{to form an}} intact capsid. In an effort {{to better understand the}} properties of the capsid monomers and their role in viral entry and infection, we evaluated whether monomers from distinct serotypes can be mixed to form infectious particles with unique phenotypes. This <b>transcapsidation</b> approach consisted of the transfection of pairwise combinations of AAV serotype 1 to 5 helper plasmids to produce mosaic capsid recombinant AAV (rAAV). All ratios (19 : 1, 3 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 3, and 1 : 19) of these mixtures were able to replicate the green fluorescent protein transgene and to produce capsid proteins. A high-titer rAAV was obtained with mixtures that included either serotype 1, 2, or 3, whereas an rAAV of intermediate titer was obtained from serotype 5 mixtures. Only mixtures containing the AAV 4 capsid exhibited reduced packaging capacity. The binding profiles of the mixed-virus preparations to either heparin sulfate (HS) or mucin agarose revealed that only AAV 3 -AAV 5 mixtures at the 3 : 1 ratio exhibited duality in binding. All other mixtures displayed either an abrupt shift or a gradual alteration in the binding profile to the respective ligand upon increase of a capsid component that conferred either HS or mucin binding. The transduction of cell lines was used to further evaluate the phenotypes of these transcapsidated virions. Three transduction profiles were observed: (i) small to no change regardless of ratio, (ii) a gradual increase in transduction consistent wit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRotavirus (RV) cores were {{released}} from double-layered particles (DLPs) by {{high concentrations of}} CaCl 2, purified and ‘opened’ by treatment with EDTA or EGTA. Under appropriate in vitro conditions DLPs {{have been shown to}} have transcriptase and ‘open cores’ replicase activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that transcriptase activity and infectivity of native cores can be restored by <b>transcapsidation</b> with VP 6, VP 7 and VP 4. The missing link for particle reconstitution in vitro has been the manipulation of ‘open cores’ to become functionally active cores again. The experiments described here were undertaken with the aim of exploring packaging of RV RNAs into opened cores in vitro. Rotavirus cores were opened by approximately 200 μM EGTA, leading to the release of genomic dsRNA. Conversely, RV cores were found to be stable in the presence of minimum concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, spermidine 3 + and cobalthexamine 3 + of between 40 and 300 μM. Aggregates of purified cores were resolved in the presence of 0. 3 mM deoxycholate (minimum concentration). Core shells opened with EGTA were reconstituted by the addition of di- or trivalent cations within 2 min of the opening procedure. Addition of purified, baculovirus recombinant-expressed VP 6 to native and reconstituted cores {{led to the formation of}} DLPs or DLP-like particles, which upon transfection into MA 104 cells were infectious. The rescued infectivity likely originated in part from unopened and in part from reconstituted cores. Radiolabelled RV (+) ssRNAs could be packaged into reconstituted cores and DLPs, as indicated by resistance to RNase I digestion. The packaging reaction was, however, not RV RNA sequence-specific, since unrelated ssRNAs, such as those transcribed from HIV- 2 cDNAs, were also packaged. The kinetics of packaging of homologous and heterologous RNAs were similar, as evidenced by competitive packaging assays. None of the packaged in vitro engineered RNA segments has so far been rescued into infectious virus...|$|E
