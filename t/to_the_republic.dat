5|$|The {{official}} {{recognition of}} the Armenian Genocide by the US federal government is seen {{one of the most}} vital steps in international and full {{recognition of the}} 1915–1923 events.

After holding a series of senior posts in the New Zealand Army, including a period as its commander, he was appointed Chief of the Defence Staff in 1965 for a six-year term.

5|$|In October 1962, South Kasai {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> of the Congo. The State of Katanga {{continued to}} hold out against the central government until it too collapsed in January 1963 after UN forces began {{to take a more}} aggressive stance under Thant. As a compromise, South Kasai was one of the 21 provinces formally established by the federalist constitution of 1962. As the Mobutu regime launched a centralist restructuring of the Congolese state from 1965, South Kasai {{was one of the few}} provinces which was retained. In order to discourage further secessionist sentiment, the province was later restructured to include new territory in Kabinda and Sankuru Districts and renamed Eastern Kasai (Kasaï-Oriental).|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, who {{suffered}} from the disruption in trade. Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic.</b> With {{the end of the war}} between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E
5|$|Jelena married Đurađ II Balšić in 1386 or 1387. After this {{marriage}} the suzerainty of Lazar of Serbia was accepted in most {{if not all}} of Zeta. When the Sultan sent an army to invade the lands of Đurađ II at the beginning of 1392, Jelena travelled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> of Ragusa (nowadays Dubrovnik) to get out of harm's way. On 1 June 1392, the senate of Dubrovnik decided to send a galley {{to take her to the}} city. Đurađ was captured by the Ottomans in October 1392 and was released only once he agreed to cede Scutari to them. He managed to recapture the town in 1395 but subsequently sold it to the Venetians, together with the surrounding fortresses.|$|E

5|$|No formal {{coursing}} {{has taken}} place in Northern Ireland since 2002, as Ministers have refused the coursing clubs permission to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act and in June 2010 the Northern Ireland Assembly voted to ban the practice. The two extant Northern Ireland coursing clubs since 2002 have travelled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> to hold meetings jointly with coursing clubs there. Opinion polls commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports as part of its campaigning have shown very strong public opposition to hare coursing from both urban and rural residents of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{threatening}} features of the new North Vietnamese build-up was the air defence network that was established within South Vietnam, which by 1975 consisted of twenty-two regiments equipped with radar-controlled gun systems and formidable SA-2 Guideline and shoulder-launched SA-7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles. Such systems posed a major deterrent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were not {{equipped to deal with}} such threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum. This lack of active intelligence collection made estimation of North Vietnamese strength and intentions much more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Pope Gregory IX's {{crusade against}} the Bogumils in Bosnia, who were deemed heretics, {{did not bring}} good results. Central Bosnia was not conquered, and Bosnian Ban Matej Ninoslav and his nobility retreated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> of Ragusa in 1240. In an edict issued by Ninoslav on 22 March 1240, Ninoslav promised to protect the city of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) if Vladislav attacked. At the time, Serbian bands roamed around the outside of Dubrovnik, and Vladislav himself {{was a member of}} the bands. The Ragusans may have feared Vladislav due to the earlier {{disputes}} with him, or Vladislav may have posed an actual danger to Ragusa.|$|E
