40|$|This is {{a public}} comment on the above cited {{solicitation}} (RFI) [1] related to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). It is sent jointly by the Internet Architectecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Clarification of <b>technical</b> <b>parameter</b> assignment function. Specifically, the "technical parameters " portion of the IANA RFI [2] describes the management of parameters defined by IETF standards. As part of its standards specification process, each new parameter type definition includes a specification of the method of allocation of parameter values, as well as provision for appropriate technical review and acceptance. Where specific expertise {{will be required to}} evaluate any request, the IETF provides a "designated expert " to support the allocation function. These specifications are developed in the IETF's usual international, open, consensus-based e-mail discussion venues. Dispute resolution, when needed, occurs within the IETF organization. There is a factual error in the RFI's description of the current <b>technical</b> <b>parameter</b> assignment function. It incorrectly associates "reservation and direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast addressing, addresses for private networks, and globally specified applications " with the IP address management function. These allocations are in fact standards-based allocations developed and controlled by the IETF. IANA’s function is to record these allocations. We also point out a similar omission from the RFI's description of the <b>technical</b> <b>parameter</b> assignment function. It fail...|$|E

40|$|Wendelstein 7 -X is {{designed}} to be a steady state experiment. One discharge may last up to 30 min and will be divided into many segments (elementary experimental program parts). Physics programs need to be pre-planned and <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> need to be adjusted in the long run. The <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> are a complete set of parameters for all participating components, which describe their behavior within a segment. To enable the diagnosticians to focus on physical experiment parameters only, an abstraction layer above the <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> has been developed, the so-called high level parameters. The high level parameters specify a subset of the <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> on a physics level and are therefore used to hide technical details. During ordinary program planning, the diagnosticians only see and work with these physics parameters. Having finished editing, the high level parameters will be mapped by a user defined transformation function onto <b>technical</b> <b>parameters.</b> For all <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> which are not defined by the high level parameters, the default values will be taken from one particular predefined pattern. Hence a complete segment is defined by a set of high level parameters including a pattern. In comparison to shot-based and other existing experiments, this is an entirely new, scientifically oriented approach to plan experiments. The motivation and concept of the high level parameters will be discussed. The successful implementation of this concept at the W 7 -X CoDaC prototype – the small stellarator experiment WEGA – will be presented...|$|R
