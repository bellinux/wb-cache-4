[...] He died on May 10, 1849 (18th day of the 4th month of the 2nd year of the Kaei era by the old calendar), and was buried at the Seikyō-ji in Tokyo (Taito Ward).|$|E
2500|$|McCartney's initial {{concern was}} that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work (known as cryptomnesia). As he put it, [...] "For about a month I went round to people in the music {{business}} and asked them whether they had ever heard it before. Eventually it became like handing something in to the police. I thought if no one claimed it after a few weeks <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{publication}} of The Satanic Verses, the publisher received [...] "warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant" [...] that the book might be controversial. Later, Rushdie would reflect upon {{the time that the}} book was about to be published. Speaking to an interviewer, he said, [...] "I expected a few mullahs would be offended, call me names, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> defend myself in public... I honestly never expected anything like this".|$|E
2500|$|The Board of Welfare {{was willing}} to pay for his regular {{expenses}} but not for private vacations in the country. Private charitable organizations, on several occasions, made it possible for him to convalesce in the country after illness and several friends turned over cottages in the mountains or the seaside. But such experiences were infrequent and year sometimes followed year before he was {{able to get out of}} the city again. In 1958 he wrote, “I long to return to Nature, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> paint again.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, two youths {{attempted}} {{to break into}} a Croydon warehouse: one, Derek Bentley, surrendered to the police but the other, Christopher Craig, shot and killed a police officer. Yet at the trial Bentley was sentenced to death. [...] "My mum knew the Bentleys," [...] McTell recalls. [...] "I was about eight, but even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the horror and injustice of executing a teenager for a murder he didn't commit." [...] Many years later, McTell expressed that sense of injustice in the song [...] "Bentley & Craig".|$|E

Meanwhile, those school students spend several million yen, and four years, yet they are good for nothing." [...] and that, [...] "For instance, Keiko Takemiya, the then professor of Seika Univ., remarked in the Government Council that 'A complete novice {{will be able to}} understand where is [...] "Tachikiri" [...] (i.e., margin section) during four years.' On the other hand, I would imagine that, It takes about thirty minutes to completely understand that at work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Buck decided to reduce his {{schedule}} to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, [...] "I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forget I've got all the other stuff." [...] In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it easier {{for you to go}} and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Takahashi {{said that}} she had been dreaming about the overall {{universe}} of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series [...] "really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write any way I wanted to". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150 square feet apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet {{due to a lack of}} space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series.|$|E

2500|$|Frank Zappa, who {{had been}} {{interested}} in film since high school, decided to develop a film vehicle for the Mothers of Invention, entitled Uncle Meat. The proposed film would combine elements of science fiction and road stories inspired by the band's sexual escapades. Subsequently, Zappa began working on a project called No Commercial Potential, which eventually became the albums We're Only in It for the Money, Lumpy Gravy, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat. Zappa stated, [...] "It's all one album. All the material in the albums is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense.

2500|$|Rik Van Steenbergen said: [...] "When I turned pro, I couldn't ride it {{straight}} away. There were {{three categories of}} rider: road-riders A, road-riders B, and track riders. I was registered with the federation as a track rider. At first they wouldn't let me ride the national championship. But Jean van Buggenhout, the manager, got me reclassified on the Wednesday before the race. I won it and became an 'A' rider. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> start {{the year in the}} Tour of Flanders. I was 19 and I'll probably stay the youngest person ever to win." [...] Van Steenbergen was in the break when several riders fell on the cinder track to the track in Ghent. Van Steenbergen rode round the fallen and won. Next year he decided not to ride. Van Wijnendaele was offended. But Van Steenbergen had realised why he'd turned pro: to make a living. [...] "I could probably win more money elsewhere," [...] he said. [...] "The Tour of Flanders didn't have the attraction that it does now, especially not internationally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jacob Brackman {{introduced}} fellow producer Bert Schneider to Terrence Malick in 1975. On {{a trip to}} Cuba, Schneider and Malick began {{conversations that}} would lead to the development of Days of Heaven. Malick had tried and failed to get Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino to star in the film. Schneider agreed to produce the film. He and Malick cast young actors Richard Gere and Brooke Adams and actor/playwright Sam Shepard for the lead roles. Paramount Pictures CEO at the time Barry Diller wanted Schneider to produce films for him and agreed to finance Days of Heaven. At the time, the studio was heading in a new direction. They were hiring new production heads who had worked in network television, and, according to former production chief Richard Sylbert, [...] " [...] product aimed at your knees". Despite the change in direction, Schneider was able to secure a deal with Paramount by guaranteeing the budget and taking personal responsibility for all overages. [...] "Those were the kind of deals I liked to make ... because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have final cut and not talk to nobody about why we're gonna use this person instead of that person", Schneider said.|$|E
2500|$|She {{stated in}} 2007, [...] "I don't {{understand}} why women {{feel the need}} to go into acting as soon as they become famous ... But I suppose if the part were aesthetically correct, <b>then</b> maybe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> consider it." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1950, Goldsmith {{found work}} at CBS {{as a clerk}} typist in the network's music {{department}} under director Lud Gluskin. There he began writing scores for such radio shows as CBS Radio Workshop, Frontier Gentleman, and Romance. [...] In an interview with Andy Velez from BarnesandNoble.com, Goldsmith stated, [...] "It was about 1950. CBS had a workshop, and once a week the employees, whatever their talents, whether they were ushers or typists, would produce a radio show. But {{you had to be}} an employee. They needed someone to do music, and I knew someone there who said I'd be great for this. I'd just gotten married and needed a job, so they faked a typing test for me. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do these shows. About six months later, the music department heard what I did, liked it, and gave me a job." [...] He later progressed into scoring such live CBS television shows as Climax! and Playhouse 90. [...] He also scored multiple episodes of the television series The Twilight Zone. He remained at CBS until 1960, after which he moved on to Revue Studios and then to MGM Studios for producer Norman Felton, whom he had worked for during live television and would later compose music for such television shows as Dr. Kildare and The Man from U.N.C.L.E..|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Jack Buck decided to reduce his {{schedule}} to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence).

Buck once joked, [...] "I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forget I've got all the other stuff." [...] In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: [...] "I don't know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!" [...] Jack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis's Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a combination of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has tried}} the mixture between flamenco and [...] {{classical}} music in works like Fantasía de cante jondo para voz y orquesta (Cante jondo Fantasy for voice and orchestra, together with pianist Antonio Robledo, guitarists Juan Habichuela and Gerardo Núñez and the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Luis Izquierdo, 1986) or with Allegro Soleá, which he presented at Seville's Flamenco Biennal in 1990. Along {{the lines of}} the mixture of flamenco with other types of music, he collaborated in the show Macama Jonda by José Heredia Maya, together with the Tetuan Andalusian Orchestra and Abdessadeq Cheqara, or with the Bulgarian Voices choir Angelite. In Morente's aforementioned recording Omega, [...] he mixed flamenco singing with punk rock, music by Leonard Cohen, and lyrics by Federico García Lorca. In the show África-Cuba-Cai he mixed flamenco with music from Senegal, and Cuba (Cai is the way Cádiz is pronounced in Andalusian Spanish). The show also underlines the historic links between Cuban and flamenco music: [...] "That's always been close to flamenco, since way back, because the ships in Cádiz went to Cuba, some came and others stayed over there, we've always had that." [...] It is difficult to think of any kind of music which has not interested Morente. After one of his concerts with Cheqara Orkesta of Tetuan, he declared: [...] "…if I had to put out a CD for every culture I mixed with I'd be putting out about 7 or 8 CDs a year. It wouldn't be bad – if I got paid for it by the record company <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> build myself a home." ...|$|E
