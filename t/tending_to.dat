5|$|In applied mathematics, as we {{have done}} here, the delta {{function}} is often manipulated {{as a kind of}} limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> zero.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{well-developed}} {{social structure}} within {{large groups of}} condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations. Generally, mature males tend {{to be at the}} top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> be near the bottom.|$|E
5|$|This mirrors {{tropical}} cyclone genesis near these features, as genesis clusters in 2–3weeks of activity followed by 2–3weeks of inactivity. Tropical cyclones can form in outbreaks around these features under special circumstances, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> follow the next cyclone to its poleward and west.|$|E

5|$|An ultranationalist Mi-24 Hind {{helicopter}} destroys a vital {{bridge and}} traps the joint force. In the ensuing fight, a tanker explodes, {{and many of}} the group are either killed or injured. Zakhaev himself arrives and begins killing wounded soldiers when loyalists in a Mi-28 Havoc suddenly destroy his Mi-24 Hind and join the fray. Distracted, Zakhaev turns to the Loyalist forces at which point Price gives Soap a M1911; the latter kills Zakhaev and his escort. Loyalist forces start <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> the wounded immediately.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|For {{two more}} years, Tubman {{worked for the}} Union forces, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> newly liberated slaves, {{scouting}} into Confederate territory, and nursing wounded soldiers in Virginia. She also made periodic trips back to Auburn, to visit her family and care for her parents. The Confederacy surrendered in April 1865; after donating several more months of service, Tubman headed home to Auburn, New York.|$|E

5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|In many ways, {{life for}} peasants in the {{countryside}} during the Song dynasty was similar to those living in previous dynasties. The people spent their days ploughing and planting in the fields, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> their families, selling crops and goods at local markets, visiting local temples, and arranging ceremonies such as marriages. Cases of banditry, which local officials were forced to combat, occurred constantly {{in the countryside}}.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1921, Howe was vacationing {{with the}} Roosevelts at Campobello Island when Franklin {{began to run}} a high fever and {{reported}} paralysis in his legs. A doctor was sent for, and Roosevelt was diagnosed with poliomyelitis. Howe remained by Roosevelt's bedside throughout {{the early days of}} his illness, cheering him up, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> his needs, and even changing his bedpans. By September of that year, Howe had been formally invited to join the Roosevelt household, and began visiting his own family only on weekends.|$|E

The leaves of Charming pulchellum <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be very fragile and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be larger in size {{when compared to}} other sub-species.

5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> the lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> infinity.|$|E

In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded by the introduction of the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E

The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, {{similar to that of}} its predecessor, Theme Park. Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} the vulcanoid zone is very small {{compared}} to that of the asteroid belt. Collisions between objects in the vulcanoid zone would be frequent and highly energetic, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> lead to the destruction of the objects. The most favourable location for vulcanoids is probably in circular orbits near {{the outer edge of the}} vulcanoid zone. Vulcanoids are unlikely to have inclinations of more than about 10° to the ecliptic. Mercury trojans, asteroids trapped in Mercury's Lagrange points, are also possible.|$|E
