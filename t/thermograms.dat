There are two stages of degradation in these four polymers. The first stage is the loss of hydrogen chloride, and is complete around 250 °C. This first step occurs at lower temperatures for the polymers containing more chlorine (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated rubber, and polyvinylidene chloride), implying that these chloride groupings are less stable than in polyvinyl chloride.|$|E

The PMMA differential <b>thermogram</b> showed two decomposition peaks at 300 and 394  °C. Above 430  °C, all the PMMA was completely decomposed. The <b>thermogram</b> for NaMMT showed a two-step degradation process, at 90  °C, due to loss of adsorbed water, and at 500  °C due to dehydroxylation of the clay structure (Binithat and Sugunan 2006; Qin et al. 2015). The peak at 345  °C in the differential <b>thermogram</b> for PMMAgMMT (Fig.  1 d was ascribed to the decomposition of grafted PMMA since the NaMMT differential <b>thermogram</b> did not show a similar peak. The grafting efficiency was estimated from the mass loss at the temperature of 345  °C. This indicated PMMAgMMT contained about 9.0  % by mass of PMMA.|$|R

50|$|Thermal images, or <b>thermograms,</b> are {{actually}} visual displays {{of the amount}} of infrared energy emitted, transmitted, and reflected by an object. Because there are multiple sources of the infrared energy, it is difficult to get an accurate temperature of an object using this method. A thermal imaging camera is capable of performing algorithms to interpret that data and build an image. Although the image shows the viewer an approximation of the temperature at which the object is operating, the camera is actually using multiple sources of data based on the areas surrounding the object to determine that value rather than detecting the actual temperature.|$|E

Among various preparation methods, the ‘‘hot-water” method offers a simple procedure to prepare DODAB cationic vesicles by simply dissolving the DODAB {{in hot water}} above 50 °C, i.e., chain melting (main) transition, Tm.In general, the DSC <b>thermograms</b> of the unsonicated DODAB dispersions are dominated by two endotherms; the pre- (35-36 °C) and main transition (42.7-45 °C) peaks. Moreover, in literature reported {{the presence of a}} thirdendotherm (post transition) at 52.2 °C.The main transition (Tm) is ascribed to gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition in which the alkyl chains transform from solidlike to liquid-like state.|$|E
50|$|Combustion during TG {{analysis}} is identifiable by distinct traces {{made in the}} TGA <b>thermograms</b> produced. One interesting example occurs with samples of as-produced unpurified carbon nanotubes that have {{a large amount of}} metal catalyst present. Due to combustion, a TGA trace can deviate from the normal form of a well-behaved function. This phenomenon arises from a rapid temperature change. When the weight and temperature are plotted versus time, a dramatic slope change in the first derivative plot is concurrent with the mass loss of the sample and the sudden increase in temperature seen by the thermocouple. The mass loss could be the result of particles of smoke released from burning caused by inconsistencies in the material itself, beyond the oxidation of carbon due to poorly controlled weight loss.|$|E

50|$|Infrared {{thermography}} (IRT), thermal imaging, {{and thermal}} video {{are examples of}} infrared imaging science. Thermographic cameras usually detect radiation in the long-infrared range {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} (roughly 9,000-14,000 nanometers or 9-14 µm) and produce images of that radiation, called <b>thermograms.</b> Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to see one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature; therefore, thermography allows one to see variations in temperature. When viewed through a thermal imaging camera, warm objects stand out well against cooler backgrounds; humans and other warm-blooded animals become easily visible against the environment, day or night. As a result, thermography is particularly useful to the military and other users of surveillance cameras.|$|E
50|$|Night vision {{infrared}} devices {{image in}} the near-infrared, just beyond the visual spectrum, and can see emitted or reflected near-infrared in complete visual darkness. All objects above the absolute zero temperature (0 K) emit infrared radiation. Hence, {{an excellent way to}} measure thermal variations is to use an infrared vision device, usually a focal plane array (FPA) infrared camera capable of detecting radiation in the mid (3 to 5 µm) and long (7 to 14 µm) wave infrared bands, denoted as MWIR and LWIR, corresponding to two of the high transmittance infrared windows. Abnormal temperature profiles at the surface of an object are an indication of a potential problem.Infrared thermography, thermal imaging, and thermal video, are examples of infrared imaging science. Thermal imaging cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900-14,000 nanometers or 0.9-14 µm) and produce images of that radiation, called <b>thermograms.</b>|$|E

Methods: A total of 23 patients with acute facial neuritis were enrolled from Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Chinese PLA General Hospital. Another 21 healthy participants were selected as the control group. Focal plane thermal imaging system (thermal sensitivity 0. 05 ℃) was applied to collect facial far-infrared <b>thermogram.</b> Temperature differences in the <b>thermogram</b> of {{both sides of the}} cheeks, inner canthus, supraorbitals and forehead of the same patient were compared separately and statistically and analyzed by software provided by the imaging system. Results: Results of far-infrared thermography of the patients displayed obvious temperature differences ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 26 ℃ between two sides of the cheeks, inner canthus, supraorbitals and forehead areas. In the control group, far-infrared <b>thermogram</b> showed that there were no obvious temperature differences between two sides of the cheeks, inner canthus, supraorbitals and forehead. There were significant differences in temperature difference in the four monitoring areas between the two groups (P< 0. 01). Among the 23 patients, there were 14 patients with congestive change, 7 with ischemic change and 2 with both congestive and ischemic changes. Conclusion: The facial far-infrared <b>thermogram</b> of patients with acute facial neuritis is characterized mainly by congestive changes.

Additionally, we evaluated the heterogeneity of <b>thermograms</b> along age, sex, ethnicity, concurrent health conditions and SLE diagnostic criteria. <b>Thermograms</b> were visualized graphically for important differences between covariates and summarized using various measures.

40|$|Infrared {{thermography}} (IRT) is {{a method}} to read the temperature behavior of an inspected object by using a thermal camera [1]. IRT has attracted much attention over other nondestructive evaluation techniques due to its contactless and remote nature, {{it is easy to}} interpret the thermal data from the camera, and it is free from any dangerous radiation to the thermographer. Compared to other temperature measurement devices, such as the thermocouple, a thermal camera has a wide coverage area of inspection.

The two-step decomposition {{process of the}} blend nanoparticles is clearly illustrated. The peak temperature of the DTG thermogram is the temperature of maximum decomposition rate ([...] Td, max).

At the same time, <b>thermograms</b> of this sort occur universally in infrared imaging applications. They can be obtained both from inhomogeneous media or processes and from living objects. In [1] it is shown that heterogeneous <b>thermograms</b> displayed by human organism with disturbed inner equilibrium can be analyzed in terms of statistical parameters of related surface-temperature histograms, such as the mean temperature and standard deviation of temperature.

40|$|Abstract Background Mathematical {{modelling}} {{and analysis}} is now {{accepted in the}} engineering design on par with experimental approaches. Computer simulations enable one to perform several 'what-if' analyses cost effectively. High speed computers and low cost of memory has helped in simulating large-scale models in a relatively shorter time frame. The possibility of extending numerical modelling {{in the area of}} breast cancer detection in conjunction with medical thermography is considered in this work. Methods Thermography enables one to see the temperature pattern and look for abnormality. In a <b>thermogram</b> there is no radiation risk as it only captures the infrared radiation from the skin and is totally painless. But, a <b>thermogram</b> is only a test of physiology, whereas a mammogram is a test of anatomy. It is hoped that a <b>thermogram</b> along with numerical modelling will serve as an adjunct tool. Presently mammogram is the 'gold-standard' in breast cancer detection. But the interpretation of a mammogram is largely dependent on the radiologist. Therefore, a <b>thermogram</b> that looks into the physiological changes in combination with numerical simulation performing 'what-if' analysis could act as an adjunct tool to mammography. Results The proposed framework suggested that it could reduce the occurrence of false-negative/positive cases. Conclusion A numerical bioheat model of a female breast is developed and simulated. The results are compared with experimental results. The possibility of this method as an early detection tool is discussed. </p...|$|R
