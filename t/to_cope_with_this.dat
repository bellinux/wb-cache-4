5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested {{as a solution to}} provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{additional}} workload, Hergé {{approached a}} friend {{whom he had}} met through Van Melkebeke, Edgar P. Jacobs, to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist. Jacobs could only work on the project part time, and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous Adventures of Tintin into 62-page colour versions.|$|E

As a contribution <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem {{the thesis proposes}} an architecture for a fully automated dynamic detection and healing of data races and atomicity violations in Java. Two distinct algorithms for detecting of data races are presented. One {{of them is a}} novel algorithm called AtomRace which detects data races as a special case of atomicity violations. The healing is based on suppressing a recurrence of the detected problem and can be performed by introducing an additional synchronization or by legally influencing the Java scheduler. Basically forces certain parts of the code  to be executed atomically. The proposed architecture uses bytecode instrumentation to be able to track and influence the execution. The architecture and algorithms were implemented and tested on multiple case studies...|$|R

All three stations discharge water to the Hatfield Waste Drain. The Internal Drainage Boards also had to upgrade some of their pumps to cope with the extra volumes of water.|$|E
25|$|To survive, {{selected}} microorganisms {{can assume}} forms that {{enable them to}} withstand freezing, complete desiccation, starvation, high levels of radiation exposure, and other physical or chemical challenges. These microorganisms may survive exposure to such conditions for weeks, months, years, or even centuries. Extremophiles are microbial life forms that thrive outside the ranges where life is commonly found. They excel at exploiting uncommon sources of energy.

In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above O'Connell Street in Dublin on Saint Patrick's Day; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. <b>To</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> a new £10 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972.

40|$|Salinity is {{a common}} abiotic stress causing soybean yield loss worldwide. Use of {{tolerant}} cultivars is an effective and economic approach <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> stress.

The objectives of this study were to identify salt-tolerant genotypes, to search for SNPs and QTLs associated with salt tolerance, and to identify candidate salt tolerance genes. A total of 192 diverse soybean lines and cultivars were screened for salt tolerance in the greenhouse based on visual leaf scorch scores after 15 - 18 days of 120 ml NaCl stress, among which 94 were tolerant while 87 were sensitive. These genotypes were further genotyped using the SoySNP 50 K iSelect BeadChip with 52, 041 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, among which 37, 281 SNPs were polymorphic with minor allele frequency (MAF) 3 ̆e 5...|$|R

25|$|During the Spanish {{colonial rule}} within 1565 to 1898, Filipinos {{never failed to}} find a way <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> regime. During the {{colonization}} of Spain, Christianity heavily influenced the lives of Filipinos which lead to religious pieces and performances throughout the country. The most important group of plays influenced by Spain is called komedya which varies between two themes: the secular and the religious. For example, a play called Tibag which talks about the search of Elena and Constantino for the Cross of Christ is still performed in some towns. Although this religious play is still performed, the most important religious piece to this day is called the sinakulo or commonly called the passion of Christ which is usually performed during the Lenten season.|$|E
25|$|While {{opposed to}} {{interfaith}} marriage in principle, {{officials of the}} major Reform rabbinical organisation, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), estimated in 2012 {{that about half of}} their rabbis partake in such ceremonies. The need <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon – 80% of all Reform-raised Jews in the United States wed between 2000 and 2013 were intermarried – led to the recognition of patrilineal descent: all children born to a couple in which a single member was Jewish, whether mother or father, was accepted as a Jew on condition that they received corresponding education and committed themselves as such. Conversely, offspring of a Jewish mother only are not accepted if they do not demonstrate affinity to the faith. A Jewish status is conferred unconditionally only on the children of two Jewish parents.|$|E

25|$|Dosage {{compensation}} {{is the process}} by which organisms equalize the expression of genes between members of different biological sexes. Across species, different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes. In order to account for varying numbers of sex chromosomes, different organisms have acquired unique methods to equalize gene expression amongst the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes, different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> inequality. Replicating the actual gene is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the expression from each gene. For example, in humans, females (XX) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.|$|E
25|$|Failure {{to secure}} the {{population}} meant that the VC were able to tighten their grip- drawing a continual supply of recruits, food, intelligence, shelter and other resources to maintain their insurgency. The American concept of leaving the relatively ineffective ARVN <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> key other war, a task they had often failed at in several years prior to US intervention, played into the NLF's hands. In many cases where the population was separated from the insurgents via forced relocations, destruction of villages or generation of refugees, conditions still remained insecure, undermining GVN/US attempts at both pacification and attrition. Impressive as they seemed, big American or GVN sweeps inevitably moved on, failing to 'hold' an area and its population. Once their opponents had gone, the VC and NVA were able to return and resume business. This pattern is reflected even {{in the aftermath of}} the Tet attacks. They hurt the Viet Cong badly in military terms, and northern-born personnel were to increasingly dominate the Main-Force VC formations. However the critical population control and infrastructure effort continued, and the VC were still able to muster about 85,000 fresh recruits annually.|$|E
