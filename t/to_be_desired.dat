Karnataka has also established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care than most other states of India.

5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that the {{handling}} of armoured forces during the campaign left much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> During the beginning of Guderian's attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian's armour was fully unleashed. There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany's armour, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany's armored strength.|$|E
5|$|The initial French {{attack was}} aimed at seizing the three Russian {{positions}} collectively known as the Bagration flèches, four arrow-head shaped, open-backed earthworks which arced out to the left en échelon {{in front of the}} Kolocha stream. These positions helped support the Russian left, which had no terrain advantages. There was much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> {{in the construction of the}} flèches, one officer noting that the ditches were much too shallow, the embrasures open to the ground, making them easy to enter, and that they were much too wide exposing infantry inside them. The flèches were supported by artillery from the village of Semyanovskaya, whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E

25|$|Quality {{of service}} also leaves much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> The 2000 census {{indicated}} that 55% of Mexican households {{with access to}} piped water received services on an intermittent basis, in particular in smaller municipalities and poor areas. About 36% of wastewater was being treated in 2006, a share {{that is more than}} twice as high as the average for Latin America. However, an unknown share of Mexican treatment plants do not comply with norms for effluent discharge.|$|E

25|$|The C.200 was {{designed}} by Mario Castoldi, Macchi's lead designer, to serve as modern monoplane fighter aircraft, furnished with retractable landing gear and powered by a radial engine. It possessed excellent maneuverability and general flying characteristics left little <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> Stability in a high-speed dive was exceptional, but it was underpowered and underarmed in comparison to its contemporaries. Early on, {{there were a number}} of crashes caused by stability problems, nearly resulting in the grounding of the type, which was ultimately addressed via aerodynamic modifications performed to the wing.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} improved, so {{also did}} {{the kinds of}} innovative performances Tibbits {{was able to put}} on stage. Such obscure technologies as cinematoscopes and luminere cinematographs offered the promise of displaying moving pictures. Kleine's Lumiere Cinematograph promised families the chance to see their sons in the Spanish–American War march toward the camera. Thomas Edison's Magniscope never reached Coldwater because it exploded en route, but his Animotoscope did. Eventually the Lyman H. Howe Company offered genuine moving pictures with its Vivograph Graphophone, which depicted a train ride through the Rocy Mountain's Frazer River Canyon. While such technologies had much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> in terms of quality, they were nonetheless important steps in the march toward the modern cinema.|$|E
25|$|Quine's work in logic {{gradually}} became dated in some respects. Techniques {{he did not}} teach and discuss include analytic tableaux, recursive functions, and model theory. His treatment of metalogic left something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> For example, Mathematical Logic does not include any proofs of soundness and completeness. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of Principia Mathematica. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his Methods of Logic) for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.|$|E

This study used matched vignettes to dissociate a number of moral factors and mental states. Results {{support the view that}} mental states, and not moral factors, explain the side-effect effect. However, the critical mental states appear not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desires</b> as proposed in standard models, but rather ‘deeper’ evaluative states including values and core evaluative attitudes...|$|R

25|$|The new-look team {{opened their}} season {{with an easy}} 95–65 victory away to London Capital, and {{compiled}} a six-game unbeaten run at home with wins against such teams as the Everton Tigers, Newcastle Eagles and Milton Keynes Lions. However, the team's form on the road left something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> and after the opening win against London Capital, the Heat lost their next five games away from Guildford. Things got worse in December, when the Heat lost their 100% home record, losing 83–97 to the table-topping Sheffield Sharks. This {{was the start of}} a six-game losing streak, halted by a New Year's Day win against the Essex Pirates and finally a triumph on the road, a 74–72 win against the Leicester Riders in the BBL Trophy.|$|E
25|$|With his assault {{schedule}} {{thrown out}} of whack by the PAVN, and his troops consequently in trouble, Vang Pao went looking for help. On 1 September, he made an emergency flight to Vientiane for a tense meeting with Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley at the airfield. Hoping to cadge more air support, the general blamed a shortage of tactical air for the offensive's lack of success. From Godley's standpoint, the Hmong unit commanders left much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired</b> for combat leadership of a force crippled by trench foot. The ambassador {{made it clear that}} U.S. tactical air support was limited to 18 daily sorties. He then asked if Vang Pao would continue the offensive on those terms. At this, Vang Pao returned to battle, knowing that saving Long Tieng was essential for the Royalists.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{training}} left much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> Stalin’s purges had deprived the VVS of its {{senior and}} best commanders. It heralded a debilitating decline in military effectiveness. In {{the event of}} the Winter War and the German victory in the French Campaign, the Soviet leadership panicked and Stalin ordered a hasty overhaul of the armed forces. Order 0362, 22 December 1940, of the People’s Commissar Defence ordered the accelerated training program for pilots which meant the cutting of training time. The program had already been cut owing to an earlier defence order, 008, dated 14 March 1940. It {{put an end to}} the flight training for volunteers, and instituted mass drafts. In February 1941, pilot training was cut further leading to a disastrous drop in the quality of pilot training prior to Barbarossa.|$|E

25|$|For 20 years William McBurney, head of Belfast-based Outlet Records {{for over}} 40 years, {{received}} royalties from {{the sales of}} vinyl and CDs, including many compilations. He claimed that he bought the rights in good faith from Jim Slye, who managed Horslips from the late 1970s until the band's final gig. However, the quality of these releases left much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b> Shoddy artwork and poor sound meant {{that most of these}} releases were sold at bargain prices, leaving the five former band members disillusioned. They fought back and on 7 March 1999 won a court victory in Belfast for copyright ownership and a substantial financial settlement. Horslips are now once again fully in control of their music and they released the entire back catalogue on CD in 2000/2001 with updated artwork and digitally remastered sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble in 1989 and 1990 was to herald {{an era of}} Indian cricket that was dominated by stars and individual brilliance. Sachin Tendulkar became arguably the best batsman in the world, along with Brian Lara of the West Indies and in 1998, Sir Donald Bradman himself remarked that Tendulkar batting style was similar to his. Mohammed Azharuddin, who captained India {{for most of the}} 1990s, proved a captain whose main strength, if not his motivational skills, was an ability to stay cool under pressure. Azharuddin's artistic batting however declined during the later years of his captaincy, and his best innings during this time were mostly when playing at home. The Hyderabadi stylist's career ended after 99 Tests when he was banned for life after being implicated in the match-fixing scandal. Under his captaincy, the Indian team became virtually unbeatable at home, with big wins against teams such as England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. Their performances abroad, however, left a lot <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b>|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>desired.</b>|$|E
