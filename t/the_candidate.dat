5|$|Article 4, Section 7, of the Indiana Constitution {{states the}} {{qualifications}} {{to become a}} Senator or Representative. <b>The</b> <b>candidate</b> {{must have been a}} U.S. citizen for a minimum of two years prior to his candidacy and must have been resident of the district that he seeks to represent for one year. Senators must be at least twenty-five years of age and representatives must be twenty-one when sworn into office. <b>The</b> <b>candidate</b> cannot hold any other public office in the state or federal government during their term. <b>The</b> <b>candidate</b> must also be a registered voter within the district they seek to represent.

50|$|Part 2 is a {{collaborative}} task with <b>the</b> other <b>candidate(s).</b> <b>The</b> examiner gives <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> some pictures and describes a situation. <b>The</b> <b>candidates</b> discuss <b>the</b> issues {{and decide what}} would be best in the situation.|$|R
50|$|Invigilators must be {{as quiet}} as {{possible}} during the examination duration but also remain vigilant to <b>the</b> <b>candidates.</b> They should not explain any questions asked by <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> or allow any other person to ask questions of, or read answers to, <b>the</b> <b>candidates.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{absolute}} {{minimum requirement}} of any body of Freemasons is that <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> must be free, and {{considered to be}} of good character. There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> should be a mature adult.|$|E

50|$|The closest races were in {{the fourth}} {{district}} (where only 27 votes separated <b>the</b> <b>candidates),</b> <b>the</b> fifth district (23 votes separated <b>the</b> leading <b>candidates,</b> and 87 votes went to independent <b>candidates)</b> and <b>the</b> ninth where a mere 9 votes separated <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> (46 votes having gone to <b>the</b> independent <b>candidate)</b> and a recount was conducted.|$|R

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> will {{typically}} have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E

UFC President Olympio, whose candidacy {{had long been}} announced and expected, was in the United States at the time, suffering from backache, {{and was unable to}} travel to Togo to undergo the necessary medical review for his candidacy. Consequently, the UFC submitted the candidacy of its Secretary-General, Jean-Pierre Fabre.|$|R

5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> {{cities are}} selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more {{detailed}} presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file.

After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running.

Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E
