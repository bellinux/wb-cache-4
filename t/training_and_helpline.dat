50|$|The Mass. Council on Compulsive Gambling {{was founded}} in 1983 by Thomas N. Cummings and {{a small group of}} others {{affected}} by gambling problems. Together, they identified a need for statewide problem-gambling services. Tom served as Executive Director until his passing in January 1998.Today, there is a greater awareness of problem gambling in Massachusetts. The Mass. Council provides problem gambling education, trainings and events. There is also access to statewide Department of Public Health problem-gambling treatment facilities throughout Massachusetts.Services provided by the Council include information and public awareness, education <b>and</b> <b>training,</b> advocacy, referral <b>and</b> <b>helpline</b> <b>and</b> prevention programs.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are over}} 1500 UK health helplines in operation, {{yet we have}} scant {{knowledge}} about the resources in place to support the seeking and delivering of cancer-related telephone help and support. This research aimed to identify and describe cancer <b>and</b> cancer-related <b>helpline</b> service provision: the number of helplines available, the variety of services provided and accessibility of those services. METHOD: Online national questionnaire survey sent to 95 cancer <b>and</b> cancer-related <b>helplines</b> in the UK RESULTS: 69 (73 %) of 95 surveyed cancer <b>and</b> cancer-related <b>helplines</b> completed the survey. Most helplines/organisations were registered charities, supported by donations. 73. 5 % of helplines had national coverage. Most helplines served all age groups, ethnic groups, and men and women. Only 13. 4 % had a number that was free from landlines and most mobile networks and 56. 6 % could only be contacted during working hours. Over 50 % of helplines reported no provisions for callers with additional needs. 55 % had no clinical staff available to callers. Ongoing support <b>and</b> <b>training</b> for <b>helpline</b> staff was available but variable. CONCLUSION: While cancer helplines in the UK offer reasonably broad coverage across the country, there are still potential barriers to accessibility. There are also opportunities to optimise the training of staff/volunteers across the sector. There are further prospects for helplines to enhance services and sustain appropriate and realistic quality standards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{addition}} to technical documentation, face-to-face helpdesks <b>and</b> telephonic <b>helplines</b> are a powerful means for supporting users of technical products and services. This study investigates {{the factors that}} determine user satisfaction with helpdesks <b>and</b> <b>helplines.</b> A survey, based on the SERVQUAL framework and questionnaire, shows that the SERVQUAL dimensions of customer satisfaction are not applicable in these contexts. Three quality dimensions were found instead: solution quality, {{the experience of the}} consultation, and, {{in the case of a}} physical environment, the so-called tangibles. Helpdesk customers base their overall quality perceptions mainly on their experiences during a consultation, while helpline customers focus strongly on the quality of the solution offered. The study also found a connection between the perceived <b>helpline</b> quality <b>and</b> the appreciation of the primary service. Index Terms—Helpdesk, helpline, SERVQUAL, user satisfaction, user support. Technical products and services are usually accompanied by several forms of user support, varying from <b>training</b> <b>and</b> user instructions to websites and the availability of technical support.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the career guidance needs of post-secondary learners who used the NQF <b>and</b> CAS <b>Helpline</b> during January 2014. The objectives-opportunities-constraints (OOC) theoretical framework of Dickenson and McIntosh (2010) was {{used to describe the}} career guidance needs of these learners. The documents from the NQF <b>and</b> CAS <b>Helpline</b> were purposefully selected and comprised transcripts of conversations that took place between the post-secondary school learners and advisors at the NQF <b>and</b> CAS <b>Helpline</b> <b>and</b> that were captured on the Insight 2 database. The data from the transcripts and research journal were deductively analysed, and three thematic categories were used to answer the research question. The learners requested information from the Helpline advisors on educational goals (including information on tertiary training institutions, on admission requirements for tertiary institutions, on the accreditation/registration of institutions, and on improving Grade 12 results) and on opportunities (such as learnerships and employment) in the post-secondary environment. They also requested support in overcoming constraints such as career confusion and financial challenges. The findings confirmed the need for a career helpline service to provide learners with career information and career guidance in order to help them achieve later career success. It is hoped that the study will raise awareness of the career guidance needs of postsecondary learners and also inform the training of advisors at the NQF <b>and</b> CAS <b>Helpline.</b> The findings may also shed light on strategies and interventions to assist learners with the career decision-making process at school and in the post-secondary environment.
