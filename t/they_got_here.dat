6000|$|... "Quite that, captain. The flock {{must have}} been dead beat, by the time <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> I should think they must have stopped here, last night. We will soon see--there {{is one of their}} fireplaces." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our ladies, we grant, walk {{alone in}} the street [...] (Observe, by-the-by, on what {{delicate}} feet!) [...] 'Tis a habit <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> at home, where they say [...] The men from politeness go seldom astray.|$|E
25|$|What spinners? Didn't {{know they}} had brought any with 'em. Underwood, Wilson and Illingworth can't turn the ball in normal English conditions, so what hope have <b>they</b> <b>got</b> out <b>here?</b> Taking wickets in Australia is hard work, I can't see these three having any success.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true enough, sir; but, you see, {{the glass}} gave us notice {{three hours before}} we caught it. Besides, they {{certainly}} took native pilots on board as soon as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> out <b>here,</b> and these must have got them into some safe place {{at the first sign}} of a gale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wonder is <b>they</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>here</b> before. <b>They</b> must {{be really}} nervous. Crane says {{the people in}} town have very bad hearts. As near as I can make out they faced him up and {{threatened}} his life. He says the mob is hanging round {{the edge of the}} reservation crazy for blood. He got shy and took to the hills." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{why is it}} {{that this}} spurge, and St. Patrick's cabbage, grow only here in the west? If <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> of themselves, where did they come from? All outside there is sea; and they could not float over that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe ye--I believe ye. Eneugh said--eneugh said. We'se hae {{your legs}} loose by breakfast-time.--And now let's hear what thir chamber chiels o' yours hae {{to say for}} themselves, or how, {{in the name of}} unrule, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> at this time o' night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ormsgill laughed. [...] "There are, it seems, {{a few of}} them in the country. I {{have now}} and then come across American rifles, too. I don't know how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> and it's not my business, but it is {{generally}} believed that officials now and then acquire a competence by keeping a hand open and their eyes shut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought there}} was {{something}} queer about it," [...] the policeman remarked. [...] "Soon after you had gone inside, two gentlemen drove up in a hansom. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> out <b>here</b> {{and one of them}} spoke to your driver, who shook his head and pointed to his flag. The gent then said something else to him--can't say as I heard what it was, but it was probably offering him double fare. Anyway, <b>they</b> both <b>got</b> in and off went your taxi, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} who I am, young man. I'm {{responsible}} for these boys, though. And they promised me they wouldn't do no more stealing. They're {{going to work for}} what they get. And <b>they</b> <b>got</b> a right <b>here</b> on this land. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> permission. That's more than you got, I venture, with your nasty guns and all, coming around here-- Have you got a warrant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When, at last, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> it <b>here,</b> it {{took them}} nearly a year to {{construct}} the machines for raising it. They built the pedestal for it to stand upon, which you see {{is as high as}} a two-story house, and then appointed a day for the raising. All the world, almost, came to see. This whole square was full. There were more than a hundred thousand persons here. The king came, and his family, and all his generals and great officers. It was the greatest raising that ever was seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is all well, but I had a fright, {{yesterday}} morning. The Bairds searched every {{cottage and}} hut over the hills, on this side, {{and they say}} their men rode almost as far as Galloway; but they gave up the search before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> feeling assured that they must have passed you, very soon after you left the hold, and you could never have got as far down as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, these bits look, as you say, as if {{they had}} been chipped off a rock, not like water-worn stones. Though how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> where {{everywhere}} else things are perfectly tidy, I cannot say. However, we can think that over afterwards. Now for the stone! Let us all put our weight against this projecting end. I don't in the least expect that we can move it, but at any rate we can try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have been}} terribly upset," [...] John went on, {{as his wife}} left the room. [...] "They were only told {{of the loss of}} their mother after they arrived, yesterday. Oswald thought that they would need all their {{strength}} for the journey, and that it were better that Mary should break the news to them, when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> We have all felt for you sorely, Adam, since your messenger brought the news." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the further}} {{corner from the}} cedar she perched herself up upon the parapet and {{achieved}} an air of comfort among the lichenous stones. [...] "Now tell me," [...] she said, [...] "all about yourself. Tell me about yourself; I know such duffers of men! They all do the same things. How did you get--here? All my men WERE <b>here.</b> <b>They</b> couldn't have <b>got</b> <b>here</b> if <b>they</b> hadn't been here always. They wouldn't have thought it right. You've climbed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Caro {{spent the}} {{academic}} year of 1965-1966 as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. During a class on urban planning and land use, the experience of watching Moses returned to him. They were talking one day about highways and where <b>they</b> <b>got</b> built...and <b>here</b> were these mathematical formulas about traffic density and population density and so on, {{and all of a}} sudden I said to myself: [...] "This is completely wrong. This isn't why highways get built. Highways get built because Robert Moses wants them built there. If you don't find out and explain to people where Robert Moses gets his power, then everything else you do is going to be dishonest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he don't miss any {{property}} by it, because he'll {{get that}} all right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give {{anything in this}} world to see HIM before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys together--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's the deef and dumb one--William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George {{were the only ones}} that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, <b>they</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>here</b> in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{if there}} were no one here the brigands might {{discover}} that we had gone, within an hour or so of our starting. They might fire a shot or two, and, finding that we did not answer, crawl gradually down till <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> for it must seem possible to them that we should return down the pass; and as there is no getting the baggage mules to go fast, we might very well be overtaken--I don't mean by those eight men, but by a considerable number." ...|$|E
60|$|The king {{received}} {{us as we}} drew off at {{the foot}} of the hill, calling the soldiers his brave Scots, and commending the officers by name. The next morning the castle was also taken by storm, and the greatest booty that ever was found in any one conquest in the whole war; the soldiers got here so much money that they knew not what to do with it, and the plunder <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> and at the battle of Leipsic made them so unruly, that had not the king been the best master of discipline in the world, they had never been kept in any reasonable bounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there be}} a miracle," [...] he said, [...] "good father, it is that our eyes have been blinded so long. Think you, for a moment, that two lads who have been brought up among the Indians, from their childhood, could manage a boat in such a sea as this? Why, if their story were true they could, neither of them, ever have handled an oar; and these are sailors, {{skillful}} and daring beyond the common, and have ventured a feat that none of our people here on shore were willing to undertake. How <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> I know not, but assuredly they are English sailors. This will account for their blue eyes and light hair, which have so puzzled us; and for that ignorance of Spanish, which they so craftily accounted for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From that to five; {{but even}} if the barge were delayed, and you got there first, which is very unlikely, I do not think that there would be the remotest chance of finding those villains on board. I reckon they would, as we agreed, launch the body {{overboard}} even before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> under way <b>here,</b> and they may either have landed again before the craft got under way, pretending that they had changed their minds, and then walked across to The Hague or to Haarlem, or have gone on with the barge for two hours, or even until daybreak. If by that time they were near Rotterdam, they may have stayed on board till <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there; if not, they may have landed, and finished the journey on foot, but they would certainly not have stopped on board after six or seven o'clock this morning. They would calculate that possibly we might get on their track at an early hour this morning, and set out in pursuit at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't draw such along face, Terence," [...] he said, as the lad entered; [...] "we are {{all going}} on well. Your father has been bandaged all over the chest and body, {{and is able to}} breathe more comfortably; as for me, except that I feel as if {{somebody}} were twisting a red-hot needle about in my arm, I am as right as possible, and Saunders is doing first-rate. The doctors thought at first that he had got a ball through his body; after <b>they</b> <b>got</b> him <b>here</b> <b>they</b> had time to examine him carefully, and they find that it has just run along the ribs and gone out behind, and that he will soon be about again. If it wasn't that the doctors say I must drink nothing but water with lemon-juice squeezed into it, I would have nothing to complain of. We have got our servants. Hoolan came in blubbering like a calf, the omadhoun, and I had to threaten to send him back to the regiment before he would be sensible. He has sworn off spirits until I am well enough to take to them, which is a comfort, for I am sorry to say he is one of those men who never know when they have had enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Squire, the up {{coach was}} stopped a mile before it <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> and the {{passengers}} robbed. It was due here at one, {{and did not}} come in till half an hour later. Of course I was sent for. The guard was shot. There {{were two of the}} fellows. He let fly with his blunderbuss, but he {{does not seem to have}} hit either of them, and one rode up and shot him dead; then they robbed all the passengers. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> six gold watches, some rings, and, adding up the amounts taken from all the passengers, about a hundred and fifty pounds in money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{brought him}} home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered {{off the coast}} of Andres! An' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above," [...] he pointed northwards, [...] "or where the {{currants}} may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowery, I knew his father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in '20, or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later, or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums aboot it! I tell ye that when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> they'd be jommlin' and jostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an' tryin' to tie up our cuts by the aurora borealis." [...] This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.|$|E
6000|$|... 5. Mr. Secretary St. John {{sent for}} me this morning so early, that I was forced to go without shaving, which put me quite out of method. I called at Mr. Ford's, and desired him to lend me a shaving; and so made a shift to get into order again. Lord! here is an impertinence: Sir Andrew Fountaine's mother and sister(2) are come above a hundred miles, from Worcester, to see him before he died. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> but yesterday; and {{he must have been}} past hopes, or past fears, before they could reach him. I fell a scolding when I heard they were coming; and the people about him {{wondered}} at me, and said what a mighty content it would be on both sides to die when they were with him! I knew the mother; she is the greatest Overdo(3) upon earth; and the sister, they say, is worse; the poor man will relapse again among them. Here was the scoundrel brother always crying in the outer room till Sir Andrew was in danger; and the dog was to have all his estate if he died; and it is an ignorant, worthless, scoundrel-rake: and the nurses were comforting him, and desiring he would not take on so. I dined to-day the first time with Ophy Butler(4) and his wife; and you supped with the Dean, and lost two-and-twenty pence at cards. And so Mrs. Walls is brought to bed of a girl, who died two days after it was christened; and, betwixt you and me, she is not very sorry: she loves her ease and diversions too well to be troubled with children. I will go to bed.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Michael Stokes, {{a biology}} {{professor}} at Western Kentucky University, {{commented that the}} probable cause for the abundance of white squirrels on university campuses was because they were originally introduced by someone: [...] "We're not sure how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> but I'll {{tell you how it}} usually happens...When you see them, especially around a college campus or parks, somebody brought them in because they thought it would be neat to have white squirrels around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} better," [...] said Mr Egerton, [...] "but <b>they</b> have <b>got</b> work." [...] <b>Here</b> several gentlemen entered, enquiring whether the evening papers were in {{and what was}} the news from Birmingham.|$|R
6000|$|The room in {{the hotel}} where the general {{meetings}} of [...] "The Island Navigation Company" [...] were held was nearly full when the secretary {{came through the door}} which as yet divided the shareholders from their directors. Having surveyed their empty chairs, their ink and papers, and nodded to a shareholder or two, he stood, watch in hand, contemplating the congregation. A thicker attendance than he had ever seen! Due, no doubt, to the lower dividend, and this Pillin business. And his tongue curled. For if he had a natural contempt for his Board, {{with the exception of the}} chairman, he had a still more natural contempt for his shareholders. Amusing spectacle when you came to think of it, a general meeting! Unique! Eighty or a hundred men, and five women, assembled through sheer devotion to their money. Was any other function in the world so single-hearted. Church was nothing to it--so many motives were mingled there with devotion to one's soul. A well-educated young man--reader of Anatole France, and other writers--he enjoyed ironic speculation. What earthly good did <b>they</b> think <b>they</b> <b>got</b> by coming <b>here?</b> Half-past two! He put his watch back into his pocket, and passed into the Board-room.|$|R

50|$|Anarchists {{contribute}} to an anti-authoritarian push, which challenges all abstract power on a fundamental level, striving for egalitarian relationships and promoting communities based upon mutual aid. Primitivists, however, extend ideas of non-domination to all life, not just human life, going beyond the traditional anarchist's analysis. From by anthropologists, primitivists look at the origins of civilization so as to understand what they are up against and how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> in order to inform a change in direction. Inspired by the Luddites, primitivists rekindle an anti-technological orientation. Insurrectionalists {{do not believe in}} waiting for critiques to be fine-tuned, instead spontaneously attacking civilization's current institutions.|$|E
50|$|While taking {{pictures}} of attractions (also taking down tourists and Atlantean guards blocking the way), Patrick accidentally destroys the oldest living bubble and tell the truth to LRH who shows them the real bubble. Squidward reminds them that the bubble that Patrick destroyed was a prop for tourists. Patrick again accidentally pops it for real and the group must run from Atlantean forces, searching for paper clips to open doors. Sandy uses Squidward as a gun to take down the soldiers. Plankton rampages around the city in his tank {{just like in the}} beginning and confronts the gang in which ends the duo's flashback of how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> He fires his weapon, but is shocked to see it shoots ice cream. LRH captures Plankton, believing he is a talking speck, and displays him as a replacement for the recently destroyed bubble and as a replacement to the national treasure of Atlantis. He then orders one of his soldiers to throw away the amulet so that the troublemakers can't return. The soldier makes his way across Atlantis to the dumpster and tosses it in. Then the gang head home back to Bikini Bottom on board the bus.|$|E
40|$|While writing these poems, I thought {{critically}} {{about my}} existence {{and the existence}} of others in ways that were both difficult and enlightening for me. I was definitely altered, but to have such an effect on anyone else is a large undertaking. It feels a bit like a one-sided relationship that the world I have interacted with for this project (that is, the specific poets and locations I studied) will likely never interact with me. My hope with this collection, however, is that I can draw the attention of my readers to {{some of the issues that}} concerned me and inspired my writing. I want them to question their own place in the world [...] how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> how stuck they are in it, how they do and should feel about it [...] and furthermore their ability, willingness, or necessity to empathize. I want to alter their thoughts for as long as I have their eyes on my work. If I am right about this collection 2 ̆ 7 s theory on the unbreakable connection between the world and the individual, then that will be enough to start changing our small place in the world...|$|E
