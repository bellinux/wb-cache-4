30|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that susceptibility to TdP arises from the induction of afterdepolarization and increased dispersion of ventricular repolarization, rather than QT interval prolongation per se [11]. <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongation is now recognized as a good indicator of the risk of TdP, because the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> is a surrogate of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) across the myocardial wall [12]. While neither the normal range of <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> nor the indications for the need of correction by heart rate have been defined yet, mean Tp-e intervals in healthy children or adults have been reported to be approximately 65 or 76  ms, respectively [13 – 15].

Methods: Patients with typical symptoms of coronary heart disease were examined by ambulatory blood monitoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and coronary angiography, and were assigned to two groups {{on the basis of}} blood pressure: an MH group and a morning normotension (MN) group. The following data were collected and compared: basic characteristic, <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval,</b> corrected QT (QTc) interval, echocardiography parameters, and Gensini score of the two groups. Results: Three hundred fifty-eight patients, {{with a mean age of}} 64 years (54. 1 % men), were divided into the MH group (n= 170) and the MN group (n= 188). <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> (84. 52 ± 14. 77 ms vs. 65. 19 ± 19. 03 ms, P< 0. 001), QTc interval (416. 21 ± 29. 59 ms vs. 401. 70 ± 36. 10 ms, P< 0. 001), left ventricular mass index (121. 42 ± 10. 97 g/m 2 vs. 105. 63 ± 17. 10 g/m 2, P< 0. 001), and Gensini score (72. 12 ± 32. 90 vs. 39. 47 ± 29. 32, P< 0. 001) were significantly increased in the MH group compared with the MN group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{concept that}} the {{interval}} between the peak (T(peak)) and the end (T(end)) of the T wave (T(p-e)) {{is a measure of}} transmural dispersion of repolarization time is widely accepted but has not been tested rigorously by transmural mapping of the intact heart. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the relationship of T(p-e) to transmural dispersion of repolarization by correlating local repolarization times at endocardial, midmural, and epicardial sites in the left and right ventricles with the T wave of the ECG. METHODS: Local activation times, activation-recovery intervals, and repolarization times were measured at 98 epicardial sites and up to 120 midmural and endocardial sites in eight open-chest dogs. In four of the dogs, long-term cardiac memory was induced by 3 weeks of ventricular pacing at 130 bpm because previous data suggest that, in this setting, delayed epicardial repolarization increases transmural dispersion. The other four dogs were sham operated. RESULTS: In sham dogs, T(p-e) was 41 +/- 2. 2 ms (X +/- SEM), whereas the transmural dispersion of repolarization time was 2. 7 +/- 4. 2 ms (not significant between endocardium and epicardium). Cardiac memory was associated with evolution of a transmural gradient of 14. 5 +/- 1. 9 ms (P <. 02), with epicardium repolarizing later than endocardium. The corresponding T(p-e) was 43 +/- 2. 3 ms (not different from sham). In combined sham and memory dogs, <b>T(p-e)</b> <b>intervals</b> did not correlate with transmural dispersion of repolarization times. In contrast, dispersion of repolarization of the whole heart (measured as the difference between the earliest and the latest moment of repolarization from all left and right ventricular, endocardial, intramural, and epicardial recording sites) did correlate with T(p-e) (P <. 0005, r = 0. 98), although the latter underestimated total repolarization time by approximately 35 %. The explanation for this finding is that parts of the heart fully repolarize before the moment of T(peak). CONCLUSION: T(p-e) does not correlate with transmural dispersion of repolarization but is an index of total dispersion of repolarizatio...|$|R

Nine patients (8 men, 1 woman; 58 ± 10 years) were enrolled. The cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program consisted of walking, bicycling on an ergometer, and calisthenics for 30 - 50 minutes/session and 3 - 5 sessions/week for 3 months. ECGs of 31 consecutive sinus beats were obtained {{before and after the}} CR program. RR and QT intervals were measured in the aVL lead. The mean orthogonal distance from the diagonal to the points of the Poincaré plots was determined using the following equation; STVQT [= ΣQTn+ 1 -QTn/(30 × 21 / 2) ], as a marker of temporal dispersion of repolarization. Also, Tp-e of 5 consecutive beats was measured as a marker of spatial dispersion. No fatal arrhythmias were observed in the CR.

30|$|Sevoflurane {{inhibits}} HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) currents (IKr), LQT 1 /minK currents (IKs), and Kv 4.3 currents (Ito) [3, 4], and induces significant QT interval prolongation. However, as the prolongation {{is modest}} and sevoflurane {{does not affect}} the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> in healthy people [5, 6], sevoflurane is generally considered as a safe general anesthetic in terms of TdP and/or lethal arrhythmias, even in those with LQTS [16]. This is probably the first report which clearly demonstrates the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongation by sevoflurane not only in healthy people but also in patients with LQTS. We think of two reasons why the <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> is prolonged by sevoflurane: The case is a patient with LQTS 3, which is considered to be more dangerous than patients with LQT 1 and LQT 2, or the patient is poorly controlled preoperatively in terms of the QTc and Tp-e intervals. Because LQTS is relatively uncommon (1 in 2500), {{there is a lack of}} a robust evidence based on appropriate perioperative management, and there are few reports which systemically investigate the effect of sevoflurane on the QTc and the Tp-e intervals in LQTS patients. Whyte et al. reported that general anesthesia for LQTS patients was performed 128 of 158 (81 %) with volatile anesthetics including sevoflurane without any serious arrhythmias, such as TdP [17]. However, TdP has been reported to be induced by sevoflurane in some patients, including in a patient with LQT 2 [18], a patient with LQTS who received fluconazole infusion [19], and a patient with poorly controled diabetes [20], because both fluconazole and hyperglycemia inhibit potassium channels (Ikr channels) and induce QT interval prolongation [21, 22]. Furthermore, Kang et al. demonstrated that sevoflurane and DPI 201 - 106, which reduces Na+ channel inactivation and mimicks LQT 3, prolong action potential duration, and the combination of the two drugs has been shown to have an effect on guinea-pig hearts greater than an additive effect of their activities, indicating the potential risk for ventricular arrhythmias when sevoflurane is used for LQT 3 patients [23]. On the other hand, because propofol at clinically relevant concentrations neither affects Ikr [3] nor prolongs QTc interval [5, 6], propofol might have been used in the present patient, rather than sevoflurane.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{decline in}} {{mortality}} due to pump failure has been clearly documented after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), however {{the impact on}} sudden cardiac death {{and the development of}} malignant ventricular arrhythmias remains questionable. Our study aims to investigate this alleged pro-arrhythmic effect of CRT using surface electrocardiogram (ECG) markers of pro-arrhythmia. MethodsSeventy five patients, who received CRT were included in this study. Manual measurement of corrected QT interval (QTc), Tpeak-end (<b>Tp-e)</b> <b>interval,</b> QT dispersion (QTd) and Tpeak-end dispersion during baseline 12 lead surface ECG and after applying atrial-biventricular pacing were done. Arrhythmias post CRT was recorded from ECG, 24 h holter monitoring or pacemaker programmer event recorder. ResultsQTc interval showed significant prolongation after CRT (498. 9 ± 50. 8 vs. 476. 2 ± 41. 6 msec, P= 0. 0001). Comparing patients with major arrhythmogenic events (MAE) and increased frequency of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) post CRT pacing to those patients without arrhythmias, there was a significant prolongation of the QTc interval (527 ± 63. 29 vs. 496. 95 ± 45. 2 msec, P= 0. 043) and <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> (94. 16 ± 9 vs. 87. 41 ± 16. 37 msec, P= 0. 049). While in the arrhythmogenic group, there was an insignificant decrease in QTd and Tpeak-end dispersion. ConclusionQTc and Tp-e intervals are a potential predictor of occurrence of MAE and PVCs. On the other hand, Tp-e dispersion and QTd did not show a predictive potential for arrhythmia...|$|E
40|$|Left stellate {{or right}} stellate {{ganglion}} stimulation (LGSG or RSGS, respectively) {{is associated with}} ventricular tachyarrhythmias; however, the electrophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We assessed 1) regional dispersion of myocardial repolarization during RSGS and LSGS and 2) regional electrophysiological mechanisms underlying T-wave changes, including T-peak to T-end (<b>Tp-e)</b> <b>interval,</b> which are associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia/ventricular fibrillation. In 10 pigs, a 56 - electrode sock was placed around the heart, and both stellate ganglia were exposed. Unipolar electrograms, to asses activation recovery interval (ARI) and repolarization time (RT), and 12 -lead ECG were recorded before and during RSGS and LSGS. Both LSGS and RSGS increased dispersion of repolarization; with LSGS, the greatest regional dispersion occurred on the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall and LV apex, whereas with RSGS, the greatest regional dispersion occurred on the right ventricular posterior wall. Baseline, LSGS, and RSGS dispersion correlated with Tp-e. The increase in RT dispersion, which was due {{to an increase in}} ARI dispersion, correlated with the increase in Tp-e intervals (R 2 = 0. 92 LSGS; and R 2 = 0. 96 RSGS). During LSGS, the ARIs and RTs on the lateral and posterior walls were shorter than the anterior LV wall (P < 0. 01) and on the apex versus base (P < 0. 05), explaining the T-wave vector shift posteriorly/ inferiorly. RSGS caused greater ARI and RT shortening on anterior versus lateral or posterior walls (P < 0. 01) and on base versus apex (P < 0. 05), explaining the T-wave vector shift anteriorly/ superiorly. LSGS and RSGS cause differential effects on regional myocardial repolarization, explaining the ECG T-wave morphology. Sympathetic stimulation, in line with its proarrhythmic effects, increases <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval,</b> which correlates with increases in myocardial dispersion of repolarization. © 2013 the American Physiological Society...|$|E
30|$|The {{management}} {{and treatment of}} patients with LQT 3 differs from those with LQT 1 and LQT 2 due to the differences in pathophysiology. Consequently, anesthetic management of patients with LQT 3 for preventing lethal arrhythmias is also quite different. Unlike LQT 1 and LQT 2, bradycardia is a risk factor of TdP in LQT 3 cases, and β-blockers are not very effective in preventing lethal arrhythmias [1, 2]. Instead, several {{studies have shown that}} mexiletine or flecainide, Na+ channel blockers, significantly shorten the QTc interval [7, 8]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with LQT 3 are more likely to experience lethal arrhythmias than patients with LQT 1 and LQT 2, and the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) is recommended [9, 10]. On the other hand, the present patient was not administered with the above drugs, because he had not experienced any episode of syncope or lethal arrhythmias, such as TdP or VF, and his mother refused such treatment. However, his QTc interval and <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> prolongations were so marked that the doctor in charge tried to persuade the patient to take the drugs, but failed.|$|E
40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: Although {{myocardial}} bridging (MB) {{is defined}} as an angiographic phenomenon with a benign course, {{it has also been}} associated with adverse cardiovascular events. The effects of exercise on myocardial repolarization in patients with MB were tested in this study, with Tp-e and Tp-e/QT repolarization indexes. Material/Methods: A total of 50 patients in whom isolated MB was diagnosed at coronary angiography (CAG) (Group I) and 48 pa-tients with normal CAG results (Group II) were included in this study. The participants underwent treadmill ex-ercise stress testing according to the Bruce protocol. QT dispersion (QTd) was defined as the minimum QT in-terval subtracted from the maximum. The <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> was defined as the difference between the QT and the QT peak time period. QTd and Tp-e intervals were calculated for all patients before and after exercise testing and differences between groups were compared. Results: At peak exercise, QTd and cQTd showed a significant increase in comparison to baseline values in the group of patients with myocardial bridges. Significant increases were also found with exercise in the Tp-e, cTp-e dura-tions and Tp-e/QT ratio of the MB patient group in comparison to the baseline values. On the other hand, sig-nificant differences in QTd, cQTd, Tp-e, cTp-e intervals, and Tp-e/QT ratio during peak exercise in comparison with baseline values were not detected in the control group (p> 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Chronic {{renal failure}} (CRF) {{is a major}} factor for {{ventricular}} arrhythmia. Chronic inflammation and other factors contribute to formation of arrhythmogenic substrate. The aim of our study was to assess ventricular repolarization in CRF patients receiving hemodialysis, by using QT dispersion, T wave peak to T wave end interval (<b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval),</b> Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio. Material and Method: Electrocardiogram of 35 CRF patients receiving hemodialysis were studied. T wave peak to end interval, QT and corrected QT intervals and some other ECG intervals were measured. Electrocardiograms of age and sex matched 30 healthy individuals were also analyzed for comparison. Results: CRF group and control group were significantly different from each other for calculated Tp-e (92. 9 ± 24. 7 vs 77. 0 ± 9. 6, p= 0. 002), Tp-e/QTc (0. 20 ± 0. 0 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 0, p= 0. 007), QTd (58. 9 ± 45. 6 vs 27. 3 ± 7. 6, p= 0. 001), and Tp-e/QT (0. 24 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 21 ± 0. 0, p= 0. 034) values. QTc (457. 9 ± 50. 8 e karsi 436. 4 ± 43. 1, p= 0. 077) values were similar in both groups. Discussion: QTd, Tp-e, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc are relatively new markers which also indicate repolarization defects. Our findings indicate that these new markers may be useful in determination of ventricular electrical instability in CRF patients receiving hemodialysis...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to evaluate Tpeak-Tend interval (Tp-e) and other electrocardiographic parameters as risk factors for recurrence of life-threatening cardiac events in patients with the Brugada syndrome (BS). BackgroundThe <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> in the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been reported to predict life-threatening arrhythmias in the long QT syndrome. MethodsTwenty-nine patients with the ECG pattern of BS and 29 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were studied. The follow-up period was 42. 65 ± 24. 42 months (range 11 to 108 months). ResultsUpon presentation, five patients had suffered aborted sudden death, five syncope, and two presyncope. Eleven patients with the ECG pattern of BS had a prolonged (> 460 ms) QTc in V 2 but usually not in inferior or left leads. No patient had abnormally prolonged QT dispersion. Programmed electrical stimulation induced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 5 out of 26 patients. Inducibility did not predict recurrence of events. Cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted in 14 patients (all symptomatic and two asymptomatic). During follow-up, nine symptomatic patients experienced recurrences. Previous cardiac events and a QTc > 460 ms in V 2 were significant risk factors (p = 0. 00002 and p = 0. 03, respectively). Tp-e and Tp-e dispersion were significantly prolonged in patients with recurrences versus patients without events (104. 4 and 35. 6 ms vs. 87. 4 and 23. 2 ms; p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 03, respectively) or controls (90. 7 and 17. 9 ms; p = 0. 02 and p = 0. 001, respectively). ConclusionsOur study demonstrates significant correlation between previous events, QTc > 460 ms in V 2, Tp-e, and Tp-e dispersion and occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmic events, suggesting that these parameters may be useful in risk stratification of patients with the Brugada syndrome...|$|E
40|$|QTc {{interval}} prolongation is {{a serious}} diabetic complication and increases mortality rate. Hyperglycemia inhibits the rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium channel currents (Ikr) and prolongs the QTc interval on electrocardiograms. Sevoflurane also inhibits the Ikr and causes QTc interval prolongation. In fact, torsade de pointes occurred in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus during sevoflurane anesthesia. We enrolled 74 patients, including 37 normoglycemic patients (glycated hemoglobin [HbA 1 c]: < 6. 5 %) (NG group) and 37 chronically hyperglycemic patients (HbA 1 c: ≥ 6. 5 %) (HG group). Anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol and 0. 3 μg/kg/min remifentanil, and maintained with 2 % sevoflurane in 40 % O 2 and 0. 2 - 0. 3 μg/kg/min remifentanil. The QT interval and <b>Tp-e</b> <b>interval</b> (from the peak {{to the end of}} the T wave) were measured before and at 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the administration of sevoflurane and adjusted for the patient's heart rate (QTc and Tp-ec, respectively). P-values of < 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. The QTc and the Tp-ec intervals of the two groups did not differ significantly before the administration of sevoflurane. The QTc interval gradually increased with time in both groups and was significantly longer than the baseline value at 10 min after the administration of sevoflurane in both groups. The QTc interval of the HG group was significantly longer than that of the NG group at 90 min and 120 min after the administration of sevoflurane. The Tp-ec interval was not affected by sevoflurane in either group. We have demonstrated that sevoflurane significantly prolongs the QTc interval, and that the extent of the prolongation is significantly greater in chronically hyperglycemic patients than in normoglycemic patients. Although Tp-ec is not affected by sevoflurane, it should be noted that the simultaneous blockade of potassium channels would increase the risk of arrhythmias...|$|E
