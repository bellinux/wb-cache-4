There are also two smaller halls {{on each side of the}} Mahavira Hall. The main halls were all first built during the Liao Dynasty (907-1125), but only the Mahavira Hall is now considered a Liao Building. <b>The</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Gate</b> and Sansheng Hall were extensively renovated during the subsequent Jin dynasty, and are classified by scholars as being Jin buildings.|$|E

5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate.</b> When first built, the barbican was reached over a drawbridge and a masonry ramp that came up sharply from the town below; the modern path cuts east along {{the outside of the}} walls. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain, and the gate would originally have been protected by a portcullis.|$|E

5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate,</b> and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate,</b> a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>gates</b> were {{demolished}} in {{the early}} 20th century, and built over. The Hull General Cemetery went into receivership in the 1970s, and maintenance of the cemetery {{was taken over by}} Hull City Council. The final interment was in 1972, excluding the Quaker burial ground which had its last burial in 1974. The overgrown cemetery was cleared after being taken over by the council in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>gates,</b> and all <b>the</b> chapels had been demolished by 1983.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, {{commissioned}} by the painter Lluís Graner, he designed the decoration of the Sala Mercè, in the Rambla dels Estudis, {{one of the first}} cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batlló or the porter's lodge of the Park Güell.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{converted}} NY376's intersections with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts replaced traffic lights. A {{traffic signal}} {{used to control}} traffic for a pedestrian crosswalk was also removed {{as part of their}} construction. Another roundabout was constructed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has called the installation of roundabouts a success, stating that it has significantly calmed traffic, decreased congestion and increased traffic flow.|$|E

The highway continues through forested terrain to a junction with M-72 west of the city of Grayling. M-93 turns east, running concurrently along M-72 into town. As the highway approaches downtown, the landscape becomes more urbanized after crossing the Au Sable River. In Grayling, M-93 turns north along the former route of US27, which is now BLI-75. M-72 turns south with BLI-75 along James Street, ending the M-72/M-93 concurrency.|$|E

5|$|The Lakshmi Narayan temples complex, {{devoted to}} the Vaishnavite sect, {{includes}} the main Lakshmi Narayan temple, built in the 10th century by Raja Sahil Verman. It has been built to suit the local climatic conditions with wooden chatries and has a shikara, and a sanctum sanctorum (Garbhagriha), with an antarala and a mantapa. A metallic image of Garuda, the vahana (mount) of Vishnu is installed on the dwajastamba pillar at <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> of the temple. In 1678, Raja Chhatra Singh adorned the temple roof with gold plated pinnacles, as a riposte to Auranagzeb, who had ordered demolition of this temple.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> opened into an open parade ground/plaza {{in the center of}} the square. The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E
