40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{investigation}} of strategic managmene <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques used by Czech companies. The quantitative approach {{was used for the}} analysis of strategic management <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. The aim of the quantitative approach was to collect and analyse data about the awareness, satisfaction and utilization of strategic management <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. The empirical research was conducted via a questionnaire survey of Czech companies. Empirical data were collected from 74 companies in Czech Republic. For the data entry and processing data were used the Statictical package for the Social Science (SPSS). The study presents four groups of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques based on the perceived results of manager’s utilization and satisfaction. The most of the examined <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques concentrated on the two groups: (1) power tools, this group include the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques with high level of utilization and high level of satisfaction; (2) rudimentary tools, which includes the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques with low satisfaction and low utilization. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between utilization of strategic management <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques and managerial awareness. The results provide essential information on the application of strategic management <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques, and indicate the level of managerial awareness of strategic management <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. In addition the findings indicate a positive relationship between the utilization of strategic management <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques and managerial awareness...|$|R

5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body of the <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} total quality {{management}} (TQM) has been developed {{as a result of}} intense global competition. However, almost previous works were given less emphasis on technical aspects; <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques as mediators in TQM performance model, which identified as theoretical gap. In this study, institutional and system theory are applied for examining the relationship amongst TQM, business performance, <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. The main contribution {{of this study is to}} explore the relationships of TQM, <b>and</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques as mediators, which effect to business performance. Qualitative study has been conducted in six companies in automotive industries. Respondents were asked about issue of the industry and TQM. In addition, they also were requested to assess TQM, business performance (BP), <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques based on importance and practices. Spearman's rho was used to analyze correlation amongst them. This study result has identified ten constructs for TQM and six constructs for business performances. Furthermore, three <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques namely statistical process control (SPC), total productive maintenance (TPM) and lean production are the most important <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques in TQM implementation. Network diagram amongst the variable have been developed to understand the relationships. This study shows that there are significant correlation amongst TQM, <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques, and business performance. TQM have strong correlation with <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques (0. 714) and business performance (0. 928). Furthermore, <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques have also positive correlation with business performance (0. 899). The result shows that business performance is accounted 87 % by TQM. In addition, if TQM is implemented simultaneously with <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques, business performance is accounted to 91 % by TQM <b>and</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques...|$|R

40|$|Project Risk Management (PRM) {{plays an}} {{important}} part in determining project success and it is considered an essential activity for companies. The literature provides a vast amount of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques created to help project managers to deal with project risks. However, in practice, project managers use few <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. The aim of this research is to understand the reasons for the non-use of PRM <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques by project managers when dealing with risks in the Swedish manufacturing sector. In order to provide evidence on why project managers do not use PRM <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques, this study identifies a list of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques to investigate, and a list of possible reasons. Both these lists derive from the existing literature and past research. This qualitative study is based on multiple case studies of seven companies with nine respondents. The companies are based in the Umeå region and operate in the manufacturing sector. This study has revealed that project managers, within the sample, prefer to use qualitative <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques such as meetings and expert judgements when dealing with risks. On the contrary, most of the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques for quantitative risk analysis are not used. There is a lack of awareness regarding the existing <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques, and in general regarding the basic concepts of Risk Management (RM). Project managers tend to heavily rely on intuition and past experience when dealing with project risks. Other reasons that account for the non-use of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques are lack of resources and an unwarranted use in relation to the project type. In some cases project managers might avoid or delay the management of negative risks and therefore to do not use <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. Furthermore, two more reasons emerge from the analysis of data, which contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the reasons behind the non-use of PRM <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. These reasons are small increment in quality of RM by using PRM <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques and complacency by project managers when using PRM <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques. This research extends prior literature by providing evidence on the use and non-use of PRM <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> techniques and the reasons for their non-use in a sector where there is a lack of research. Finally, two more reasons are discovered and can contribute to a better understanding of the existing gap between theory and practice of RM...|$|R

5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization <b>tool,</b> <b>and</b> a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
