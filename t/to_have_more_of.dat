5|$|The {{weather in}} Glasgow was stormy, with torrential rain nearly {{flooding}} Hampden Park. As a result, the stadium didn't reach its normal capacity of 100,000, only 41,657 spectators attended the match. The first half was mostly uneventful, both teams negated {{the threat of}} the other. Despite this both sides had opportunities to take the lead. At the start of the match, Liverpool striker Ian St. John had a shot cleared off the goal line and midway through the second half Dortmund defender Theodor Redder almost scored an own goal. Towards the end of the half, Dortmund began <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an attacking threat.

25|$|Bolo punch : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which {{owes its}} power to the {{shortening}} of a circular arc rather than to transference of body weight; it tends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an effect due {{to the surprise of}} the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former welterweight champions Sugar Ray Leonard, and Kid Gavilan. Middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.|$|E

In 2003, a fine was instated for chapters with a number of girls under the campus total number of girls possible to recruit. This controversial fine was created with the intention of keeping chapters active in recruitment.

25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.|$|E
25|$|The transit {{strike was}} the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city {{complete}} control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, one of the neighborhoods where the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without due process. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a protracted citywide teachers' strike that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November. The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors. Many thought the mayor had made a bad situation worse by taking sides against the teachers. The episode left a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews that went on for years, and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.|$|E
500|$|Though Bobby is [...] "fairly content, {{at least}} on the surface, to be alone in the world", he slowly comes to be a {{surrogate}} father for Sam and Dean.

[...] Although he loves each of them [...] "like a son", Bobby is willing to allow the brothers to put themselves in harm's way if it is absolutely necessary. For example, when Dean wants to detoxify Sam from his addiction to demon blood in [...] "When the Levee Breaks", Bobby instead points out that Sam giving in to his demonic abilities could help him to prevent Lucifer's return, even though the amount of blood required to kill Lilith would [...] "change [...] forever". Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be.

However, following 5 h of ball-milling CWS increased quite dramatically in the ceramic pot (72. 6 %) and in the stainless steel pot (70. 7 %), as compared to the untreated maize starches (2. 9 %). In addition, as CWS increased, the regions of amorphism enlarged {{at the expense of the}} crystalline regions, resulting in a change from the native starch state (oval with a smooth surface) <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a rough, abrasive surface. Finally, the transparency of the starch increased as CWS increased and that the syneresis of freeze–thawed ball-milled maize starch also increased with an increase in the number of freeze–thaw cycles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe used a hydromorphological {{model to}} assess areas of {{potential}} high denitrification rates and nitrous oxide release in a frequently and an infrequently connected fl oodplain {{system of the}} Danube River under different river discharge conditions. Based on the model’s projections, the decoupled floodplain was predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> areas <b>of</b> high potential denitrification during mean and elevated discharge, but with more sites dominated by incomplete denitrification, resulting in higher N 2 O emission. In the restored floodplain, frequently inundated, the model predicted that lower rates of denitrification would occur at lower river discharge levels, dominated by complete denitrification, resulting in N 2 rather than N 2 O production. During an annual flood (5300 m 3 s– 1), flooding both floodplains, the restored floodplain was predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> areas <b>of</b> high potential denitrification activity than the decoupled floodplain. The model outputs suggest that floodplains subject to frequent inundations can effectively and efficiently use nitrate input from the main river channel, resulting in complete denitrification. Restoration measures should attempt to promote frequent inundation periods in order to fully realize the high denitrification potential of floodplain systems...|$|R
