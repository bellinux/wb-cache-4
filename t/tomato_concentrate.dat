40|$|Background: Tomato {{has a high}} {{antioxidant}} capacity due to {{its high}} content of vitamin C, vitamin E and lycopene that is a powerful free radical scavenger. However, the effects of tomato on plasma lipoproteins is not well known, {{and there is little}} evidence about the relationship between tomato consumption and oxidative state changes in humans. Aim: To assess in vivo the effects of dietary supplementation with pure <b>concentrated</b> <b>tomato</b> juice on short term changes in oxidative state and plasma lipoproteins in healthy volunteers. Subjects and methods: Seventeen healthy volunteers were studied. They received a supplement of pure tomato juice during 7 days. At baseline, {{at the end of the}} supplementarion period and eight days after the end of the supplementation, a blood sample was drawn to measure total antioxidant capacity (TRAP), enzymatic antioxidants (catalase and superoxide dismutase), non-enzimatic antioxidants (lycopene and a-tocopherol) and plasma lipoproteins.

40|$|The heat {{process is}} a safe method of food preservation. The use of {{mathematical}} modeling for heat transfer by finite elements analysis (FEA) {{makes it possible to}} determine the cold spot of conventional and non conventional packages, evaluate their thermal history, microbial and enzyme inactivation and nutrients retention for an optimum process design. Several works use simplifications during mathematical modeling, such as adiabatic headspace, considering the thermal resistance of package negligible. The impact of these simplifications is rarely evaluated. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of these simplifications on sterilization value (Fp) for a conductive food. Two commercial glass bottles (G 1 and G 2) were selected for the assays. FEA model was built using the bottles' real geometries. Three methodologies were evaluated, considering (i) the four components of the system, i. e., product, glass wall, headspace and metal cap, and uniform heating (PGHM); (ii) adiabatic headspace, i. e., a model considering product and glass wall, with its upper side adiabatic (PG); and (iii) only product, with adiabatic upper side (P). A <b>tomato</b> <b>concentrate</b> industrial pasteurizator profile was used as boundary condition. The Fp was determined by using two values of thermal coefficient (z), 5. 5 (sic) C and 12. 5 (sic) C, representing a possible range of contaminant's z-value. The cold spot of the two packages was located at 32 % (G 1) and 46 % (G 2) of the product height. For the same process, the differences of Fp for the two packages ranged between 62 and 320 %. Comparing the Fp by PGHM and PG models, differences were observed between 4 and 13 %. These differences were over 45 % when comparing PGHM with P models, even with similar thermal history. The results indicated the importance of the previous evaluation of the impact of each simplification on the accuracy of the model. Due to exponential relationship between temperature and reactions during the heat process, the need for Fp evaluation instead of thermal history in conductive food was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{commercial development}} of agriculturally based industries {{is the basis}} for many of the projects that the Organisation has executed on behalf of the Government of Pakistan over the years. Normally this is implicit in the technical advice that is offered, in the training that is given or the equipment that is purchased for use by a particular project. In the case of project TCP/PAK/ 0154 the model adopted has been more imaginative. The project was designed to encourage a shift in thinking; to introduce the commercial reality of the marketplace as the basis for production; to encourage the entrepreneur. The modest successes of the project should be seen in this context. The Agri-Business Cell (ABC) established in the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives in 1990 was supported for a period of more than two years by the project; the experience gained has enabled the ABC to attract further agency interest, and to determine the model most applicable to domestic requirements. The ABC has been (and continues to be) a pioneering unit; providing an enabling environment in which the resources of the Ministry concerned and the private sector can be re-directed into the commercial development of an industrial sub-sector which may show promise. Change has been a dominant feature of the ABC during the period of FAO technical assistance; this has resulted in a mixed investment programme, as competing project ventures were scrutinised, selected (or rejected) and developed. It was important to focus the limited resources of the ABC upon projects that could later be duplicated elsewhere within the private sector, and which could be scaled to suit the demands of the market and the levels of investment capital available. There {{have been a number of}} elements within this broad strategy of development, including project implementation, training and field work. The project focused upon two industrial sub- sectors for which government planners and the private sector had shown some interest, viz. fresh flower exports and the provision of certified banana planting materials. The Consultant engaged to undertake the industrial survey for the fresh flower market showed that the domestic industry would face difficulties in international markets. Most cut flowers are currently sold locally. High transport costs, inadequate cold storage handling facilities at airports and the lack of freight space on international aircraft would make it difficult for domestic growers to compete. Climatic constraints within the country would also limit the supply of cut flowers. Negative conclusions are an intrinsic part of the planning process, and enable resources to be shifted into ventures where the elements of risk may be lower. This has been the case with the banana project, in which the Consultant showed that sufficient high-quality planting materials could be produced by domestic institutions or companies, thereby negating the need for imports from France or Costa Rica (the predominant suppliers). The development of a tissue culture laboratory for the production of planting material represents a firm choice for industrial investment. Several visits were made to the project by FAO Headquarters Technical Officers and by the Consultants selected for the field work. Apart from the normal management function that such visits may offer and support for the banana and cut-flower projects, the ABC was able to focus upon alternative industrial sub-sectors including dehydrated fruits, <b>tomato</b> <b>concentrate</b> and essential oils. The study tour scheduled for ABC staff to visit offices of the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF) in Africa was not undertaken. This remains a lost opportunity for the ABC.

40|$|This report adds to {{the ongoing}} vivid dispute {{on the fate of}} carotenes in tomato upon thermal processing. Although many papers dealing with changes in the raw {{tomatoes}} during industrial treatment have already appeared, data on the fate of finished, processed tomato products when they are additionally heated (e. g., when used in the household) is scarce. In this study, effects of heating and storage on a commercial, double <b>concentrated</b> <b>tomato</b> purée were examined spectrophotometrically. Our results indicate that upon exposing unopened cans with double <b>concentrated</b> <b>tomato</b> purée to thermal treatments between 100 and 135 °C during specific time intervals spectral profile of lycopene remained preserved. Likewise, a slight hypsochromic shift of lycopene peak III did not occur up to 135 °C. However, significant (20 %) initial loss of lycopene content was induced by thermal treatment for 20 min at 100 °C. During the more intensive treatments that followed the lycopene content was first leveling off and then slightly increased. After storage of thermally treated samples at - 18 °C the content of lycopene was found to increase. All these results suggest simultaneous working of several mechanisms: possible auto-oxidation and isomerization processes of carotenes taking place, in addition to the Maillard reaction and enhanced extractability of carotenes at increased temperatures. Results acquired from hexane solutions of samples treated at temperatures of 120 and 135 °C obtained at different time points, confirmed severe isomerization in organic solvent and/or photo-oxidative degradation of lycopene...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsumer {{acceptance}} of tomato products is highly correlated to their organoleptic characteristics and quality parameters such as color and texture. Textural properties of tomato juice {{can be attributed}} to the activity of pectinolytic enzymes such as pectinmethylesterase and polygalacturonase. High pressure processing has been proposed as an alternative physical method for intrinsic tomato enzymes inactivation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the quality characteristics of slightly <b>concentrated</b> <b>tomato</b> juice produced under high pressure conditions. Whole tomatoes (var. Red Sea) were pressure-treated at 250, 400, 500 or 600 MPa and 50 °C for 10 min. The processed tomatoes were then crushed, the peels and seeds were removed, and the resulted <b>tomato</b> juice was <b>concentrated</b> to 8. 5 °Brix. The viscosity, consistency and color of the concentrated juice were measured and compared to the corresponding properties of tomato juice, at the same concentration, produced under the traditional methods of both cold and hot break. High pressure processing did not affect the color of tomato juice at all pressure levels tested, while during hot break color deterioration was always observed. Pressure treatment at 400, 500 and 600 MPa led to products of higher viscosity. Increase in applied pressure resulted in an increase in product viscosity and improved consistency. High pressure processing can be used to produce minimally heat processed products with nutritional and sensorial characteristics comparable to that of fresh fruit. It provides a successful alternative to traditional thermal processing leading to products with desirable, or even predesigned, characteristics...|$|R
