5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> passes between the Sun and Earth, and when <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E

5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> and of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E

5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that the side of <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> and {{the planets}} are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive {{only when the}} Sun {{illuminates}} them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> had {{the nature of a}} mirror. Some of them recognized <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> as a ball too. Those parts of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} explanation is that <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
40|$|Phobos and Deimos, <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Mars, are {{interesting}} exploration destinations that offer extensibility of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) technologies.

This paper outlines the analysis performed to determine the mass impact of using <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Mars both as an intermediate staging point for exploration as well as for in-situ recourse utilization, namely propellant, to determine if <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> are viable options to include in the broader Mars surface exploration architecture...|$|R
5000|$|Galileo had {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Jupiter in 1609. Scheiner argued that {{what appeared to}} be spots on the sun were in fact clusters of small moons, thereby trying to deploy one of Galileo's own discoveries as an argument for the Aristotelian model. [...] In his Letters on Sunspots Galileo showed how sunspots were nothing like <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Jupiter, and the comparison was false. Scheiner claimed that the sunspots, with their irregular movements, were like <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Jupiter whose positions were similarly hard to predict. To counter this argument, Galileo published tables of predictions for the future position of <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Jupiter, so that astronomers could easily distinguish between the regular, predictable movements they followed with the ephemeral and irregular sunspots.|$|R

5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction that masses {{have for}} one another decreases inversely with {{the square of the}} distance of those masses from each other. As a result, the slightly greater attraction that <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> has for the side of Earth closest to <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> as compared to the part of the Earth opposite <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> results in tidal forces. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked in}} 1930 what {{inspired}} him for A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> Méliès credited Jules Verne's novels From the Earth to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1865) and Around <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1870). Cinema historians, the mid-20th-century French writer Georges Sadoul first among them, have frequently suggested H. G. Wells's The First Men in <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1901), a French translation {{of which was}} published {{a few months before}} Méliès made the film, as another likely influence. Sadoul argued that {{the first half of the}} film (up to the shooting of the projectile) is derived from Verne and that the second half (the travelers' adventures on and in <b>the</b> <b>moon)</b> is derived from Wells.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> The dust stays above <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
