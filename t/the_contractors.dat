5|$|Despite {{concerns}} over the potential cost, construction of the Memorial eventually came in at £400,000 under budget, in part because a number of <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> concerned carried out their work free of charge.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented {{serious problems with}} the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled. The response given by the Navy and <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E

50|$|Lawbuild has {{proposed}} a number of amendments to the JCT contract to protect the client further, with the top four being: to ensure <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> posts a 10% bond {{to cover the costs}} of finding a replacement <b>contractor</b> if <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> goes into liquidation, to ensure <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> obtains building regulations certificates before practical completion, to ensure <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> must accept design changes, and to ensure the employer can control the identities of <b>the</b> <b>contractor's</b> designers.|$|R
50|$|In April 2010, seismic {{retrofits}} {{were started}} on ramps leading to <b>the</b> Bridges. <b>The</b> <b>contractor</b> abruptly abandoned work in November 2010, with <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> stating {{they had not}} been paid and the County of Los Angeles finding fault in <b>the</b> <b>contractor's</b> work to-date.|$|R
5|$|But 1912 {{also brought}} {{some very good}} news for all the local river steamers, and the area in general. It was {{announced}} that another railway {{was going to be}} built, the Pacific Great Eastern which would run from Vancouver to Fort George and eventually beyond to the Peace River Country. Foley, Welch and Stewart would be <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> for this railway as well and they planned to build the grade along the upper Fraser River from Fort George to Soda Creek so that sternwheelers could be used to aid in its construction.|$|E
5|$|In Valdez, where Fluor had supervision, {{the work}} also was divided among several contractors. Site {{preparation}} {{work was done}} by Morrison-Knudsen. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, the tanker berths were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated the pipes. Fluor also had supervision {{of the construction of}} the pumping stations, which were generally built by <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> working on a specific section of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|Many navvies {{had been}} farm labourers from the Yorkshire Dales, North East England and the Fens, or {{had come for}} work from Scotland and Ireland. Drunkenness and {{fighting}} was such that Jos Midgeley, a railway police inspector, was hired for £1.25 per week to keep order. At one time he was attacked {{by a group of}} men, and at Wescoe Hill, two miles away {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wharfe, a riot occurred when <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> tried to cut off the beer supply to keep the men sober enough to work.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{competence}} and {{the intentions of}} <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> are primary sources of trust between <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> and <b>the</b> owner.|$|R
50|$|The JCT {{makes no}} {{distinction}} between work completed by subcontractors and work completed by <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> So <b>the</b> client can end up paying <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> for work certified and yet <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> may not pay the subcontractor, for example through insolvency. It may then be hard to work with that subcontractor to complete the work. In contrast in some US states, monies due to subcontractors must be held in trust by <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{umbrella}} company provides payroll {{on behalf}} of <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> and bills <b>the</b> agency (who in turn bills the client) for work completed by <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> <b>The</b> umbrella company provides all social contribution and tax payments (in some countries also [...] "PAYE, Pay As You Earn") and equivalents and National Insurance returns {{on behalf of}} <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Anglesey Central Railway Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict. c.cxxviii) {{founded the}} company, with capital of £120,000. The {{chairman}} was William Bulkeley Hughes, MP for Caernarfon and local railway prospector. The ceremonial first sod was cut on 11 September 1863, with construction starting {{the following year}} by <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> Dickson and Russell. With the line approaching Llangefni later in October 1864, LNWR engineers were authorised to build the main line junction at Gaerwen, at the Anglesey Central Railway's expense.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} felt <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> {{could not}} complete {{the program and}} instructed them to repay most of the $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics disputed this in Federal Claims court. The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and remain an issue of controversy, with suggestions of political expediency and scheming to be behind the action.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{building}} the dam received {{an average of}} 80¢ an hour; the payroll for the dam was among {{the largest in the}} nation. The workers were mainly pulled from Grant, Lincoln, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from <b>the</b> <b>contractors.</b> Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete. Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.|$|E
5000|$|An {{agreement}} between a chain and a <b>contractor.</b> <b>The</b> chain is bound within <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> {{and can be}} called out at will. In return, <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> provides passage for the chain out of the Abyss. Blood Seal contracts, that were made possible by Pandora, granted the ability never to age <b>the</b> <b>Contractor.</b> In illegal contracts, a clock-like seal appears somewhere on <b>the</b> <b>Contractor's</b> body, over their heart. Each time the chain's powers are drawn, the hand in the seal moves like on a clock. If a contract between <b>the</b> chain and <b>contractor</b> becomes void it will kill <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> Once <b>the</b> hand makes one full rotation, both <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> and <b>the</b> chain are dragged into the deepest level of the Abyss. Only Baskervilles are capable of forming a genuine legal contract, in which a seal similar to an illegal contract appears, except without the hand - thus allowing a contractor safe and complete access {{to the power of}} their chain.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays in the {{construction}} industry, the problems of non-performance by <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> have become a common thing faced by the client. This problems usually happens <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> failed to execute the according the contract. It has been a common issue in Malaysia when dealing with <b>contractor's</b> non-performance. Thus <b>the</b> client needs a protection in the event when <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> fails or defaults in its performance under the contract, such as abandonment or the works is of proof or any defects in the work appearing during the defects liability period. Contractor's performance guarantee is the feature or a management tool to handle the risk of non-performance by <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> Performance bond are introduced to ensure that contractor will honour and perform <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> diligently. If <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> failed to execute the work within the specification of the contract or <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> abandoned <b>the</b> work, the performance bond can be used towards the disbursement of expenses incurred by the employer in rectifying the defect. Performance bond is three party agreement between <b>the</b> employer, <b>contractor</b> and a third party (usually a bank or insurance company), who agrees to pay sum of money to the employer, the event of default by <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> in <b>the</b> construction contract. If <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> has performed in the contract or in the words, has carried out the work within the contract, the client needs to release back the performance bond...|$|R

5|$|Locomotives were used, {{the first}} one running by November 8, but this {{was too late to}} affect the outcome of the siege. The {{locomotives}} were not effective because they could not manage even the easy gradient from Balaclava to Kadikoi with more than a light load. Five second-hand locomotives, purchased by <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> from collieries and railway companies in England, are known to have arrived. Alliance and Victory were two small 0-6-0 saddle tanks built by E. B. Wilson & Co of Leeds in 1854/5; two from the London & North Western Railway, Nos 13 and 50, were 2-2-0 Bury-type passenger engines built by Benjamin Hick & Son of Bolton in 1838 and 1840; the fifth locomotive was Swan from the St Helens Canal & Railway Co, but its details remain obscure.|$|E
5|$|News {{of these}} {{conditions}} was relayed to Britain, mainly by William Howard Russell, special correspondent of The Times. Hearing the news, Samuel Morton Peto, {{one of the leading}} railway contractors of the day, offered with his partners Edward Betts and Thomas Brassey, to build at cost, without any contract or personal advantage, a railway to transport supplies from the port of Balaclava to the troops outside Sevastopol. They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava. The offer was accepted and <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> began to obtain supplies, to purchase or hire ships, and to recruit the men, who included specialists and navvies. The fleet set sail on December 21 and arrived at the beginning of February.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1889 a {{demonstration}} train comprising two carriages and two locomotives {{ran along the}} newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension {{and representatives of the}} local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet run through to Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> who had built the line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of the demonstration train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who had ridden the demonstration train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham.|$|E
50|$|Size and {{physical}} characteristics: The size {{and physical}} characteristics, such as adjustment capabilities, which is reviewed by both <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> and architect. <b>The</b> <b>contractor</b> has <b>the</b> most available information for comparing adjoining materials and equipment. <b>The</b> <b>contractor</b> {{also needs to}} know the size and weight of the equipment for lifting and handling considerations.|$|R
50|$|Another problem {{arises when}} <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> withholds from its {{subcontractors}} at {{a greater percentage}} than the owner has withheld from them. The owner is to pay retainage to <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> when substantial completion has occurred, however, in this abusive, over-withholding scenario, <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> will already have been paid {{a portion of the}} subcontractors' funds, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> will have to fund the balance of the payment from its own cash flow. This could cause a delay in the project closeout. <b>The</b> <b>contractor</b> may feel that it is more advantageous to keep the project incomplete, than by never being paid its retainage and making the argument that the subcontractors are therefore not due their portion of the retainage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} {{was aware that}} <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> {{had no knowledge of}} the information, and that <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> had no reason to attempt to obtain this information.|$|R
5|$|The bridge carries two {{lanes of}} European Route E39, {{also called the}} Coastal Highway, and one {{pedestrian}} and bicycle path, and connects the district of Nordhordland to Bergen. Plans for a bridge had existed since the 1960s, and after the decision to construct the bridge {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway in 1989, construction started in 1991. Total costs, including auxiliary roads, was NOK 910 million. Part of the contract payment was subject to a court case which <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> lost. The bridge opened on 22 September 1994, and remained a toll road until 31 December 2005. In 2014, it had an average daily traffic of 16,580 vehicles. There are plans to reinstate a toll on the bridge from 2013 to finance other road projects. The bridge is the second-longest in Norway, and the second pontoon bridge in Norway.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{occupy the}} former sound between Barry Island and the mainland. <b>The</b> <b>contractors</b> built dams to connect {{each end of}} the island to the mainland, drained or pumped the water from the site and {{excavated}} it. They used the material to level the area round the docks and for the core of breakwaters to protect the entrance. The works included a basin with gates at each end which served as a lock between the sea entrance and the docks, the dock walls and quays, coal loading equipment and railways to deliver coal from the mines to the docks. A second dock and second entrance lock were added in 1898. Barry Dock Offices were built in 1897-1900 by the architect Arthur E. Bell.|$|E
5|$|David Murray {{acquired}} {{control of}} Rangers in November 1988. Argyle House, a £4 million extension behind the Govan Stand, was opened in 1990. This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments {{was started in}} the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison {{to find a way}} of adding a third tier to the Main Stand. This was a highly complex process, as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. <b>The</b> <b>contractors</b> removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue that raised £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} a civil law responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> for project deficiencies resulting in reduced {{quality of the}} construction, i. e. not affecting its solidity. Primary obligation of <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> is to perform works in compliance with professional standards, the contract and the approved project. <b>The</b> <b>Contractor</b> cannot change <b>the</b> approved project at will, even when he has designed it. Hence, the question must be raised of the obligation of <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> to strictly abide by the project, assigned {{to him by the}} Authority, regardless of evident deficiencies of the Project and of his responsibility for performing works in compliance with the said project resulting in deficiencies in the construction, that is construction works. If the latter hypothesis is correct, then it must be established what deficiencies in the project fall under the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> (visible or hidden), i. e. the issue of dividing responsibility between the Project Designer and <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> in terms of the project deficiencies must be set up and solved. Finally, {{it is also important to}} define the realization of rights and duties of <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> in case <b>the</b> <b>Contractor</b> has to recede from the Project. In this paper the author tries to offer detail and complete answers to raised questions...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>contractor</b> {{stated that}} they will {{continue}} without the additional requested money if FDOT denies it, but it may end up as a court case as <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> seeks it later.

5|$|Groves {{instituted a}} series of reforms. He {{installed}} phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters, demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters to sites reporting shortages. He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, {{the worst of the}} crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodations and facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete. Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000 ($ with inflation), of which $1,347,991,000 ($ with inflation), or about 80 per cent, were fixed-fee contracts.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2014, a {{spending}} bill {{passed by the}} House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29-$34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million. The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{architect}} and <b>contractor</b> {{work together in}} a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. The building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. <b>The</b> <b>contractor</b> leads <b>the</b> joint venture so in supervising the subs, the architect might defer to <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> <b>The</b> architect bears the same risk {{as they do in}} the traditional approach but has more control in IPD, even if they were to defer to <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Changes clauses {{give the}} {{government}} the power unilaterally to order contractual modifications; in return, the contract specifies {{that if the}} parties are unable to agree on compensation to be received by <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> for <b>the</b> modified work, <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment. The goal of an equitable adjustment is to place <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> in <b>the</b> position {{he or she would}} have been in had the change not been encountered.

5000|$|Several {{alternatives}} {{exist to}} standard retainage provisions {{that provide the}} same benefits and protections. For example, parties can agree to establish a trust account. A trust account provides <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> with some control over its money, {{even if it is}} being held by the owner. In a trust account, retainage is withheld by the owner, placed in a trust account with a trustee that has a fiduciary relationship to <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> <b>The</b> trustee can invest the retainage at <b>the</b> <b>contractor's</b> direction, thereby allowing <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> to [...] "use" [...] the retained funds that normally would sit idle in an escrow account.|$|R
