5|$|Sasuke was not {{included}} in Kishimoto's original concept of the Naruto manga. While discussing the future of the series, his editor advised him to add a rival character for the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, so he created Sasuke.

Kishimoto also drew inspiration from his own relationship with his twin brother, Seishi. Since childhood, Masashi had worried about Seishi when he faced failures, such as in high school or college, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him.|$|E

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Within {{three weeks}} of the liberation of Mauthausen, Wiesenthal had {{prepared}} a list of around a hundred names of suspected Nazi war criminals—mostly guards, camp commandants, {{and members of the}} Gestapo—and presented it to a War Crimes office of the American Counterintelligence Corps at Mauthausen. He worked as an interpreter, accompanying officers who were carrying out arrests, though he was still very frail. When Austria was partitioned in July 1945, Mauthausen fell into the Soviet-occupied zone, so the American War Crimes Office was moved to Linz. Wiesenthal went with them, and was housed in a displaced persons camp. He served as vice-chairman of the area's Jewish Central Committee, an organisation that attempted to arrange basic care for Jewish refugees and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people gather information about their missing family members.|$|E
