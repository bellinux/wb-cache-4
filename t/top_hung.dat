It was fashioned of crystal to the well-known shape of the Crux-ansata, or the emblem of life of the Egyptians; the rod, the cross and the loop combined in one. From side to side of this loop ran golden wires, and on these were strung gems of three colours, glittering diamonds, sea-blue sapphires, and blood-red rubies, while to the fourth wire, that at the <b>top,</b> <b>hung</b> four little golden bells.|$|E
60|$|I {{marched on}} that spoor {{for twenty minutes}} or so, till {{we came to a}} patch of bush that sloped {{downwards}} to a river-bed. Right to this river I followed it, till I reached the edge of a big pool that was still full of water, although the river itself had gone dry. Here I stood looking at the spoor and consulting with Saduko as to whether the beast could have swum the pool, for the tracks that went to its very verge had become confused and uncertain. Suddenly our doubts were ended, since out of a patch of dense bush which we had passed--for it had played the common trick of doubling back on its own spoor--appeared the buffalo, a huge bull, that halted on three legs, my bullet having broken one of its thighs. As to its identity there was no doubt, since on, or rather from, its right horn, which was cleft apart at the <b>top,</b> <b>hung</b> the remains of Umbezi's moocha.|$|E

60|$|But I {{forgot all}} this, when, nearly at the top, I was thrown {{up the hill}} of the stairs {{as if it had}} {{suddenly}} become downhill.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{to operate}} a sliding door is called sliding door gear. There are two standard types, <b>top</b> <b>hung</b> or bottom rolling systems.

50|$|The factory office, {{relocated}} {{to the north}} of the factory from its original location to the west of the siding, is a timber framed building, lowset on stumps with timber <b>top</b> <b>hung</b> sash windows and a flat fibrous cement wall cladding with timber cover strips. It has a corrugated iron gambrel roof with eaves extended over the south-west elevation.|$|E
60|$|The tops were large, {{and were}} railed about with {{what had once}} been {{octagonal}} net-work, all now in sad disrepair. These <b>tops</b> <b>hung</b> overhead like three ruinous aviaries, in one of which was seen, perched, on a ratlin, a white noddy, a strange fowl, so called from its lethargic, somnambulistic character, being frequently caught by hand at sea. Battered and mouldy, the castellated forecastle seemed some ancient turret, long ago taken by assault, and then left to decay. Toward the stern, two high-raised quarter galleries--the balustrades here and there covered with dry, tindery sea-moss--opening out from the unoccupied state-cabin, whose dead-lights, for all the mild weather, were hermetically closed and calked--these tenantless balconies hung over the sea {{as if it were the}} grand Venetian canal. But the principal relic of faded grandeur was the ample oval of the shield-like stern-piece, intricately carved with the arms of Castile and Leon, medallioned about by groups of mythological or symbolical devices; uppermost and central of which was a dark satyr in a mask, holding his foot on the prostrate neck of a writhing figure, likewise masked.|$|R

60|$|It was {{a dreary}} place; Guy began now {{to see the}} other side of South Africa. Though he had left England in autumn, it was spring-time at the Cape, and the winter drought had parched up all the grass, leaving the bare red dust in the roads or streets as dry and desolate as the sand of the desert. The town itself {{consisted}} of some sixty melancholy and distressful houses, bare, square, and flat-roofed, standing unenclosed along a dismal high-road, and with that congenitally shabby look, in spite of their newness, which seems to belong by nature to all southern buildings. Some stagnant pools alone remained to attest the presence after rain of a roaring brook, the pits in whose dried-up channel they now occupied; over their <b>tops</b> <b>hung</b> the faded foliage of a few dust-laden trees, struggling hard for life with the energy of despair against depressing circumstances. It was a picture that gave Guy a sudden attack of pessimism; if THIS was the El Dorado towards which he was going, he earnestly wished himself back again once more, forgery or no forgery, among the breezy green fields of dear old England.|$|R

These are spaced at regular intervals. A second less ornate entrance is situated on Denham Street. On both Denham and Sturt streets above the base plinth are white painted <b>top</b> <b>hung</b> aluminum windows situated at regular intervals. Original timber four-segmented lights cap them. The aluminum windows are sympathetic to the original double hung timber windows.|$|E

5000|$|A multi-competitor match type {{in which}} wrestlers are {{eliminated}} until only one is left. Typical battle royals begin with 20 or so {{participants in the}} ring, who are then eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor (this is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Shawn Michaels rule", due to the 1995 Royal Rumble, in which he was thrown over the <b>top</b> rope, <b>hung</b> on to the top rope and only had one foot land on the floor).

50|$|The {{administration}} building is {{situated on the}} highest point of the site in the south-western corner adjacent to the railway bridge over Young Street. The building {{is divided into two}} sections. Adjacent to Young Street the single storey rendered masonry section has articulated engaged piers to its southern elevation, a hipped corrugated iron roof surmounted by two small ventilators, quad guttering, later sliding aluminium windows and boarded soffits in line with the rafters. The two storey rendered masonry section attached along its northern also has a hipped corrugated iron roof and quad guttering but has a flat soffit with timber cover strips and no evidence of articulated piers. It has a rendered masonry string course below the window line. The windows comprise groups of six <b>top</b> <b>hung</b> sashes to the western elevation with later aluminium sliding windows generally throughout the remainder of the building.|$|E
50|$|The hall is {{constructed}} from dressed stone with a hipped slate roof. The main frontage {{of the building}} faces south and is composed of three storeys and a seven window range, the windows are mostly 20th century <b>top</b> <b>hung</b> casements with moulded surrounds and keystones. The front also has a central pediment and the main entrance has an open Doric three bay colonnade. The main colonnade leads off {{the west side of}} the building and is composed of eight bays with Doric columns. The colonnade leads on to the taller orangerey which has three tall round arched openings with keystones, all the openings in the orangerey and the colonnade have now been filled in as they have been converted to apartments. The stables stand 200 metres to the north east and are built of ashlars and coursed rubble with a hipped stone slate roof.|$|E
50|$|Basically the kettuvallam was {{designed}} to transport cargo and as such many design changes {{had to be made}} to make it a tourist vehicle. The height of the roof was increased to get sufficient headroom. A plank was laid all through the length for ease of walking and comfortable seating, to reduce the disadvantages of the curved shape of the hull. Windows and other openings were provided for light, airflow and view. The entrance is provided in the centre of the linear axis with a <b>top</b> <b>hung</b> panel.Most of the latest designs have incorporated three bedrooms with toilets, a living space and kitchen. Of course, there are variations. Some have a lesser number of bedrooms but with a large living space and maybe a deck balcony at the roof level. Normally, the platforms that cantilever from the hull are used as balconies. Innovative changes have been made to accommodate modern fittings. For fixing the toilet seats, shower tray and ceramic floor finish a concrete slab is laid at the floor level. These toilettes are made of steel cabinets with a network of steel meshes on which beneficial bacteria are grown {{with the help of a}} catalyst named actizyme. These bacteria feed upon human excreta and produce a harmless germ free colourless byproduct. The soil outlets of the toilet seats are taken through the hull and let out to the flowing water beneath. The use of bio-toilette is common nowadays. Thus the backwater canals are not polluted. The water for use is stored in a plastic tank kept at the top portion of the main body connecting to the kitchen and toilets. The pipes, tank and other synthetic materials are covered with coir or panambu to maintain the aesthetic quality of the eco-friendly materials.|$|E
50|$|Gukanov’s {{combined}} bath brooms are {{a combination}} of oak, linden, birch and juniper twigs, with the juniper twigs usually hidden within the broom. It is usually stored in the attic, {{laid out on the}} floor in several rows on top of one and other, with dry brooms at the bottom and wet brooms at the <b>top,</b> or <b>hung</b> during rainy weather. This storage method is troublesome, but it keeps the broom flat, {{in the shape of a}} fan, and easy to use. Storing it in the dark helps it keep its aroma, color, and freshness, as the leaves lose their color and smell when exposed to light.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{cold climate}} regions, where natural {{ventilation}} is not preferred during winter, natural ventilation is always preferred in Hong Kong for cooling {{because of the}} subtropical climate. It also provides better indoor environment quality and energy conservation. Natural ventilation performance of a residential unit is affected by internal as well as external factors. External factors are often subject to constraints {{beyond the control of}} site planners and architects. Internal factors include opening configurations and window types, which site planners and architects are free to design the way they deem proper. However, little information is available about their precise impact. An earlier study by the authors on opening configurations identified the best and the worst out of twelve configurations. The best was with cross ventilation and the worst was with single-sided ventilation. In this study, {{the focus is on the}} influence of window types. CFD simulations were performed based on the best and worst opening configurations, different building orientations, and varying wind conditions, to evaluate the influence of different window types on natural ventilation performance using the mean age of air (MAA) as the criteria. Four window types were studied: side hung, <b>top</b> <b>hung,</b> full end-slider, and half end-slider windows. Evaluation results indicate that for cross-opening configurations natural ventilation performance was better with full end slider and side hung type windows. For single-sided opening configurations, side hung windows performed much better than the other three types. It can be concluded that better natural ventilation performance can be achieved by the use of side hung windows. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

60|$|At Mallicolo, on August 20, {{a horrible}} sight {{presented}} {{itself to the}} eyes of the two explorers when they walked inland with about eighteen most obliging and courteous natives--an open space with four hollowed trunks of trees surrounding two stones, the trees carved into the shape of grotesque human heads, and among them, a sort of temple, made of sloping bamboos and pandanus leaves meeting at the <b>top,</b> from whence <b>hung</b> a dead man, with his face painted in stripes of red and yellow, procured, it was thought, from the pollen of flowers. There was not enough comprehension of the language to make out the meaning of all this.|$|R

The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth {{as a sign of}} humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time. [...] Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered. [...] Valances used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the <b>top,</b> from which <b>hung</b> streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.|$|R
50|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted {{at an angle to}} the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings. Whenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on <b>top.</b> If <b>hung</b> vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|R
60|$|The {{procession}} was led off by two venerable-looking savages, each {{provided with}} a spear, {{from the end of}} which streamed a pennon of milk-white tappa. After them went several youths, bearing aloft calabashes of poee-poee; and followed in their turn by four stalwart fellows, sustaining long bamboos, from the <b>tops</b> of which <b>hung</b> suspended, at least twenty feet from the ground, large baskets of green bread-fruit. Then came a troop of boys, carrying bunches of ripe bananas, and baskets made of woven leaflets of cocoa-nut boughs, filled with the young fruit of the tree, the naked shells, stripped of their husks, peeping forth from the verdant wicker-work that surrounded them. Last of all came a burly islander, holding over his head a wooden trencher, in which lay disposed the remnants of our midnight feast, hidden from view, however, by a covering of bread-fruit leaves.|$|R
60|$|When the {{shepherd}} was dragged to the dungeons he begged the guards {{to leave him}} alone a little while that he might look down into the pit of scythes; perhaps he might after all {{make up his mind}} to say 'To your good health' to the king. So the guards left him alone and he stuck up his long stick near the well, hung his cloak round the stick and put his hat on the <b>top.</b> He also <b>hung</b> his knapsack up inside the cloak so that it might seem to have some body within it. When this was done he called out to the guards and said that he had considered the matter but after all he could not make up his mind to say what the king wished. The guards came in, threw the hat and cloak, knapsack and stick all down the well together, watched to see how they put out the light at the bottom and came away, thinking that now there really was an end of {{the shepherd}}. But he had hidden in a dark corner and was laughing to himself all the time.|$|R

In May 2010, the track [...] "Intro" [...] was used by the BBC in its coverage of the 2010 general election. This led to the band playing the track on an episode of Newsnight. The track was also played before the UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016 matches at stadiums in Poland, Ukraine, and France and featured during the end of Top Gear Season 19 Episode 6 (Africa Special Part 1). Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and Sander van Doorn's 2012 single Project T, which launched the official Tomorrowland 2012 aftermovie, contains samples from [...] "Intro"; van Doorn had earlier released a remix of the song in 2010.
