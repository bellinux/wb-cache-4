While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father (Harold Ramis) is excited. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give their relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.|$|E

Cowen says Paul Krugman's The Conscience of a Liberal (2007) puts the [...] "cart before the horse" [...] in asking for high marginal tax rates, unionization, and an egalitarian distribution of income and wealth. The policies worked in the 1950s precisely because the real income growth was <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> them. Cowen argues that the failure to recognize the stagnation has led to poor policy ideas from the right (such as [...] "revenue generating tax cuts") and the left (redistribution of incomes). Cowen laments the [...] "exaggeration" [...] of both sides and the influence of political lobbying on economic policy. The growth in government, he says, was affordable during the period of lowhanging fruit, and the advances in transportation, industrial production, electronic communications and scientific management even facilitated it.|$|E
