5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during a demonstration of <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased {{in proportion to the}} size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|Orville succeeded to the {{presidency}} of <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> Company upon Wilbur's death. Sharing Wilbur's distaste for business but not his brother's executive skills, Orville sold the company in 1915.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> {{brothers}} {{won their}} initial case against Curtiss in February 1913 when a {{judge ruled that}} ailerons were covered under the patent. The Curtiss company appealed the decision.|$|E
5000|$|A young married couple, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights,</b> {{wake up one}} day to {{the sounds}} of construction. When they {{get a good look at}} the world around them, they find {{everything}} has stopped. A crew of blue-clad construction workers are busy removing their furniture and replacing it with new. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> run outside to find things being rebuilt that have already existed. The workers set up a crash, and distribute litter in <b>the</b> streets. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> start to go in the direction of the voice barking out orders to the workers until the voice tells them to chase <b>the</b> <b>Wrights.</b>|$|R
5|$|Curtiss {{refused to}} pay license fees to <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> and sold an {{airplane}} equipped with ailerons to the Aeronautic Society of New York in 1909. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> filed a lawsuit, beginning a years-long legal conflict. They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U.S. exhibitions, including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan. The Curtiss people derisively suggested that if someone jumped {{in the air and}} waved his arms, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> would sue.|$|R
50|$|Jackson's nephew, Adam Wright, is also {{a country}} music singer-songwriter. Adam and his wife, Shannon, perform {{together}} as a duo called <b>The</b> <b>Wrights.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> co-wrote two songs and sang harmony vocals on Jackson's What I Do album.|$|R
5|$|As part of WS-202A, {{a design}} for a {{high-speed}} (Mach 3+) aerial target for use in testing the F-108's weapons system was proposed. <b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> Air Development Center requested the designation XQ-11 for the target design; the request was denied due to the early stage of development, and the F-108 program was cancelled before further work was undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially motivated {{by the prospect of}} military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. <b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state {{to ratify the}} Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide prohibition. Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required to amend the U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide Prohibition on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. <b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|R
50|$|As part of <b>the</b> larger <b>Wright</b> brothers' patent cases, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> {{actually}} won {{monetary damages}} in U.S. courts for Paulhan's public performances that day.|$|R
50|$|Three years {{previous}} to the June Bugs flight, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> {{had made}} flights {{of up to}} 24 miles (38 km) without official witnesses. However <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> would have been required to install wheels and dispense with a catapult launch {{to compete for the}} 1908 prize.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> Company was {{incorporated}} on November 22, 1909. The brothers sold their patents {{to the company}} for $100,000 and also received one-third of the shares in a million dollar stock issue and a 10 percent royalty on every airplane sold. With Wilbur as president and Orville as vice president, the company set up a factory in Dayton and a flying school/test flight field at Huffman Prairie; the headquarters office was in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} written for Balliett {{classroom}} intended to deal with real-world issues. Balliett values children's ideas and wrote the book specifically to highlight that. Chasing Vermeer has won several awards, including the Edgar and the Agatha. In 2006, the sequel entitled <b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> 3 was published, followed by The Calder Game in 2008,.|$|E
5|$|Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, {{located in}} Dayton, and {{partially}} named for <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> Brothers from Ohio who are generally credited with inventing the airplane, employs 27,400 residents. The Air Force estimates that Wright-Patterson’s annual economic {{impact on the}} Dayton region is $5.1 billion.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it became}} clear that an {{off-the-shelf}} engine with the required power-to-weight ratio was not available in the U.S. for their first engine-driven Flyer, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> turned to Taylor for the job. He designed and built the aluminum-copper water-cooled engine in only six weeks, based partly on rough sketches provided by <b>the</b> <b>Wrights.</b> <b>The</b> cast aluminum block and crankcase weighed 152 lb and were produced at either Miami Brass Foundry or the Buckeye Iron and Brass Works, near Dayton, Ohio. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> needed an engine with at least [...] The engine that Taylor built produced 12.|$|R
5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> {{had received}} sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged {{on until the}} patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In <b>the</b> U.S. <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> made {{an agreement with the}} Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat. Promoters of approved shows paid fees to <b>the</b> <b>Wrights.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and <b>the</b> <b>wright</b> Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|Dayton is {{also noted}} for its {{association}} with aviation; the city {{is home to the}} National Museum of the United States Air Force and is the birthplace of Orville Wright. Other well-known individuals born in the city include poet Paul Laurence Dunbar and entrepreneur John H. Patterson. Dayton is also known for its many patents, inventions, and inventors that have come from the area, most notably <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers' invention of powered flight. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 mid-sized metropolitan area in the nation for economic development. Also in 2010, Dayton was named {{one of the best places}} in the United States for college graduates to find a job.|$|E
5|$|Following the flight, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Armstrong and {{his wife}} {{to take part in}} a 24-day {{goodwill}} tour of South America. Also on the tour, which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities, were Dick Gordon, George Low, their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong impressed dignitaries by greeting them in their local language, Guarani; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born Alberto Santos-Dumont, who was regarded as having beaten <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers with the first flying machine with his 14-bis.|$|E
50|$|The broad {{protection}} {{intended by}} this patent succeeded when <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> won patent infringement lawsuits against Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators who devised ailerons to emulate lateral control {{described in the}} patent and demonstrated by <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> in their 1908 public flights. U.S. courts decided that ailerons were also covered by the patent.|$|R
50|$|Witkowski {{and his men}} take Anna's friend Sarah and her baby, Julian, hostage. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> {{agree to}} meet Witkowski at <b>the</b> house <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> were renovating, where they've been hiding. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> inform Halden of the plan and rig the house in {{preparation}} for their meeting. Witkowski falls through the floor and Tom puts nails through Marshall's feet. Khan and his men arrive at the house, {{to the surprise of}} everyone. Halden arrives at the house and kills one of Khan's men with his car as Sarah and her baby escape, but Halden is knocked unconscious. A game of cat and mouse ensues throughout the house between Khan and his men, Witkowski and Marshall, and <b>the</b> <b>Wrights.</b> Khan's other man is killed by Tom and Khan kills Witkowski. Tom fights with Khan, who is about to kill Tom when a shot from Marshall, directed at them both, kills Khan. Anna is nearly choked to death by Marshall until a revived Halden enters the house and shoots Marshall dead. The movie ends with the house burning to <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>Wrights</b> moving out of their apartment, and Anna telling Tom that she is pregnant.|$|R

5|$|He {{ranks as}} an early pioneer of aviation, having built and flown his own inventions at a time roughly {{contemporaneous}} with <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers during the heady, pre-World War I era of aeroplane vogue. He was accepted into the exclusive pioneers' club of Early Birds of Aviation soon after its 1928 foundation, and he was formally added to the Kansas Aviation Museum's Hall of Fame in 1997. A single example of Longren's aircraft – the 1914 pusher biplane that he crashed in Abilene – remains on permanent exhibit at the Kansas Museum of History.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell {{was awarded}} the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's {{research}} laboratory, {{one of the first}} of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. <b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.|$|E
5|$|Neil Armstrong's {{personal}} preference kit carried {{a piece of}} wood from <b>the</b> <b>Wright</b> brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> {{began using}} Huffman Prairie in 1904 with the {{permission}} of the field's owner, Dayton banker Torrence Huffman. Its location along an interurban rail line from the brothers' hometown of Dayton provided them with easy access. <b>The</b> <b>Wrights</b> made about 150 flights at the field in 1904-1905, leading to development of <b>the</b> 1905 <b>Wright</b> Flyer III, which they considered to be the first practical airplane. This aircraft has been restored, and is now displayed at the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton.|$|R

5|$|The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{had created}} the {{national}} side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem. The white kit worn by the national team {{was taken from the}} kit used at Rugby School. Alfred Wright, an employee of the Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction. <b>The</b> <b>Wright</b> design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s. It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.|$|E
