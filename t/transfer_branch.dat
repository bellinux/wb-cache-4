30|$|Synchronous {{operation}} of the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> in a hybrid HVDC breaker (HHB) [36] has been proposed to reduce the adverse effects on the VSC-based DC grid from a DCB reclosing operation under a permanent fault [37]. Specifically, all fully-controlled fast-power electronic switches in the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> are energized {{to carry out the}} reclosing operation synchronously. Then the main branch is conducted if no fault is detected. Conversely, once a permanent fault is detected, all the fully-controlled fast-power electronic switches in the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> will be immediately de-energized synchronously to interrupt the fault current. We call this the traditional sequential auto-reclosing strategy in this paper, and with its help, the fault current can be interrupted immediately if a permanent fault is detected. However, potential negative impacts such as erroneous protection, line-insulation failure, and even damage to power electronic devices will occur when the fault is temporary.|$|E

30|$|The use of {{overhead}} lines for power transmission {{in the future}} high-voltage and large-capacity voltage-source converter (VSC)-based direct current (DC) grid will significantly increase the probability of temporary faults. To eliminate potential adverse impacts such as erroneous protection, line-insulation failure, and even damage to power electronic devices resulting from a DC breaker reclosing operation with the traditional sequential auto-reclosing strategy, a novel sequential auto-reclosing strategy for hybrid HVDC breakers (HHBs) in VSC-based DC grids is proposed. This strategy {{is based on the}} step-by-step operation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> in the HHB. As a result, du/dt resulting from the HHB reclosing operation is greatly reduced, and therefore those potential negative impacts can be eliminated. Several other advantages are also presented. The feasibility and validity of the proposed strategy are verified in a four-terminal annular VSC-based DC grid electromagnetic transient model.|$|E

To complement the existing research, this paper presents a case study of the modeling and evaluation of advanced branch predictors using full-system simulation of Java workloads running on a commercial operating system. The contributions of this paper are: (1) The presentation of a full system simulation framework to model, simulate and evaluate the performance of a set of advanced prediction schemes on emerging Java workloads; (2) An analysis of the performance and design complexity of advanced branch predictors in the presence of full system code; (3) An accurate modeling of user/kernel branch aliasing on a wide range of branch predictors. 1...|$|E
30|$|The {{control signals}} omitted here for PEMs in the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> with both {{strategies}} {{are the same}} as those shown in Fig.  13. In Fig.  17 a, the port voltage of HHB 34 in the positive-pole line with the traditional strategy decreases to zero vertically, while that with the proposed strategy gradually reduces to zero with a ramp, which is the same as in Fig.  14 a. As shown in Fig.  17 b–f, branch currents of the same HHB 34, faulty positive-pole line voltage, faulty positive-pole line current, healthy positive-pole voltage, and positive-pole outlet currents of the four converter stations with the traditional strategy show larger oscillations than those with the proposed strategy. It is worth noting that large voltage oscillations with peak values up to about 1.68 p.u. and 1.65 p.u. of the rated DC voltage respectively occur in the faulty positive-pole line shown in Fig.  17 c and healthy positive-pole line between S 1 and S 2 shown in Fig.  17 e with the traditional strategy, while no obvious voltage oscillation is observed in the same lines with the proposed strategy. In Fig.  17 g, no energy is absorbed by the MOV in a cascaded unit with the traditional strategy, while the energy absorbed with the proposed strategy is within tolerance of the MOV and can be ignored when compared to that in the same HHB 34 breaking procedure.|$|E
