40|$|A {{diode laser}} array {{comprises}} a substrate of a semiconductor material having first and second opposed surfaces. On the first surface is a plurality of spaced gain sections and a separate distributed Bragg reflector passive waveguide {{at each end of}} each gain section and optically connecting <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections. Each gain section includes a cavity therein wherein charge carriers are generated and recombine to generate light which is confined in the cavity. Also, the cavity, which is preferably a quantum well cavity, provides both a high differential gain and potentially large depth of loss modulation. Each waveguide has a wavelength which is preferably formed by an extension of the cavity of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections and a grating. The grating has a period which provides a selective feedback of light into <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections to supporting lasing, which allows some of the light to be emitted from the waveguide normal {{to the surface of the}} substrate and which allows optical coupling of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections. Also, <b>the</b> grating period provides an operating wavelength which is on the short wavelength side of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> period of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections required for laser oscillation. An RF pulse is applied so as to maximize the magnitude of the loss modulation and <b>the</b> differential <b>gain</b> in <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections. <b>The</b> array is operated by applying a DC bias to all <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections at a level just below the threshold of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections to only one of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections which raises the bias in all of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections to a level that causes all of <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> sections to oscillate.

Zutphen and Deventer remained in Spanish control until their capture in 1591 by Maurice of Nassau.|$|E

5|$|Under Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, <b>the</b> <b>gains</b> in {{the east}} against the now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902, and in 904 Thessaloniki, the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval {{weakness}} of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.|$|E
5|$|After {{putting an}} end to the {{internal}} strife, Basil II launched a counter-campaign against the Arabs in 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and <b>the</b> <b>gains</b> of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. Basil won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south.

5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold <b>the</b> <b>gains</b> made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but <b>the</b> <b>gains</b> made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the bulge. 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division.

Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare.

After the battle, Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated <b>the</b> <b>gains</b> made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
5|$|Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied {{shipping}} off the American Atlantic coast.

Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942. An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein. On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid, demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.|$|E
