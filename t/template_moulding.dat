40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} with high specific surface areas and high pore volumes {{are of interest}} for applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This study describes the use of novel preparative methods for obtaining nanostructured samarium-doped ceria (SDC) {{with a view to}} its application as an anode material in SOFCs. The strategy employed in this work was based on the nanocasting concept. Template {{materials with}} a polymer, carbon or silica framework are first obtained using a self-assembly process. These materials have long range networks of ordered mesopore channels and so act as <b>templating</b> <b>moulds.</b> From a three step procedure of precursor impregnation, in-situ formation of SDC by calcination and template removal, SDC with the inverse pore structure of the template is created. Novel methods for producing such SDC materials were applied and the products evaluated. As silica templates have wide ranging applications involving exposure to high temperatures -not least in nanocasting- it was desirable to understand the thermal stability of these materials over a range of temperatures. A systematic study was conducted on three representative silica templates. An inherent problem in nanocasting from silica templates is retention of residual silica after the template removal step. A detailed investigation into these alternative wet chemistry procedures was undertaken. To circumvent the silica problem completely, a number of alternative templates made of mesoporous carbon were considered. A range of ordered mesoporous carbons were prepared and evaluated as templates. To provide a comparator for the ordered SDC materials, a simple combustion method was used to prepare an SDC product without the influence of a structure directing template. The techniques of TEM, SEM-EDX, UV–Vis spectroscopy, MAS-NMR, PXRD and gas physisorption were used to characterise the physical and chemical properties of the products in the bulk and at the nanoscale...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} a mass production method using nanoporous Anodized Aluminum Oxide (AAO) <b>templates</b> as <b>mould</b> insert tools {{that are used}} to structure large area polymer surfaces by a micro injection moulding process. SEM and water contact angle measurements served to evaluate the effect of nanostructures on surface properties. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured on nano-structured and ultra-smooth surfaces of polymer parts. Experimental results indicated that nano-pillar features sized from ~ 100 nm to 250 nm were easily replicated on these same polymer surfaces. The contact angles varied from 3 o to 9 o. The nanoporous AAO templates were able to retain their pore integrity very well for ~ 80 injection moulding cycles: this suggests they they could be a potential mould tool for large area patterning of polymer surfaces. The endothelial cell culture analysis indicates that cell growth was not significantly affected by nano-topography compared to the smooth surfaces (baseline RA ~ 6 nm) and both surfaces had equally good cell adhesion...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a surface}} with {{patterned}} wettability {{by means of}} surface structuring, rather than through modifying the surface chemistry, was developed. The device presented in this thesis {{was inspired by the}} Namib Desert Bettle, which collects water from the fog by having hydrophilic spots surrounded by hydrophobic wax-coated regions on its back. Besides water collection, controlling the wetting behaviour locally on the surface may find applications within droplet-based microfluidics, or fabrication of DNA, protein or cell microarrays. Spatial wetting contrast was achieved through replica moulding of the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), using a copper and/or the epoxy-based SU- 8 photoresist surface as a template. Different types of surface roughness was produced and characterized on polycrystalline copper, through etching, oxidation, electrodeposition, or a combination. Regions with no surface roughness was patterned on the <b>template</b> <b>moulds</b> through conventional UV-photolithography processing of SU- 8. The PDMS replicas were then tested for the ability to capture water droplets selectively on the patterned spots. Through characterization of the surface roughness by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), copper plates etched with a solution of CuCl 2 and HCl produced the highest amount of surface roughness, with longer etching times leading to increased surface roughness. To characterize the hydrophobicity, the contact angle was measured for droplets deposited on the rough PDMS surfaces. Through surface structuring, the contact angle was increased from 101. 8 ± 3. 6 &# 9702; for a flat surface, to 154. 7 ± 5. 3 &# 9702; for the PDMS surface with the highest roughness. The polarity of surface roughness was also found {{to play an important role}} in the wetting behaviour, with a higher number of peaks than valleys being preferable. The fabricated PDMS surfaces showed spatial wetting contrast, as demonstrated in the cover photo. The device needs further optimization in terms of increasing the hydrophobicity of the rough regions, as well as changing the pattern geometries. However, the discoveries made in this study may be useful for further development and integration with droplet-moving mechanisms, for future lab-on-a-chip applications within medical diagnostics or chemical analysis. </p...|$|R

30|$|Currently, {{the use of}} nanostructured <b>templates</b> or <b>moulds</b> {{has become}} a {{preferred}} way to build ordered structures organized over areas of hundreds of square micrometer in size. By depositing/casting the desired materials inside the templates, large arrays can be made efficiently and economically [1]. One of the simplest and most widely used materials for this purpose is opaline. It consists of spheres of glass, minerals, or plastic stacked in close-packed arrays. These arrays can either be produced naturally or artificially by induced self-assembly, for instance, by capillary forces [2]. Another method is {{through the use of}} polymer stamps. They are fabricated by casting on lithographically generated rigid moulds [3] or made using self-assembled copolymers deposited on flat substrates [4, 5]. Another strategy to generate the template material is the use of anodized aluminum oxide membranes (AAOs). This type of membrane is usually prepared by the anodization of aluminum foils or thin films to obtain a honeycomb arrangement of pores perpendicular to the exposed surface [6 – 8]. This material has been used to build metal-insulator-metal nanocapacitor arrays for energy storage [9] and also to design highly specific and sensitive detectors for molecules of biological origin such as troponin, a protein marker for individuals with a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction [10].|$|R

50|$|As the fritware paste lacked {{plasticity}} and {{was difficult}} {{to work on the}} wheel, vessels were seldom made in one piece. Instead they were formed in separate sections that were allowed to dry and then stuck together using the fritware paste. This additive technique meant that there was a tendency for the final vessels to have slightly angular shapes. Dishes were almost certainly made using a mould attached to a potter's wheel. A lump of fritware paste would have been rolled out into a sheet much like when a cook rolls out pastry. The sheet would have been placed on the mould to form the inside of the dish. The underside of the dish would have been shaped using a <b>template</b> as the <b>mould</b> was rotated on the wheel. When the paste was partly dry the foliate rim would have been sculptured by hand.|$|R
40|$|Using {{sacrificial}} templates {{to create}} 3 D structures is commonly employed in various {{fields such as}} tissue engineering and water remediation to create complex and high surface area scaffolds. Herein, several sacrificial templating techniques are tried, tested, and evaluated and several methods for creating 3 D porous material are discussed, including: solvent casting particulate leaching (SCPL) and simple sugar and salt leaching. The porous material is then integrated with polymer soft lithography patterning to create a single functionally graded adhesive (FGA) material to use in dry adhesive applications. The use of a soft foam backing layer helps to improve the compliance and flexibility of the adhesive pad, thus enhancing peel tolerance, buckling, and deflection and vibration resistance. A dry FGA based on film-terminated silicone foam is developed utilizing the polymer foam's capacity to absorb large amounts of energy and so deliver high adhesion and peel resistance. The fabrication technique is based on simple sugar cube templating of common elastomers, followed by film termination of the polymer cubes using the same material. Dependencies of the pull-off adhesive force and energy release rate on preload and foam thickness are systematically investigated {{through a series of}} axisymmetric indentation/de-bonding tests. The contribution of the foam backing layer to the overall compliance and adhesion is analysed and discussed. The developed elastic film-terminated structure strongly enhances the pull-off force and work of adhesion, and can be employed in the transport of delicate objects, as demonstrated in the pick and place of a silicon wafer. Furthermore, the proposed foam-based FGAs can be readily detached from the adherent surface by applying shear deformation between the pad and the surface. This research clarifies the role of mechanical graded properties in adhesion and can have technical implications {{in the development of a}} simple but effective dry adhesive material for mounting and transporting objects using automated robotic devices. The film terminated dry adhesive pads were further developed to investigate the feasibility of using a foam backing material as a universal platform to improve the adhesive properties of other terminal surface morphologies. Integrating other fast prototyping technologies as an alternative to lithographic templating techniques, scaled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) 3 D printed mushroom capped terminal structures are determined to be comparable to polyacrylate microstructure <b>templated</b> <b>moulds.</b> The effect of the foam is systematically evaluated using a similar axisymmetric indentation/de-bonding test with a probe of a large radius of curvature. Contact splitting through the control of terminal structures in both micro and millimetre scales shows improved contact properties with the addition of foam backing material. The mushroom capped adhesive pads are employed to demonstrate shear peel tolerance and cold temperature surface tolerance demonstrations. Lastly, various sugar and salt templating techniques are explored and optimized for consistency and repeatability to select the material most suitable for current research. Statistical analysis is used in the selection process. A linearly approximated model to determine the pull-off force from foam porosity and stiffness parameters are reported as sample candidates. Model estimates find that the density of sugar granules and the applied preload force are the mostly significant contributors to increasing pull-off force...|$|R
40|$|Water {{jet cutter}} is a {{powerful}} tool in the present engineering scenario which works {{on the principle of}} micro erosion occurring when large volume of water is forced through a nozzle of reduced cross section at high velocity (Mach No: 3) and elevated pressure (3000 bar). Water jet cutter was used to cut lumber by forestry engineer Dr. Norman Franz in 1950 s. [1] Water jet cutting find applications in diverse industries from mining to aerospace, where it is used for cutting, shaping, carving and reaming. Water jet cutting has many advantages like no local heat generation, smaller kerf width hence less material wastage, faster and cheaper, higher accuracy, automation capability, and less burr and rough edge etc. Advanced Composites Division (ACD) is actively engaged in the development of various aircraft parts for on-going National Programmes like TEJAS, SARAS etc. For the development of composite parts the most important aspect is tooling. To develop a tool, one has to start with master model. The technology used in ACD for composite tooling is based on splash technique. To fabricate master models and <b>moulds,</b> we require <b>templates</b> such as base plates, master model check templates, mould-ribs, reference pad fixing location <b>templates</b> and <b>mould</b> check <b>templates</b> etc. These are cut precisely using water jet cutter. In this paper, importance of the water jet cutter for composite tooling, space structure fabrication and ceramic test coupon generation has been highlighted. Abrasive water jet technique is normally used to cut hard materials like titanium, ceramics, Kevlar fibre composites etc., The advantage of using water jet cutter with abrasives is also addressed...|$|R
50|$|Both {{the use of}} {{the giant}} order and this {{decorative}} richness are twin traits peculiar to Palladio’s architectural idiom in the last decade of his life. However, the chromatic contrast between the white of the stone and the red of the brick (even though desired by Palladio in the Convento della Carità in Venice) is only the product of the original surfaces’ degradation: ample remains of the light stucco which once covered the bricks are still quite visible, just below the great Composite capitals.The Palladian loggia replaced an analogous building which had stood on the same site from the Middle Ages, and which had already been reconstructed at least twice during the Cinquecento: a covered public loggia on the ground floor and an audience hall on the upper storey. The new construction became economically viable in April 1571 and works began immediately. Palladio supplied the last drawings for the <b>moulding</b> <b>templates</b> in March 1572 {{and by the end of}} that year the building would have been roofed, since Giannantonio Fasolo could paint the lacunars of the audience hall while Lorenzo Rubini could execute the stuccoes and statues.|$|R

Once placed on mats, the microbial community coats the corpses and forms a three-dimensional sarcophagus composed of microbial cells and exopolymeric substances (EPS). This coverage provides a <b>template</b> for i) <b>moulding</b> superficial features, resulting in negative impressions, and ii) generating replicas. The impressions of fly setulae, fish scales and frog skin verrucae are shaped mainly by small cells in an EPS matrix. Microbes also replicate delicate structures such as the three successive layers that compose a fish eye. The sarcophagus protects the body integrity, allowing the persistence of inner organs such as the ovaries and digestive apparatus in flies, the swim bladder and muscles in fish, and the bone marrow in frog legs. This study brings strong experimental evidence {{to the idea that}} mats favour metazoan fossilization by moulding, replicating and delaying decay. Rapid burial has classically been invoked as a mechanism to explain exceptional preservation.
