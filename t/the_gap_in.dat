5|$|A roadway {{has existed}} since before 1926, {{connecting}} Toppenish and Prosser near the current alignment of SR22, however the roadway was incomplete, with a gap existing between Satus and Mabton. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the roadway {{was completed by}} 1933, and the segment between Toppenish and Prosser was numbered Secondary State Highway 3A (SSH3A) by 1939, while the segment between the current I-82 and US97 was originally numbered as part of Primary State Highway 8 (PSH8). These designations remained until the 1964 state highway renumbering, when SSH3A and the small segment of PSH8 were renumbered SR22. Before the completion of I-82 through the area, SR22 continued into the town of Buena, however now that the interstate has been completed, SR22 has been truncated to the interstate.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the early weeks of January.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{cross-country}} data {{to examine}} the long-term effect of trade openness on <b>the</b> gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> wages, education, political empowerment and health. Key findings are: trade openness since 1970 reduced <b>the</b> gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> wages and educational attainment as of 2011 but did not influence <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> political attainment and health status. The effect of trade openness on <b>the</b> gender wage <b>gap</b> remained observable <b>in</b> later years (1980, 1990 and 2000), although it decreased in degree over time. On the other hand, the effect of trade openness on <b>the</b> gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> educational attainment disappeared in 2000.

30|$|As noted previously, <b>the</b> gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> {{concentration}} of unemployment {{is as important}} as <b>the</b> gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> unemployment rate. Yet few studies have addressed <b>the</b> gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> {{concentration of}} unemployment (Bazen et al. (2013)). One {{purpose of the present study}} is to fill this gap. However, we are interested in not only measuring <b>the</b> gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> concentration of unemployment, but also to explaining this gap. For this purpose, the next two sections of the paper present an econometric analysis of the sources of <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. Their case, however, was declared inadmissible, with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot be challenged. The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's retroactive victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, narrowed <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the Championship from six points to just two.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Hyakutake ordered Shōji {{to abandon}} his {{positions}} at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. Although American forces had almost completely encircled Shōji's troops along Gavaga Creek at Koli, a gap existed {{by way of a}} swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape. The Americans closed <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> their lines on 11 November, but by then Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south.|$|E

One of the earliest sightings by a European-American was in 1806, when Zebulon Pike, mapping the southern boundary of the Louisiana Purchase, spotted <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> what would later be named the Sawatch Range from the upper Arkansas River valley.

5|$|Piłsudski {{arrived at}} the front near Lida on 15 April, {{bringing}} reinforcements from Warsaw. His plan called for exploitation of <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet lines between Vilnius and Lida by an advance towards Vilnius using the road and railway. Amidst diversionary attacks, designed to draw Russian {{attention away from the}} main Polish thrust towards Vilnius, the main Polish attack began at dawn on 16 April. The forces moving on Vilnius included the cavalry group of Colonel Wladyslaw Belina-Prazmowski, composed of 800 men in nine cavalry squadrons and a battery of horse artillery; and infantry under General Edward Rydz-Śmigły, composed of 2,500 men in three battalions of the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division and two batteries of heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed {{a gap in the}} German barbed wire to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> the barbed wire.|$|E

5|$|The British patrol {{aircraft}} prevented Group Trutz {{from attacking}} the Home Fleet. At 21:48 on 17 July, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator assigned to No. 86 Squadron detected and sank U-361; {{none of the}} submarine's crew were rescued. Eight minutes later a No. 210 Squadron Consolidated PBY Catalina piloted by Flying Officer John Cruickshank spotted U-347 on the surface. The submarine's anti-aircraft guns damaged the Catalina, killing the navigator and wounding Cruickshank as well as three other crewmen, but the pilot continued his attack and sank U-347 with depth charges. The Catalina managed to return to base, and Cruickshank was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action.

A further 20U class locomotives were built in 1928 to fill <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> cross-country and semi-fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class. The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be interchangeable with other Maunsell-designed classes.|$|E
