40|$|What is {{the future}} of {{comparative}} economics? This question has been with us since the collapse of the former communist regimes associated with “socialist centrally planned economies”. Various responses have been suggested in the literature during the postcommunist period of economic transformation and I will briefly sketch a few of them below (see section 1). But no one could imagine that a possible dividing line between a quasisocialist system and a deregulated market economy were to persist in some area until today, 2010. Had it been so, would not all those involved into comparative economics have taken this opportunity to prolong the use of their usual economic and institutional tools of comparative analysis in that area? Amazing as it may seem, such an area does exist and my contribution is devoted to briefly present it as an avenue for new comparative economic research. There is a dividing line between the North American closed league system in professional team sports – a sort of island of regulated “quasi-socialist ” economy {{in the middle of a}} liberal American market capitalism – and the European open league system which has rapidly been almost completely deregulated, starting from European football (soccer) in 1995 and spreading throughout other European sports and all open professional team sport leagues. There are four dimensions along which closed and open team sports leagues can be compared: organizational (section 2), in a Walrasian model (section 3), using a Nash-equilibrium conjecture (section 4), and through empirical testing (section 5). I will briefly screen all four. <b>The</b> empirical <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that European open leagues differ from North America...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{spread of}} the English language around the world has made it the primary means of world-wide communication. This implies that most interactions in English occur among non-native speakers in non-native speaking contexts, with English functioning as a “contact language” (Firth 1996), chosen by persons who share neither a mother tongue nor a common culture. One consequence of the global predominance of English {{in the last few}} decades is that today non-native speakers of English far outnumber its native speakers. More precisely, as pointed out by Seidlhofer (2005 : 339) only {{one out of every four}} users of English in the world is a native speaker of the language: Nonetheless, native speakers are still regarded as custodians over what is acceptable usage, with non-native speakers often being regarded as ‘learners’ forever striving to reach native-speaking proficiency and not granted the status of language users in their own right. The aim of the present paper is to provide a characterization of how non-native speakers negotiate their own identity and try to establish themselves as language users rather than as language learners, on occasion of cross-cultural encounters. Taking into account a series of interviews and a panel discussion recorded from BBC World and CNN International, the study will claim that, in international encounters, when English constitutes the main or only means of communication and the primary preoccupation is mutual intelligibility, it is advisable to introduce the notion of ELF (English as a Lingua Franca), rather than refer to the yardstick of ENL (English as a Native Language). <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> collected <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that non-native speakers can engage in conversations that are not only meaningful but also ‘normal’ and ‘ordinary’ (Firth 1996).

40|$|A {{closer look}} at the colonial {{practices}} of the Spaniards in Peru and the increase of political power through the reforms of Francisco de Toledo and how that indirectly influenced social changes within the Indio caste system. Prior to the reforms of Francisco de Toledo, political and economic corruption was already in motion.

Amidst the expanding colonial society, an unexpected social backlash developed amongst the Indios. To a great degree these social changes can be attributed to Francisco de Toledo's reforms, which enlarged the overall number of royal and local officials, who desired to manipulate the system and enrich themselves. Toledo's reforms permitted a larger majority of Spaniards to exploit the Indios ' productivity, increase their revenues and appease the crown. To some degree, both indirectly and direct 1 y, the reforms encouraged the Indios to assimilate, adapt, change or hide in order to escape the obligations of the Indio caste system.

As reviewed recently (1), dendritic ceils and macrophages differ in many important respects, including their structure {{at the light}} and electron microscopic level, endocytic activity, behavior in in vitro systems, life history and phylogeny, and surface antigens and receptors. It is now possible to separate dendritic cells and macrophages from complex parenchymal mixtures, to monitor {{the purity of the}} preparations, and to cultivate each cell type for prolonged periods in a tissue culture environment. With the availability of the above techniques, it has been possible to evaluate the separate roles of dendritic cells and macrophages in the induction of immune responses. We have reported that dendritic cells serve as powerful stimulators of both the allogeneic and syngeneic mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR),I whereas macrophages (Mth) are either weak or inactive (2 - 4).

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} history of Namaqualand and {{specifically}} the Komaggas community. By taking note of the major developments {{that occurred in the}} area, the effects on this community over the last 200 or so years have been established. The focal point follows {{the history of}} land; its usage, dispossession and importance to the survival of Namaqualanders. Using the records of travellers to the region, the views of government officials, local inhabitants as well as numerous analyses of contemporary authors, a detailed understanding of this area has emerged. Among other things, the research has attempted to ascertain whether the current Komaggas community has a claim to a greater portion of land than it currently holds. Overwhelming evidence exists that supports the idea that the Khoi grouping known as the Nama did indeed make use of a large portion of Namaqualand practicing transhumance in order to survive. Centuries of beneficial use led to local systems of understanding whereby certain tribes had predominance in particular areas and assumed a right to these lands through continual usage. Following colonisation, the movement of Europeans away from the original settlement at Cape Town, slowly but steadily began to undermine the original inhabitants of the Cape. While Namaqualand was able to withstand this push longer than other areas by virtue of its location, its inhabitants began to be negatively affected by the 1800 s. The Nama began to lose their most important commodity, cattle, suffered disease, and were pushed off their ancestral lands and denied access to water sources. A lack of understanding and rationalisation of aboriginal practices relating to land usage and various other customs, as well as a growing racially-charged landscape meant that the Nama, like other Khoi groups, while not explicitly relegated to second class citizens by government, were certainly not supported or given equal treatment. As Europeans were able to secure title and tenure to the best lands in the region, the Nama were sidelined. When Namaqualand became profitable because of copper in the 1850 s, the quest for land became even more fervent. The building of an infrastructure over the next decades would facilitate the diamond industry that began in the 1920 s, a defining moment that signalled the end of any autonomy of movement for the people of Komaggas. Apartheid further relegated their position in society and today Komaggas is a poor and underdeveloped place with few prospects. However, given the importance of the land agenda in post- 1994 South Africa and the success of the Richtersvelders in gaining compensation for loss of land, there is hope for Komaggas. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that the Komaggas community certainly made use of lands outside its current boundaries. Examining the doctrine of aboriginal title it will be argued that they certainly have a claim to some form of land redistribution or restitution. This is based on historical evidence as well as the present need to increase agriculture production and to have access to more land for their livestock...|$|E

40|$|There’s {{no need to}} look far for the villains, says long-time Canberra {{resident}} and Canberra Times editor-in-chief Jack Waterford IS THERE anything more certain than that the various inquiries and inquests into Canberra’s town fires will find a catalogue of incompetence, mismanagement, poor planning and slow reactions? That warnings were ignored, danger signals missed, resources misdeployed and some simply {{not up to the}} job? Personally, I’m suspending my judgment, though I am prepared to bet that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> ultimately <b>show</b> that many more people would have died had all of the resources been right {{in the right place at}} just the right time. Hindsight, however, <b>will</b> invariably <b>show</b> that things could have been better managed, that some clues were staring the managers in the face but unaccountably ignored, and that some of them were not quite up to the task. Who could be surprised, given the relatively low priority emergency services takes almost all of the time? The prospect of canonisation, of finding oneself as Alan Stretton, the hero of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy, or of Phil Koperberg in Sydney every other summer, is ever lower than the prospect of one of Australia’s colonels actually leading Australian troops in combat. One might train all one’s life for it but the paradox is that real success is never having to demonstrate your capacity. And the irony is that the more successful one is at doing so, the more likely it is that the risk managers will progressively starve you of resources, on the basis that the probabilities are low. Most of the time there’s not even the adrenalin rush of actually being involved in actual firefighting, or of being saluted, rightly, as one of the real heroes of a bushfire: the frontline people in danger in front of the flames. Bushfire management is staff work, involving tactics, strategy, communications and logistics, and managers who lead from the front, like generals who do so, are often bloody nuisances. As the horror of January 2 ̆ 7 s inferno became clear, there was much obvious anger shown by residents and others at the front. Where had the resources been? Why did it seem to take so long to react? Much of the anger, however, subsided, first, in a wave of empathy for those who had been doing an impossible task, and second, as it was appreciated that all of the resources in the world could not have stopped the monster which had been unleashed. Indeed, by the time the fire was roaring into Duffy, it is likely that a battalion of fire crews would themselves have been enveloped, particularly had they focused on anything other than saving people. Firefighters are trained in avoiding danger, but the risk of casualties when they see themselves as standing between members of the community and the holocaust is very high. Even now, many Canberrans will not abide criticism of the men and women who fought the flames, and, in some cases, beat them back. In time, however, some will find it easier to distinguish between these and those who deployed them for action. Some will focus on the decision-making shortly before the inferno: what happened when the wind began its assault towards Eucumbene Drive? How long did it take people to react? Were the responses and redeployments the most sensible in the circumstances? And others will focus on a longer time frame, whether the long-term total strategy of fuel reduction, the fact of bush at the suburbs’ gate, or the wisdom of pine next to houses, or, at the firefighting strategy in the week up to the disaster, which culminated in wind changes and a fire suddenly getting right away. I pity those who will find themselves in the frame, because it is in the nature of things that one appreciates with hindsight that one might have responded better, and that inquiries end up looking for someone to blame. The fact is that most of the base conditions for the fire were products of what the community and the nation wanted, by way of a city nestled in, rather than standing knob-like out of, the bush. Even the pine forests, long after their economic use-by date, followed not only conscious decisions to make Canberra self- sufficient for timber, but the idea of a buffer zone inhibiting further suburban development. And, if risky from a fire perspective, it was well integrated into the local lifestyle. But more than this calculus at heaven was involved. The loss of 550 houses sounds appalling, and, of course, it is. But the actuary might see it somewhat differently. Over the past 50 years, say, the risk of a Canberra house’s being burnt in a bushfire has been about one in 8000 in any given year. Still too high for my liking, but that represents a considerable long-term profit for the insurance companies, paying out for the first time ever. No doubt we could get better fire-management plans which did not turn our suburbia into concrete pathways, and better bush fuel-reduction schemes which preserve our visual and environmental amenity. Just as people accept some risk on the roads, fire is a part of our landscape which we accept rather than having our landscapes too much altered. It is highly doubtful that the actions of another 200 emergency services managers and operatives, idle for much of the year, could much alter the odds. Maybe the villains are ourselves, not those who coped the best they could, with the knowledge and the resources they had.
