5000|$|The {{police are}} {{authorized}} {{to use force}} to [...] "quell a disturbance of the peace, or to disperse an unlawful assembly, which either refused to disperse or shows a determination not to disperse," [...] however the use of force must be limited as [...] "as much as possible" [...] using [...] "the least deadly weapon which the circumstances permit." [...] Non-lethal measures required before lethal force may be used include water cannons, <b>tear</b> <b>smoke,</b> riot batons, and rubber pellets; shooting live ammunition into crowds is authorized only after firing warning shots into the air.|$|R
40|$|A smoke {{generator}} system {{was developed for}} in-flight vortex flow studies on the F- 18 high alpha research vehicle (HARV). The development process included conceptual design, a survey of existing systems, component testing, detailed design, fabrication, and functional flight testing. Housed in the forebody of the aircraft, the final system consists of multiple pyrotechnic <b>smoke</b> <b>cartridges</b> which can be fired simultaneously or in sequence. The smoke produced is ducted to desired locations on the aircraft surface. The {{smoke generator}} system (SGS) has been used successfully to identify vortex core and core breakdown locations as functions of flight condition. Although developed for a specific vehicle, this concept may be useful for other aerodynamic flight research which requires the visualization of local flows...|$|R

5000|$|The Jew {{is liable}} to panic and 800-900 Jews {{fighting}} to get up a stairway to escape <b>tear</b> <b>smoke</b> could have produced a deplorable business. ... It is a very frightening thing {{to go into the}} hold full of yelling maniacs when outnumbered six or eight to one. Describing the assault, the officer wrote to his superiors: [...] After a very short pause, with a lot of yelling and female screams, every available weapon up to a biscuit and bulks of timber was hurled at the soldiers. They withstood it admirably and very stoically till the Jews assaulted and in the first rush several soldiers were downed with half a dozen Jews on top kicking and tearing ... No other troops could have done it as well and as humanely as these British ones did. He concluded: It should be borne in mind that the guiding factor in most of the actions of the Jews is to gain the sympathy of the world press.|$|R
50|$|On October 25, 2011, Scott Olsen, a 24-year-old former Marine and Iraq War veteran, {{suffered}} a skull fracture {{caused by a}} projectile that some witnesses claimed was a <b>tear</b> gas or <b>smoke</b> canister fired by police.|$|R
50|$|Grenades {{have also}} been made to release <b>smoke,</b> <b>tear</b> gas and other gases, as well as illumination. Stun grenades are often used to disorient people during entry into a room, {{especially}} where hostages or non-combatants may be present.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} existed as well, {{including a}} life-sign tracking device, as well other game items like <b>tear</b> gas grenades, <b>smoke</b> grenades and medkit. A LAW (Lightweight Anti-tank Weapon) could be used, {{as well as}} night vision and thermal vision.|$|R
50|$|Specialized warheads are {{available}} for illumination, <b>smoke,</b> <b>tear</b> gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a fuel-air explosive (thermobaric) warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead capable of penetrating reactive armor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tear</b> gas and <b>smoke</b> {{blanketed}} downtown Sarajevo, {{where police}} opened fire with rubber bullets on several thousand protesters who {{set fire to}} the headquarters of the capital’s cantonal government. Water cannon was also used to disperse protesters who were trying to enter the presidency building.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{theme of}} Free verse, as with Migjeni's prose, is misery and suffering. It is a poetry of acute social {{awareness}} and despair. Previous generations of poets had sung the beauties of the Albanian {{mountains and the}} sacred traditions of the nation, whereas Migjeni now opened {{his eyes to the}} harsh realities of life, to the appalling level of misery, disease and poverty he discovered all around him. He was a poet of despair who saw no way out, who cherished no hope that anything but death could put an end to suffering. [...] "I suffer with the child whose father cannot buy him a toy. I suffer with the young man who burns with unslaked sexual desire. I suffer with the middle-aged man drowning in the apathy of life. I suffer with the old man who trembles at the prospect of death. I suffer with the peasant struggling with the soil. I suffer with the worker crushed by iron. I suffer with the sick suffering from all the diseases of the world... I suffer with man." [...] Typical of the suffering and of the futility of human endeavour for Migjeni is Rezignata ("Resignation"), a poem in the longest cycle of the collection, Kangët e mjerimit ("Songs of poverty"). Here the poet paints a grim portrait of our earthly existence: sombre nights, <b>tears,</b> <b>smoke,</b> thorns and mud. Rarely does {{a breath of fresh air}} or a vision of nature seep through the gloom. When nature does occur in the verse of Migjeni, then of course it is autumn.|$|R
50|$|One protester, Iraq War veteran Scott Olsen, {{suffered}} a skull fracture {{caused by a}} projectile that witnesses believed was a <b>tear</b> gas or <b>smoke</b> canister fired by police. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital by other protesters, who were struck with unknown projectiles while attempting to aid him. At least two other protesters were also injured. The American Civil Liberties Union and National Lawyers Guild called for an investigation into the use of alleged use of excessive force by some Oakland police officers.|$|R
50|$|Rachel Leighton is an {{athletic}} woman with no superhuman powers. She has skill in gymnastics, and at pitching small ballistic objects with great accuracy, and at piloting small aircraft. She also has knowledge of general street-fighting techniques, and some jujitsu. Leighton wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric backed by Kevlar weave, with two biceps-belts and two thigh-belts for carrying throwing diamonds, concealed pockets in the boot tops, boot-heels, glove tops, and brassiere for other throwing diamonds, and throwing diamond earrings. Her personal weaponry consists of throwing diamonds, which are actually 4 in hollow zirconium octahedrons (though not made of diamond, they are shaped like diamonds) containing various substances; spent uranium, plastic explosives, nitric acid, <b>tear</b> gas, <b>smoke,</b> curare-derived narcotics, etc. Her equipment was originally designed and manufactured by the Trapster, but her later design and manufacture {{was by the}} Tinkerer.|$|R
5000|$|Salazar {{was resting}} in the Silver Dollar Bar after protest became violent. According to a witness, [...] "Ruben Salazar had just sat down to sip a quiet beer at the bar, away from the madness in the street, when a deputy fired a tear gas projectile" [...] at a crowd which went into the {{interior}} of the bar, hitting Salazar in the head and killing him instantly. The sheriff's deputy fired a 10-inch wall-piercing type of tear gas round from a tear gas guns of the type intended for barricade situation, rather than the type of tear gas round designed to be fired directly at people (which produces a plume of <b>tear</b> gas <b>smoke).</b> The deputy was found to have mistakenly loaded the wrong type of tear gas round, as the two types of cylinders were nearly identical.|$|R
25|$|Riot {{police on}} 2 October used <b>tear</b> gas and <b>smoke</b> bombs to {{disperse}} hundreds of stateless demonstrators who were demanding citizenship. Witnesses and activists {{said at least}} three people, including a policeman, were slightly wounded and 10 stateless were arrested as security forces laid a siege on Taima suburb in Al Jahra which houses {{tens of thousands of}} stateless. The new protest comes a week after three international human rights groups sent an unprecedented letter to Emir Al-Sabah urging him to end alleged abuse against stateless people.|$|R

40|$|AbstractLight {{extinction}} spectrum (LES) {{is particularly}} preferred in particle sizing {{since it is}} a fast, nonintrusive, and easy-to-realize in situ measurement. The dispersion of particles is often neglected in LES based on particle sizing (LESPS). In this communication, we investigate {{the effect of the}} particle refractive index on the extinction properties of particles. We performed a quantitative analysis for the spectral extinction properties of particles with a known size distribution based on two different refractive indices (i. e., the refractive index at a certain wavelength and the dispersive model of refractive index). Our results show that, for water and glass droplets, the biggest difference of extinction values in the two cases is only 0. 003 in the visible region; it has no significant influence in LESPS and can be neglected. For <b>tear</b> gas <b>smoke</b> particles, 2 -chlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS), the biggest difference is 0. 03 in the visible region, and it has great effect on the accuracy of LESPS. Therefore, taking the dispersion of particles into account, the measurement accuracy of particle size distribution and concentration can be improved...|$|R

5|$|On 16 October, the JNA {{mounted a}} major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became {{bogged down in}} the face of {{determined}} Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using <b>tear</b> gas and <b>smoke</b> bombs to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} {{breaking}} into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January, {{with the objective}} now switching to the location, clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes.
