500|$|Pelé, and {{numerous}} journalists and pundits, would later describe the save {{as the greatest}} {{in the history of}} the game. Banks would later say [...] "They won't remember me for winning the World Cup, it'll be for that save. That's how big a thing it is. People just want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> save." [...] In 2002 the UK public voted the save No. 41 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy", the album's longest track saw, Jonathan Davis [...] "descending {{very real}} tears." [...] Davis {{said that the}} song's concept deals with his childhood, saying [...] "People think 'Daddy' was written because my father abused me, but that's not what the song's about. When I was a kid, I was being abused by someone else. I don't really like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song." [...] Some 14 minutes into [...] "Daddy"—well after the song has ended—a hidden track begins to play. The hidden track depicts an {{argument}} {{between a man and}} his wife over a Dodge Dart carburetor.|$|E

500|$|Afraid that Ivy {{would become}} [...] "unrecognizable" [...] and [...] "boring", Durand stated that [...] " [...] really can't stand when [...] musicians, great songwriters, and after having kids they become so boring, [...] about that all day. [...] need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> in [...] songs", {{concluding}} {{that she needed}} [...] "escape". Durand was determined to create [...] "the best album yet", and set up dates and recording sessions with Chase and Schlesinger to work on what would become All Hours. The album explored new genres for Ivy, including EDM and electronic music, something Chase stated [...] "seem natural and ma sense".|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're trying to get me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: [...] "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album {{where the majority of}} the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Facing forward, Moore {{could not}} see Sanchez miss the handoff, but he recalls that [...] "You could feel it, you knew {{something}} wasn't right." [...] When the fumble occurred, Moore was not aware that his buttocks had caused it; he learned of his role only after the game. When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why do I need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I {{think it was a}} miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened. It was a mental mistake and then he just tried to slide. When he did, he actually ran into Brandon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess about--everything {{happened}} to me--except going west," [...] returned Lane. [...] "But I don't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I'm too {{glad to be}} home." ...|$|E
