You just want those <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to see those things, it's part of updating it." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do the <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> We would never have a [...] force you to be a certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to talk about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prominent lyrics in {{the song}} include, [...] "I heard you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?"; [...] "Heaven is a place on earth with you/ Tell me all the <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do"; and [...] "open up a beer... and play a video game?" [...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But I think with that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd go to work and he'd play his video games– but also it was maybe too regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E
