25|$|When the Subway first opened, single-carriage four axle (twin truck) trains were operated. Late in {{the evening}} on the opening day, after 11pm, one car laden with 60 {{passengers}} was run into by another under the River Clyde. Four people were injured, one being taken to the infirmary. This entailed {{the closure of the}} Subway until 19 January 1897. The 20 original wooden bodied carriages were built by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, of Oldbury, Worcestershire. Many continued in service until 1977 in an upgraded form. A further 10 were delivered by the same manufacturer in 1897. From 1898, second four axle (trailer) carriages without a cable gripper mechanism were added, though they were considerably shorter than the front (gripper) carriage. These additional carriages, eventually numbering 30, were built by Hurst Nelson & Company, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. These carriages were soon expanded to match the length of the front carriages, although carriage 41T has been restored to its original length and cut longitudinally and number 39T is preserved in the Riverside Museum. Carriage 41T was on display at Buchanan Street subway station but was removed with <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> of station modernisations. Enquiries with station staff on 27 September 2017 reveal that the removal was conducted {{in the middle of the}} night at the end of 2015 or the start of 2016. The removal sparked protests. Its location is currently unknown. Most of the gripper carriages were subsequently converted to electric traction in 1935. All carriages were originally built with lattice gates (instead of doors) at the ends; many were converted to air-operated sliding doors in the 1960s, but a few retained the gates until 1977.|$|E

[...] "We are going to screen everyone in a creative or executive capacity", he declared. [...] "The work of Communist sympathizers will not be used."

500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E

2500|$|Plans by the US {{to engage}} in peace talks with the Taliban have {{resulted}} in suspension of bilateral security discussions between the US and Afghanistan on 13 June 2013. [...] "In a special meeting chaired by President Hamid Karzai, the president has decided to suspend talks about a security pact with the U.S. because of their inconsistent statements and actions {{in regard to the}} peace process," [...] spokesman Aimal Faizi told Reuters. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the flare-up with Karzai in phone calls on 19 June 2013, Afghan and U.S. officials said, part of <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>round</b> of crisis diplomacy between Washington and Afghanistan's mercurial leader. Negotiations on the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) began earlier 2013 and, if completed, will define the shape of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan for years to come. The security discussions between the U.S. and Afghanistan would provide for a limited number of military trainers and counterterrorism forces to remain in the country. The talks have been complicated by several disagreements, including over the immunity that U.S. troops would enjoy from Afghan laws. Speaking to reporters days before the suspension, U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the commander of the U.S.-led coalition, said, [...] "The bilateral security agreement is critical to any post-2014 presence. So it needs to be taken seriously on both sides." [...] It was not clear how long Karzai would withdraw from the security talks with the US, meant to finalise arrangements for keeping a small US presence in the country after the last of the NATO troops leave 2014. Karzai has said the negotiations would not resume until the Taliban met directly with representatives of the Afghan government, essentially linking the security negotiations to a faltering peace process and making the United States responsible for persuading the Taliban to talk to the Afghan government.|$|E
