5|$|Based on {{the concept}} of {{liberating}} <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed {{on the site of the}} bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.|$|E

5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival.

Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, {{on the assumption that}} images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E

5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E
5|$|During the Western Han period, conscripted peasants were {{organized}} into work teams consisting of {{over a hundred}} thousand laborers. About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over {{a total of five}} years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC. Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor's ancestors. Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation. Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal, built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), respectively.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{published}} many {{articles in}} Inner Light magazine, {{a number of}} which were collected together and published in books. In 1930, the first such collection was published as Mystical Meditations upon the Collects, in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments. In 1931 a number of her Inner Light articles on Spiritualism appeared as Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. She drew a distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and 'cosmic mediums' such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu. In 1934, she assembled a number of her Inner Light articles on Glastonbury as Avalon of the Heart, while further Inner Light articles were assembled as Practical Occultism in Daily Life, a book aimed at a general reader.|$|E

As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain around him, sprayed milk {{into the air and}} sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira is of particular interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form of social interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (Zanahary), the ancestors, and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition {{is the role of}} ambalavelona, believed to be <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E

Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room. Mulder, now convinced that Michael's spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
5|$|Antankarana culture shares many common {{points with}} that of their Sakalava neighbors. Their rituals are similar and honor {{many of the same}} ancestors, and members of both groups adhere to many of the same fady, making it {{difficult}} at times to distinguish the two groups from one another. Relations between the two are amicable. In a custom unique to the Antankarana, called the tsangatsaine, two trees growing before the house of a noble family are tied together to symbolize the unity of the community. and the merger of past with present and the dead with the living. The Antankarana, like many other coastal groups, practice tromba (spirit possession) as a means to commune with ancestors. The royal ancestral spirits that possess tromba mediums are almost always of Sakalava ancestry. It is widely believed that <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead often inhabit crocodiles, and it is often fady among the Antankarana to kill these animals. The Antankarana also believe in tsiny, a kind of nature spirit.|$|E

5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.|$|E
