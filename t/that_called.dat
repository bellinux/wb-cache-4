5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire.

5|$|Karl Mack {{became the}} new main {{commander}} in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry {{on the eve}} of war <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training; new units were led by commanders who had not been given sufficient tactical training in using their units.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Orkney {{prior to this}} time is largely {{the history of the}} ruling aristocracy. From now on the {{ordinary}} people emerge with greater clarity. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants <b>that</b> <b>called</b> themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.|$|E
5|$|The {{union of}} Russia and Belarus, a {{supranational}} confederation, {{was established in}} a 1996–99 series of treaties <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for monetary union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy. However, {{the future of the}} union has been placed in doubt because of Belarus's repeated delays of monetary union, the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution, and a dispute over the petroleum trade.|$|E

5|$|After {{many years}} of {{evaluating}} {{a wide range of}} alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for looser money, government {{control of the}} railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-political council {{responsible}} for the armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the eve of the war <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies, rather than three battalions of six companies. Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, and one of the best of the time anywhere.|$|E

5|$|As a backbencher, McCay opposed {{amendments}} to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for peacetime conscription. He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved {{an amendment to the}} Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions. The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson's Labor government. The Free Trade Party's George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of Minister for Defence.|$|E
5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan <b>that</b> <b>called</b> {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for a massive downsizing of the fishing industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive. Opposition parties and union leaders were {{highly critical of the}} government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign.|$|E
5|$|In September 1911, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company {{placed an}} order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for four new cargo ships—, , , and Pennsylvanian. The {{contract}} {{cost of the}} ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, with a maximum cost of $640,000 each. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed {{that some of the}} nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Pennsylvanian, including financing costs, was $70.35 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $716,000.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulties}} in raising capital for these expansions and despite MIT's privately endowed status, Walker {{and other members of}} the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $200,000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ($ in 2016 dollars). After intensive negotiations <b>that</b> <b>called</b> upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence <b>that</b> <b>called</b> for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown agents <b>that</b> <b>called</b> them in, who {{say they}} are {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E
