5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E
5|$|Early {{estimates}} on {{rebuilding the}} damaged section of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> were {{that it would}} take three years to complete. However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack. The rebuilt section of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact. An outdoor memorial, commissioned by <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008. Since September 11, American Airlines continues to fly from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport.

40|$|The optical {{excitations}} in {{and higher}} fullerenes, including isomers of C_ 76, C_ 78, and C_ 84, are theoretically investigated. We use a tight binding model with long-range Coulomb interactions, {{treated by the}} Hartree-Fock and configuration-interaction methods. We find that the optical excitations in the energy region smaller than about 4 eV have most of their amplitudes at <b>the</b> <b>pentagons.</b> <b>The</b> oscillator strengths of projected absorption almost accord {{with those of the}} total absorption. When the projection is performed on each pentagon and <b>pentagon</b> dimers, <b>the</b> resultant spectrum in the low energy region is quite {{different from that of the}} total absorption.
