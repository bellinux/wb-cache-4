5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical <b>tonal</b> <b>quality,</b> although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> are subjective, but {{a direct}} {{comparison}} of the Vibratosax's <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> {{to that of a}} brass saxophone could be made by having the same player play both instruments. The most effective comparison would be made if the performer played the same song, using the same dynamics and phrasing in both performances. On November 19, 2011, saxophonist Jim Cheek posted such a comparison {{in the form of a}} YouTube video. In the video, Cheek first performed a song on the Vibratosax A1S alto saxophone, and then performed the same song on the Yanagisawa A901 alto saxophone, a traditional brass saxophone. The video can be viewed here.|$|R
50|$|Playing {{styles are}} closely {{linked with the}} drum's {{construction}} and the <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of each language. There is a clear difference in playing styles between areas with predominantly Fulani and Mande-speaking populations and traditionally non-Mande areas further east.|$|R
25|$|The best {{accordions}} {{are always}} fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have {{a far better}} <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> than even the best automatically-manufactured ones. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, {{such as the ones}} improved by Yutaka Usui, a Japanese-born craftsman.|$|E
25|$|Split E {{mechanism}} – {{a system}} whereby the second G key (positioned below the G key) is closed when the right middle-finger key is depressed, enabling a clearer third octave E; standard on most flutes, but omitted from many intermediate- and professional flutes, {{as it can}} reduce the <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> of the third-octave F (F6).|$|E
25|$|Neal {{started to}} write {{some of his}} {{ensembles}} {{with some of the}} figures that come from that early bebop thing. We were really one of the first bands outside of Dizzy's big band that flavored bebop into the big band — different <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> and rhythms, and the drum feeling started changing, and that I think was really the beginning of it...|$|E
5000|$|These flutes have {{an extra}} closed chamber (for {{improved}} timbre and <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities)</b> that extends past the chin to the left shoulder {{and can be used}} as a rest the way violins are rested on the left shoulder.|$|R
50|$|All {{these complex}} air {{coupling}} interactions, and the resonant {{properties of the}} panels themselves, are a key reason that different guitars have different <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities.</b> The sound is a complex mixture of harmonics that give the guitar its distinctive sound.|$|R
50|$|Flocks of Corellas {{are often}} very noisy {{and can be}} heard from a {{considerable}} distance. The call of the Corella is a wavering falsetto with distinctly eerie or ghostly <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities.</b> They also have various shrieks and quaverings of squeaky conversational tones.|$|R
25|$|Early {{recordings}} {{were made}} entirely acoustically, the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus. Sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was very irregular, giving acoustic recordings an instantly recognizable <b>tonal</b> <b>quality.</b> A singer practically {{had to put}} his or {{her face in the}} recording horn. Lower-pitched orchestral instruments such as cellos and double basses were often doubled (or replaced) by louder instruments, such as tubas. Standard violins in orchestral ensembles were commonly replaced by Stroh violins, which became popular with recording studios.|$|E
25|$|Pasquale Vinaccia (1806–c. 1882), modernized the mandolin, adding features, {{creating}} the Neapolitan mandolin c. 1835. Pasquale remodeled, raised and extended the fingerboard to 17 frets, introduced stronger wire strings made of high-tension steel and substituted a machine {{head for the}} friction tuning pegs, then standard. The new wire strings required that he strengthen the mandolin's body, and he deepened the mandolin's bowl, giving the <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> more resonance. He didn't introduce the bent soundboard, as it was present {{in some of the}} instruments made by the previous generation for bronze strings.|$|E
25|$|As a boy, he {{was said}} to {{resemble}} his maternal grandfather, Bhadraiah Sastry who died {{a year before the}} grandson was born. His body, height, <b>tonal</b> <b>quality,</b> poetic talent, together with a sort of purblindness (sic) where all inherited from the grandfather. Due to his partial blindness, he had trouble walking alone in the nights and was unable to read during nights. He was unable to see the numbers written on the blackboard and unable to catch ball while playing. He used to take help from his friends who used to read aloud the school lessons for him.|$|E
5000|$|In violin culture {{many good}} old master-violins have been {{analyzed}} for their sound qualities (e.g. Stradivari, or Guarneri are favoured by many people; though some consider these instruments as too [...] "outwardly" [...] loud, yet lacking the [...] "inner" [...] <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of say Amati).|$|R
5000|$|... The theremin is {{constructed}} by tuning 3 separate radios {{to create a}} system that acts similar to a stand-alone theremin [...] The circuitry in each individual radio is used to functionally modulate the sound out of the third, producing similar <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of a theremin.|$|R
25|$|His {{art can be}} hard to categorize, as he {{explored}} many different styles and techniques. Kraljević's graphic work displays strong <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> and an excellent sense of light and dark relationships, perfectly suiting a sensitive temperament which could express extreme joy, but soon transform into deepest melancholy.|$|R
500|$|Recording {{began on}} 14 April 1966, {{in the same}} session as [...] "Paperback Writer", and {{concluded}} on 16 April, {{with a series of}} overdubs before mixing on the same day. At that time, The Beatles were enthusiastic about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects. These experiments were showcased in their seventh album, Revolver. Geoff Emerick, who was the engineer for both sessions, described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track [...] "faster than normal." [...] When played back, slightly slower than the usual speed, [...] "the music had a radically different <b>tonal</b> <b>quality.</b> The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon's lead vocal: it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down, making Lennon's voice sound higher when played back.|$|E
500|$|The {{background}} vocals in {{the song}} were compressed using a compressor program called Waves Renaissance Compressor, which was used {{in order to create}} an enhanced polished effect. In an interview with Sound on Sound, mixing engineer Phil Tan, who carried out the audio mixing on [...] "SOS", explained that he compressed the background vocals because [...] "SOS" [...] is a [...] "high energy track", and he wanted the vocals to complement it. Tan also noted that the background vocals were pitch shifted to increase <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> and create an enhanced effect during the chorus. The pitch shifting consisted of making the left vocals flat and the right vocals sharp, with varying degrees of delay, and later mixing them together. When asked about the production of the lead vocals, Tan described the song as [...] "a pounding type of song, and the lyrics are a cry for help, so the vocals need to be 'in your face', almost aggressive," [...] and said that he wanted the vocals to remain constant. As with the background vocals, the lead vocals were compressed using the Waves Renaissance Compressor. Tan continued to note that the lack of reverb included on [...] "SOS" [...] was largely {{due to the fact that}} being an uptempo song, there was not a lot of room left to add anything else. Tan explained the production process of sampling [...] "Tainted Love", as well as the changes which were made: ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 8 Months babies can repeat {{emphasized}} syllables. They imitate {{gestures and}} <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> of adult speech. They also produce variegated babbling. Variegated babbles contain mixes of consonant vowel combinations such as [...] "ka da by ba mi doy doy". Variegated babbling differs from reduplicated babbling {{in terms of}} the variation and complexity of syllables that are produced.|$|E
50|$|Electricity {{arrived on}} the organ scene in {{the first decades of}} the 20th century, but it was slow to have a major impact. Electrically powered reed organs {{appeared}} during the first decades of electricity, but their <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> remained much the same as the older, foot-pumped models.|$|R
50|$|Correa's organ {{music was}} {{inspired}} by the unique <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of Spanish organs, unequal temperament, and such devices as the divided keyboard. Modern-day recording technology, coupled with an increased interest in studying ancient organs and building newer instruments to replicate them, has made these works more readily accessible to both performer and listener.|$|R
5000|$|Buffo, {{literally}} [...] "funny", basses are lyrical {{roles that}} demand from their practitioners a solid coloratura technique, {{a capacity for}} patter singing and ripe <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> {{if they are to}} be brought off to maximum effect. They are usually the blustering antagonist of the hero/heroine or the comic-relief fool in bel canto operas.|$|R
2500|$|A {{particularly}} vivid {{effect is}} obtained when the strings plucked simultaneously are an octave apart. This is normally {{heard by the}} ear not as two pitches but as one: [...] {{the sound of the}} higher string is blended with that of the lower one, and the ear hears the lower pitch, enriched in <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> by the additional strength in the upper harmonics of the note sounded by the higher string.|$|E
2500|$|While many harpsichords {{have one}} string per note, more {{elaborate}} harpsichords can {{have two or}} more strings for each notes. When there are multiple strings for each note, these additional strings are called [...] "choirs" [...] of strings. This provides two advantages: the ability to vary volume and ability to vary <b>tonal</b> <b>quality.</b> Volume is increased when the mechanism of the instrument is {{set up by the}} player (see below) so that the press of a single key plucks more than one string. <b>Tonal</b> <b>quality</b> can be varied in two ways. First, different choirs of strings can be designed to have distinct tonal qualities, usually by having one set of strings plucked closer to the nut, which emphasizes the higher harmonics, and produces a [...] "nasal" [...] sound quality. The mechanism of the instrument, called [...] "stops" [...] (following {{the use of the term}} in pipe organs) permits the player to select one choir or the other. [...] Second, having one key pluck two strings at once changes not just volume but also tonal quality; for instance, when two strings tuned to the same pitch are plucked simultaneously, the note is not just louder but also richer and more complex.|$|E
2500|$|The unusual chord {{progression}} is {{an example}} of the Beatles' use of chords for added harmonic expression, a device that Harrison adopted from Lennon's approach to melody. Musicologist Walter Everett describes the composition as [...] "a tour de force of altered scale degrees". He adds that, such is the ambiguity throughout, [...] "its <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> forms the perfect conspirator with the text's and the rhythm's hesitations and unexpected turns." [...] Pollack also views the composition as musically adventurous; he identifies it as a [...] "curious stylistic hybrid" [...] in the pop/rock genre, comprising blues-inflected motifs within a folk-based framework.|$|E
50|$|Pasero {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as {{having one of the}} finest basso voices of his era, ranking on a par with those of his acclaimed compatriots Fernando Autori, Nazzareno De Angelis and Ezio Pinza. Indeed, the voice of Pasero closely resembled that of Pinza in terms of its range, size and exceedingly vibrant <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities.</b>|$|R
50|$|The muyu {{is mostly}} made of {{mulberry}} (or Chinese Toon) wood. The larger type is primarily used in Buddhist temples, but recently appears in sets, varying in diameters and <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities.</b> The set is mainly used for regular rhythms when used for accompaniment. Playing the {{different parts of}} the muyu could have different volume.|$|R
5000|$|Harsh noise wall {{features}} noises layered {{together to}} form a static sound. Harsh noise wall musician Sam MacKinley, also known as The Rita, considered the genre as [...] "the purification of the Japanese harsh noise scene into a more refined crunch, which crystallizes the <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of distortion in a slow moving minimalistic texture." ...|$|R
2500|$|At a later time, {{ranging from}} {{weeks or months}} later to even years later, the dry, direct, {{unprocessed}} guitar recording {{is fed to a}} bridging device (a Reamp unit or reverse DI box) to [...] "re-record" [...] the guitarist's unprocessed performance through a dedicated guitar amplifier cabinet and/or external effects units. The guitar amplifier is placed in the live room or isolation booth of the recording studio and is set up to produce the desired <b>tonal</b> <b>quality,</b> including distortion character and room reverberation. A microphone is placed near the guitar speaker and a new track is recorded, producing the re-amplified, processed track. The microphone cable is connected to the mixing console or mic preamp using a cable, as usual, without using a bridging device.|$|E
2500|$|Description: The Italian {{version of}} this fach is the spinto, which {{literally}} translated means pushed. However this is not accurate in terms of these singers' vocal production. A lyric dramatic soprano has a lyric instrument that can also create big sounds, cutting through an orchestral or choral climax. This voice is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "young" [...] or [...] "youthful" [...] dramatic soprano although this term doesn't necessarily refer to the singer's age but rather to the <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> of the voice. This fach is more clearly delineated in the German system than in the American system. Depending on the singer, however, this voice type can be versatile, as it lies at neither extreme of the soprano spectrum. Spintos are occasionally able to take on lighter mezzo roles, or, conversely, lyric and even coloratura roles.|$|E
2500|$|The Bösendorfer {{sound is}} usually {{described}} as darker or richer than the purer but less full-bodied sound of other pianos, such as Steinway & Sons or Yamaha. On the Imperial Grand, this characteristic <b>tonal</b> <b>quality</b> in part {{derives from the}} inclusion of nine additional bass notes below bottom A. [...] These extra keys were originally added so that pianists could play Busoni's transcriptions of J.S. Bach's organ works, which required the 32' bass pipes (usually played on the pedal organ). [...] As very little other music makes direct use of the extra strings, they usually contribute to the piano's sonic character not through being played directly but via Sympathetic resonance, when other strings in the piano are struck, contributing additional body to the tone. [...] Moreover, the bass notes of the Bösendorfer, including the extra bass keys, are very powerful, adding volume in demanding literature.|$|E
50|$|Over centuries, many recipes were {{developed}} which involved {{the combination of}} resins, oils, and other ingredients such as certain waxes. These were believed to impart special <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> to musical instruments and thus were sometimes carefully guarded secrets. The interaction of different ingredients is difficult to predict or reproduce, so expert finishers were often prized professionals.|$|R
50|$|Bandmaster Punchard's {{eventual}} {{retirement in}} 1944 {{coincided with the}} gradual return {{of many of the}} band's servicemen from World War II. The rebuilding task passed to Frank Rawbone who greatly enhanced the technical skill and <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of the band. This enabled a tour of Sweden to be undertaken in 1948, the first extensive post war overseas campaign by a Salvation Army band.|$|R
5000|$|The {{record labels}} were a {{distinctive}} pale green with a lettered ribbon surround, and the prefix was SH. The technical quality of these transfers reflected {{a desire to}} preserve the <b>tonal</b> <b>qualities</b> of the originals {{even if it meant}} keeping a certain amount of surface-noise (though at HMV, Len Petts and others were assiduous in finding masters and producing vinyl pressings for dubbing).|$|R
