40|$|There is a {{considerable}} mix of models for house durations {{in the literature on}} Neolithic Europe. This article presents a summary of a formal chronological model for the Neolithic tell of Uivar in western Romania. We provide estimates of house duration and relate houses to other features of the development of this tell, from the later sixth to the mid-fifth millennium calbc. Three wider implications are discussed: that the house must be contextualized case by case; that house duration gives powerful insights into the sociality of community; and that houses, surprisingly often taken rather for granted in Neolithic archaeology, should be fully integrated into the interpretation of Neolithic histories. From what perspective, anthropocentric or relational, that may best be done, is open to question; while it may be helpful to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> in terms of the lives and vitality of houses, the ability of people to create and vary history should not be set aside lightly...|$|E

50|$|Introduction {{of these}} {{concepts}} {{to a child}} {{are said to be}} most useful from the ages 4 onward. When considering existing adolescent trends with regards to cognitive development, it is around the age of 4 that individuals begin to realize that thoughts may not always be true. This is the around the age where the ability to acquire knowledge through induction occurs for the child. Thus, the ability to <b>think</b> sequentially (<b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> being classified as vertical thinking) is a concept that will begin to resonate with the child. Due to the fact that individuals generally affiliate themselves with a single method of thinking, being either vertical or later, Paul Sloane suggests the introduction of such situation puzzles at a young age. This is said to help stimulate the type of thinking the child would otherwise not be comfortable with.|$|R

That's one of the components of the first writing assignment [...] . having them talk about, in that cultural autobiography [...] . How do you see your self-construal?

30|$|Of {{course the}} system is {{preliminary}} and open for extensions, such as studying the model with web sites containing more than one picture on a page. It is significant to note here that we also tested our tool (not reported here) with few real-time websites (while not considering the semantics of pictures), where it worked well and provided useful and usable suggestions to the user. We used here a small website for evaluating the tool and in all cases (all questions) {{the answer to the}} question was found by the model. This triggers the questions what happens when a set of related websites is used, and also when the model fails, in the sense that no solution to the search goal is found, what information should be given to the user. One could <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> of suggesting several alternatives consisting of the best links (more than one). Another possibility is to present two suggestions when information scent values are closely together. Several options are possible and need to be examined empirically. Another issue for further research concerns the situation that the system proposes wrong links that mislead the user. Quite another interesting research area involves the specificity of goals (given to the user or formulated by the user him/herself). Goals (or tasks) can be too general or too specific given the information available in the website(s) [27]. The efficacy of the performance of the model will be dependent on the appropriateness of the goal. This is as it should be: when the model (or user) is asking a too general or too specific question its behavior deteriorates or slows down. The support that can be given is equally dependent on posing the right goal level or asking the right question so to say. We are working this moment on the issue of using real time websites and testing the model in this environment. Here we will also pay attention to the respective contribution of the different features (navigation path, backtracking strategy and picture information). The issues mentioned will be tackled in subsequent research.|$|E

6000|$|One {{case has}} been found of a protectively {{coloured}} larva,--one, moreover, which in all its habits shows that it trusts to concealment to escape its enemies--which was yet always rejected by lizards after they had seized it, evidently {{under the impression that}} from its colour it would be eatable. This is the caterpillar of the very common moth Mania typica; and Mr. Poulton <b>thinks</b> that, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> the unpleasant taste is an incidental result of some physiological processes in the organism, and is itself a merely useless character. It is evident that the insect would not conceal itself so carefully as it does if it had not some enemies, and these are probably birds or small mammals, as its food-plants are said to be dock and willow-herb, not suggestive of places frequented by lizards; and it has been found by experiment that lizards and birds have not always the same likes and dislikes. The case is interesting, because it shows that nauseous fluids sometimes occur sporadically, and may thus be intensified by natural selection when required for the purpose of protection. Another exceptional case is that of the very conspicuous caterpillar of the spurge hawk-moth (Deilephila euphorbiae), which was at once eaten by a lizard, although, as it exposes itself on its food-plant in the daytime and is very abundant in some localities, it must almost certainly be disliked by birds or by some animals who would otherwise devour it. If disturbed while feeding it is said to turn round with fury and eject a quantity of green liquid, of an acid and disagreeable smell {{similar to that of the}} spurge milk, only worse.[97] ...|$|R

There is an engagement, or almost an engagement, announced between my dear Caroline and M. de la Feste--to Caroline's sublime happiness, and my mother's entire satisfaction; as well as to that of the Marlets. They and my mother seem to know all about the young man--which is more than I do, though a little extended information about him, considering that I am Caroline's elder sister, would not have been amiss. I half feel with my father, who is much surprised, and, I am sure, not altogether satisfied, that he should not have been consulted at all before matters reached such a definite stage, though he is too amiable to say so openly. I don't quite say that a good thing should have been hindered for the sake of our opinion, if it is a good thing; but the announcement comes very suddenly. It must have been foreseen by my mother for some time that this upshot was probable, and Caroline might have told me more distinctly that M. de la Feste was her lover, instead of alluding so mysteriously to him as only a friend of the Marlets, and lately dropping his name altogether. My father, without exactly objecting to him as a Frenchman, 'wishes he were of English or some other reasonable nationality for one's son-in-law,' but I tell him that the demarcations of races, kingdoms, and creeds, are wearing down every day, that patriotism is a sort of vice, and that the character of the individual is all we need <b>think</b> about <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> I wonder if, in the event of their marriage, he will continue to live at Versailles, or if he will come to England.|$|R

40|$|In Taxon 10 (1961) 261, a {{proposal}} was published to conserve the generic {{name of the}} Papuan genus Phyllocharis Diels, 1917, against Phyllocharis Fée, Essai Crypt. (1824) lix, xciv, t. ii, fig. 3 & 7, a name for a genus of Lichens. Fée was the only author who ever recognized it; it was reduced by Montagne about 15 years later and this reduction was accepted by all later lichenologists. As {{a matter of fact}} an experienced lichenologist was one of the three botanists who endorsed the proposal by undersigning it. Therefore, no harm would have come from accepting the proposal and this would have been distinctly useful for stabilizing the generic name Phyllocharis in the Campanulaceae, not only for the few botanists working in New Guinea, but for all handbooks and monographs on the family. It is precisely for this purpose that there is the provision in the Rules to conserve generic names. No useful purpose is pursued to drop established names if it is reasonable to maintain them, which I strongly <b>think</b> it is <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> The proposal has unfortunately been found redundant by the majority of the Subcommittee for Phanerogams (Taxon 12, 1963, 238) and was rejected.
