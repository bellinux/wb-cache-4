5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – just <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract {{until the end of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau {{came to the}} Birns and Sawyer film lot, {{rented a}} studio, and bought a [...] "complete Beginning Director package," [...] which {{included}} the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras. Wiseau, confused {{about the differences between}} 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E

If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E

He said in 1986, [...] "I wanted Kirk <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Get lost, Jim,' without obligation if it didn't work." [...] Like {{most of the big}} studios in the 1960s, MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory. Instead, Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the MGM Grand Hotel he was building. [...] "We've been using old-fashioned methods here," [...] Aubrey said at the time. In 1986, he said the company was [...] "total disarray.

500|$|Around 5:00 pm {{the wind}} began to shift, to British disadvantage. De Grasse gave signals for the van to move further ahead {{so that more}} of the French fleet might engage, but Bougainville, fully engaged with the British van at musket range, {{did not want to}} risk [...] "severe {{handling}} had the French presented the stern." [...] When he did finally begin pulling away, British leaders interpreted it as a retreat: [...] "the French van suffered most, because it was obliged to bear away." [...] Rather than follow, the British hung back, continuing to fire at long range; this prompted one French officer to write that the British [...] "only engaged from far off and simply in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they had fought." [...] Sunset brought an end to the firefight, with both fleets continuing on a roughly southeast tack, away from the bay.|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} was announced, U2 guitarist The Edge {{said of the}} show's design: [...] "It's hard {{to come up with}} {{something}} that's fundamentally different, but we have, I think, on this tour. Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill." [...] Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: [...] "We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object." [...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: [...] "The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues. An auction of the stages was planned following the last concert.|$|E

[...] The teens of Ramsay Street warm to her eventually and with their help, Donna changes her ways and becomes accepted. The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration into the street and the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl. You can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week. It's fun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and do these things you normally wouldn't".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E
500|$|With the Queen's Birthday match {{marketed as}} the club's biggest match during the year, then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, {{promoted}} {{the debut of}} Watts by imploring fans to come along so they [...] "will look back {{at this time in}} three, four or five years to see where it all began and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I was there the day Jack Watts made his debut". His first touch saw him gang tackled by three Collingwood players, another contest saw him beaten by Martin Clarke, which led to a Collingwood goal; Collingwood captain, Nick Maxwell, gestured to Watts [...] "that's your goal, mate! Welcome to real footy". The team ultimately lost by sixty-six points with Watts recording just eight disposals, a mark and a behind, playing on the half-forward line. He retained his spot the next week for a forty-eight point loss against [...] at Etihad Stadium in which he kicked his first AFL goal. Recording nine disposals in his second match, the excitement surrounding Watts quickly turned to criticism with his school football coach and former AFL footballer, Robert Shaw, stating that he was not ready for AFL football. Premiership player and coach, Leigh Matthews, said he had not seen anything in Watts' first two matches to warrant him being the number one draft pick. He played his third and final AFL match of the year the next week in the fifty-five point loss against [...] at the Gabba, where The Age journalist, Andrew Stafford, noted his confidence looked low. He spent the remainder of the year playing in the VFL.|$|E

500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the shit that she got to say {{and get away with}} it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct {{on the day of}} nezifah was sufficient apology.
