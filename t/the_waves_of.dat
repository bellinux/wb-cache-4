5|$|First, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> Norse {{colonisation}} {{of northern}} {{parts of the}} British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English {{seems to have been}} in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).|$|E
5|$|Hill censer: The hill censer, {{a vessel}} used for burning incense, {{dates to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BC â€“ 220 AD). The censers are shaped like {{mountains}} and were used for religious rituals. The shape of the hill censer acts as a visual aid for envisioning the sacred mountains that {{were said to have}} been inhabited by Taoist immortals. Hill censers were originally designed for Taoist rituals, but were later used by Chinese Buddhists. Hill censers often include carvings of wilds animals and birds. Some censers depict waves at the foundation of the vessel, said to be <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the East China Sea. A hole {{at the top of the}} censer releases the smoke of the incense.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E

40|$|The {{polarographic}} {{reduction of}} CO 2, COS, and CS 2 {{has been studied}} in several aprotic solvents and in DMF-water mixtures. COS gives one wave in most solvents, presumably by one-electron step, at less negative potential than <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 and at more negative than <b>the</b> first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2, as expected. A week proton-donor, such as water or phenol affects on <b>the</b> second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2, while benzoic acid on even <b>the</b> first <b>wave</b> in DMF. By {{the use of a}} higher alkyl-substituted tetraalkylammonium ion as the supporting electrolyte, <b>the</b> second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2 shifts to more negative potential. Good liniarity is found between the donor number of the solvent and the half-wave potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 and COS, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2...|$|R
