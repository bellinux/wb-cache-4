5000|$|ChicagoFest, {{started by}} mayor Michael Bilandic, was the {{precursor}} to the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago. After Bilandic's tenure in office, newly elected Mayor Jane Byrne attempted to end the festival {{as well as many}} other programs associated with the former mayor. Many Chicagoans disapproved of Mayor Byrne's attempt to stop the festivities (although attendance at ChicagoFest had begun to wane). She and her successor, Mayor Harold Washington, dedicated more time and energy to promoting the Taste, slowly phasing ChicagoFest out in the process. Mayor Washington finally put an end to ChicagoFest when in 1983 it was moved from Navy Pier to Soldier Field and attendance continued to wane. The popularity <b>of</b> the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago has prompted other cities to spawn numerous offshoots and equivalents throughout the United States, such as the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Champaign, CityFest in Detroit, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> the Danforth in Toronto, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Kalamazoo, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Addison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Denver, <b>Taste</b> in Dallas, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Madison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Austin, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Peoria in Peoria, Illinois, and the Bite in Portland to name a few.
