40|$|In this paper, FeCo films (55 ~ 80 at. % Co) were {{electrodeposited}} {{at different}} <b>bath</b> <b>temperatures.</b> With increasing <b>bath</b> <b>temperature,</b> the Co content is increased while Fe content is decreased. Elevated <b>bath</b> <b>temperature</b> promotes {{the formation of}} metastable α-Mn phase (50 ~ 80 oC) while the fcc solid solution forms at low temperature (less than 30 o C). The bcc α-Co 7 Fe 3 phase is favored at intermediated temperature (RT~ 50 o C). However, a mixed phase (bcc + fcc) is formed in FeCo film electrodeposited at 90 o C. XANES results are consistent well with XRD data. In addition, higher <b>bath</b> <b>temperature</b> leads to a small decrease in the lattice parameters of both bcc phase and α-Mn type Co 0. 72 Fe 0. 28 phase. With increasing <b>bath</b> <b>temperature,</b> the averaged grain sizes of fcc phase and bcc phase decrease while that of α-Mn type Co 0. 72 Fe 0. 28 phase increase.

50|$|These {{devices are}} {{also known as}} glass {{capillary}} viscometers or Ostwald viscometers, named after Wilhelm Ostwald. Another version is the Ubbelohde viscometer, which consists of a U-shaped glass tube held vertically in a controlled <b>temperature</b> <b>bath.</b> In one arm of the U is a vertical section of precise narrow bore (the capillary). Above there is a bulb, with it is another bulb lower down on the other arm. In use, liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction, then allowed to flow down through the capillary into the lower bulb. Two marks (one above and one below the upper bulb) indicate a known volume. The time taken for {{the level of the}} liquid to pass between these marks is proportional to the kinematic viscosity. Most commercial units are provided with a conversion factor, or can be calibrated by a fluid of known properties.The time required for the test liquid to flow through a capillary of a known diameter of a certain factor between two marked points is measured. By multiplying the time taken by the factor of the viscometer, the kinematic viscosity is obtained.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interaction of}} a quantum system (spin- 1 / 2) with a macroscopic quantum apparatus (harmonic oscillator) {{which in turn is}} coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators. Exact solutions of the Markovian Master equation show that the reduced density matrix of the system-apparatus combine decoheres to a statistical mixture where up and down spins eventually correlate with pointer states of the apparatus. For the zero <b>temperature</b> <b>bath</b> these pointer states turn out to be coherent states of the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary initial states of the apparatus. For a high <b>temperature</b> <b>bath</b> pointer states are Gaussian distributions (generalized coherent states). For both cases, the off-diagonal elements in spin-space decohere over a time scale which goes inversely as the square of the "separation" between the "pointers".
