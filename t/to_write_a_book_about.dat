25|$|Foucault was in Tunis {{during the}} anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked {{the city in}} June 1967, and which {{continued}} for a year. Although {{highly critical of the}} violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist René Magritte, Foucault started <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> the impressionist artist Eduard Manet, but never completed it.|$|E
25|$|Neville {{returned}} to Australia {{where he met}} his future partner, the journalist Julie Clarke.

He moved to New York City in 1977 to join Clarke, and wrote for The New York Times, New York magazine, and The Village Voice. Due to his experience on the hippie trail, publishers Random House commissioned Neville <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> a serial killer who preyed upon Western backpackers, incarcerated in New Delhi, India.

25|$|In 1912, aged 39, Ranjitsinhji {{returned}} to England and played once more. Although announcing himself available {{to play for}} England in that season's Test matches, he was not selected. Restricted for a period by a wrist injury, he nevertheless scored four centuries, including one against the touring Australian team. At times, his form briefly touched that of his best years but most of his cricket was played in the South of England. He scored 1,113 runs at 42.81, placing him eighth in the averages. Ranjitsinhji's last first-class cricket came in 1920; having lost an eye in a hunting accident, he played only three matches and found he could not focus on the ball properly. Possibly prompted by embarrassment at his performance, he later claimed his sole motivation for returning was <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> batting with one eye; such a book was never published.|$|E
