5|$|In 1939, {{following}} the 1938 Munich Agreement and Hitler's subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia, Stalin believed that Britain and France {{would not be}} reliable allies against German expansion so instead sought to conciliate Nazi Germany.

5|$|Among Combs' other accomplishments as {{governor}} were requiring voting machines in state elections and {{passage of a}} law making the assessment of state employees for political campaign funds a felony. At {{the end of his}} term, Combs backed Edward T. Breathitt <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> {{as governor}}. Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican Louie B. Nunn in the general election. It was the only time in the 20th century that a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong had {{recovered}} from severe heart {{problems in the}} late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> {{in the event of}} his death.

Father might have lived another five-and-twenty years, and God knows I have never looked forward <b>to</b> <b>succeeding</b> <b>him.</b> Sit down {{and let me tell}} you the story. It was not my father's fault that he reigned here so long as master, it was the result of a whim of your father's. And {{although}} my father fought against it, he could not resist the dying prayer of my uncle." ...|$|R

Smythe resigned the chairmanship after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962 and Bassett succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} {{success for the}} Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him,</b> opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was {{reconciled}} with Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> at Canterbury. Wilfrid {{may have been involved}} in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.|$|E

50|$|Though {{his father}} had legitimated him and his three {{surviving}} siblings, and even declared his two sons by Madame de Montespan fit <b>to</b> eventually <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the throne of France, this was not to be, as immediately after Louis XIV's death the Parlement of Paris reversed the king's will.|$|R
5|$|Gabriel Ramanantsoa, a {{major general}} in the army, was {{appointed}} interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, appointed <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him,</b> was assassinated six days into his tenure. General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, who ushered in the socialist-Marxist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.|$|E
5|$|His {{dispute with}} the General Assembly over the naming of a land {{registrar}} left Garrard embittered, and he retired from politics at the expiration of his second term.

Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.|$|E

After five months as Leader, Mair resigned in March 1946 and Treatt was then elected <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> as party leader and hence, Leader of the Opposition.|$|E
50|$|The Dalyell Baronetcy in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia {{was created}} 7 November 1685 for a Scottish General, Thomas Dalyell of the Binns.

Although other leading Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them, King John I overcame their rebellion in some weeks.|$|E
5|$|Morton soon rose {{through the}} party ranks, {{becoming}} touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him,</b> and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E

50|$|Museveni moved Muhoozi to {{the post}} of Senior Presidential Adviser for Special Operations on 10 January 2017.

5|$|Peace was {{restored}} with {{the mediation of}} Henry I of Jerusalem, who persuaded both Leo and Bohemond to renounce their claims to suzerainty over each other.

Raymond died in early 1197, but his widow {{give birth to a}} posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen.

5|$|When University of Kentucky head {{football}} coach Bear Bryant left for Texas A University after the 1953 season, Collier accepted an offer <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him.</b> He stayed at Kentucky for eight years, a span during which the Wildcats football team had a 41–36–3 record, including a 5–2–1 record against arch-rival Tennessee. Notable wins included a 1954 victory at Georgia Tech, then ranked 15th in the AP Poll, and defeats of eighth-ranked Ole Miss in 1955 and 12th-ranked Tennessee in 1957.

5|$|When White {{retired as}} Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>him,</b> {{as he had}} {{as chief of staff}} of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from more senior officers, particularly Major General Victor Sellheim, at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the new post of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, Bishop Dennis Marion Schnurr of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Duluth, Minnesota, {{was named}} by Pope Benedict XVI as Archbishop Pilarczyk's coadjutor archbishop.

50|$|Urraca became again an heir {{presumptive}} {{after the death}} of her half-brother Sancho at the Battle of Uclés in 1108. Alfonso VI reunited the nobles of the Kingdom in Toledo and announced that his widowed daughter was the chosen one <b>to</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>him.</b> The nobles agreed with the royal designation but demanded that Urraca should marry again. Several candidates for the hand of the heiress to the thrones of León and Castile appeared immediately, including counts Gómez González and Pedro González de Lara. Alfonso VI feared that the rivalries between Castilian and Leonese nobles would be increased if she married any of these suitors and decided that his daughter should wed Alfonso I of Aragon, known as the Battler, opening the opportunity for uniting León-Castile with Aragon.|$|R
