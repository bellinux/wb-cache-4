5|$|Nevinson {{studied at}} the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and {{alongside}} Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, {{the leader of the}} Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.|$|E

50|$|Futurism was {{an early}} twentieth-century {{movement}} in Italy that sought to free the country from what <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> saw as <b>the</b> dead weight of its classical past. <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> were preoccupied with the technology and dynamism of modern life. The movement found its expression primarily in literature and art.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> {{expressed}} a loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. They admired speed, technology, youth and violence, the car, the airplane {{and the industrial}} city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature, and they were passionate nationalists. <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> practised in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture and even gastronomy.|$|R

25|$|Theater {{also has}} an {{important}} place within <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Gino Severini was {{despatched}} from Milan to Florence to {{make peace}} with Soffici on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> - <b>the</b> Peace of Florence, as Boccioni called it. After these diplomatic overtures, Soffici, together with Giovanni Papini, Aldo Palazzeschi and Italo Tavolato withdrew from La Voce in 1913 to form a new periodical, Lacerba, which would concentrate entirely on art and culture. Soffici published [...] "Theory of the movement of plastic Futurism" [...] in Lacerba, accepting that Futurism had reconciled what had previously seemed irreconcilable, Impressionism and Cubism. By its fifth issue Lacerba wholly supported <b>the</b> <b>Futurists.</b> Soffici's paintings in 1913 - e.g. Linee di una strada and Sintesi di una pesaggio autumnale - showed the influence of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> in method and title and he exhibited with them.|$|R
2500|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> {{were not}} truly abolishing syntax. White {{points out that}} since [...] "The OED defines 'syntax' as 'the {{arrangement}} of words in their proper forms) by which their connection and relation in a sentence are shown". <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> were not destroying syntax in that sense. Marinetti in truth advocated a number of [...] "substantial, but nevertheless selective modifications to existing syntax" [...] and that the [...] "Russian Futurists' idea that they were 'shaking syntax loose'" [...] is more accurate.|$|R
5000|$|Boccioni's preparatory {{drawings}} {{for the painting}} (two shown below) depict a head-down racing cyclist, behind in the air, his movement indicated by <b>the</b> characteristic <b>Futurist</b> [...] "force lines" [...] and echoing curves. Force lines, which <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> claimed to have invented, show how an object would resolve itself if it followed the tendencies of its own forces and reflected the interest of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> in <b>the</b> philosophy of Henri Bergson, who believed that material objects exist {{in a state of}} continual flux. The painting is therefore an attempt to represent the dynamic sensation of a cyclist moving through time and space rather than a snap-shot of a particular moment in time. The bicycle, figure, and the surrounding space seemingly fuse together in a single form. [...] Although the bicycle had been invented in the early nineteenth century, it did not come into widespread use until the 1890s. Even in 1913, the bicycle, and the high speeds obtainable on it, still represented for <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> one of <b>the</b> modern forms of transport that they idealised.|$|R
25|$|Saarinen's {{original}} design featured a prominent wing-shaped thin shell roof over the headhouse (or main terminal); unusual tube-shaped red-carpeted departure-arrival corridors; and tall windows enabling expansive views of departing and arriving jets. The design straddles <b>the</b> <b>Futurist,</b> Neo-futurist, Googie and Fantastic architectural styles.|$|E
25|$|A {{revival of}} sorts of <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> {{movement}} in theatre began in 1988 {{with the creation}} of the Neo-Futurist style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Montreal.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Futurist</b> method {{approaches}} Revelation as chiefly {{referring to}} events which as yet {{have not come}} to pass, but which {{will take place at}} the end of this age and at the end of the world. The main focus is the return of Christ. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies.|$|E
2500|$|Futurism as a {{literary}} movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909), as it delineated <b>the</b> various ideals <b>Futurist</b> poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not {{to be confused with}} the actual length of the poem). [...] <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> called their style of poetry parole in libertà (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.|$|R
25|$|Publishing manifestos was {{a feature}} of Futurism, and <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> (usually led or {{prompted}} by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.|$|R
5000|$|According to the band's {{official}} website, Of Natural History {{is in part}} [...] "a {{debate between}} two contradictory pillars of 20th C. Anti-Humanism: <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> versus <b>the</b> Unabomber." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{first and}} most famous Constructivist {{architectural}} project was the 1919 proposal for {{the headquarters of the}} Comintern in St Petersburg by <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> Vladimir Tatlin, often called Tatlin's Tower. Though it remained unbuilt, the materials—glass and steel—and its futuristic ethos and political slant (the movements of its internal volumes were meant to symbolise revolution and the dialectic) {{set the tone for the}} projects of the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{advocated}} Timothy Leary's 8-Circuit Model of Consciousness and neurosomatic/linguistic engineering, {{which he}} wrote about in many books including Prometheus Rising (1983, revised 1997) and Quantum Psychology (1990), which contain practical techniques intended to help the reader break free of one's reality tunnels. With Leary, he helped promote <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> ideas of space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension, which they combined to form the word symbol SMI²LE.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} better provide stark, contrasting, analogies, <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> {{literature}} promoted a kind of hyper-conciseness. It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism. The former refers to a paring down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere. This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and why there are no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed).|$|E
50|$|Conti {{was born}} in Florence. Between the ages of 8 and 9, he showed {{precocious}} talent {{in the fields of}} music, poetry and painting. In 1913 he met <b>the</b> <b>Futurists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1978 he iventoried {{the postal}} {{innovations}} of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists,</b> thus establishing a new historiographic object: [...] "Futuristic Postal Art", proclaiming {{the invention of}} Mail Art by the avant-gardists of the 1920s.|$|R
2500|$|Traditional theatre often {{served as}} a target for Futurists because of its deep roots in {{classical}} societies. In its stead, <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> exalted <b>the</b> variety theatre, vaudeville, and music hall because, they argued, it [...] "had no tradition; it was a recent discovery". Vaudevillian acts aligned themselves well to the notions of [...] "stupefaction" [...] as there was the desire to surprise and excite the audience. Furthermore, the heavy use of machinery attracted <b>the</b> <b>Futurists,</b> as well as Vaudevillian acts' tendency to [...] "destroy" [...] the masterpieces of the past through parody {{and other forms of}} depreciation.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Futurist</b> art {{movement}} {{was important for}} the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the Dada art movement (a prime example being the Antisymphony concert performed on April 30, 1919 in Berlin), and later the Surrealist and Fluxus art movements, specifically the Fluxus artists Joe Jones, Yasunao Tone, George Brecht, Robert Watts, Wolf Vostell, Dieter Roth, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Walter De Maria's Ocean Music, Milan Knížák's Broken Music Composition, early LaMonte Young and Takehisa Kosugi.|$|E
25|$|Russian Futurism was a {{movement}} of literature and the visual arts. The poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as David Burlyuk, Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova and Kazimir Malevich found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included Velimir Khlebnikov and Aleksey Kruchenykh. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> opera Victory Over the Sun, with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Futurist</b> and constructivist {{architectural}} movements, and the dada anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism {{and often}} contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, Frülicht included constructivist projects, including Vladimir Tatlins Monument to the Third International. However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination, and urbanism tendencies {{which were not}} to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist Antonio Sant'Elia. The Merzbau by Dada artist Kurt Schwitters, with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the work was the discrediting of the great works of theatre. These new theatrical ideal of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> helped to establish a new genre of theatre: the synthetic play.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} work, {{the lines of}} the preparatory {{drawings}} are translated into curves and cones, outlined using Boccioni's characteristic divisionist technique. This technique was primarily derived from <b>the</b> early <b>Futurist</b> Giacomo Balla. Boccioni, after visiting Parisian avant-garde painters, added new elements to the style, including the typical Cubist segmentation of planes.The discordant colour choices reflect the failure of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> to develop a coherent colour theory to match their theories in other areas.|$|R
50|$|Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova {{developed}} rayonism {{after hearing}} {{a series of}} lectures about Futurism by Marinetti in Moscow. <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> took speed, technology and modernity as their inspiration, depicting the dynamic character of early 20th century life.|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} {{believed}} that the descending nude came {{too close to the}} influences of Italian Futurism. Although the Section d'Or Cubists tolerated and even enjoyed the presence of foreign artists (e.g., Constantin Brâncuși, František Kupka, Alexander Archipenko, Amedeo Modigliani and Joseph Csaky), the French Cubists kept the door firmly closed to the influence of foreign trends. During the month of February 1912, a large Futurist exhibition was held in Paris at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune. Duchamp later denied <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> influence, claiming that the distance between Paris and Italy was too large for any tenable influences to occur.|$|E
25|$|After {{this brief}} synthesis, Neo-Classical {{reaction}} was totally dominant until 1955. Rationalist buildings were still common in industrial architecture, but extinct in urban projects. Last isolated constructivist buildings were launched in 1933–1935, such as Panteleimon Golosov's Pravda building (finished 1935), the Moscow Textile Institute (finished 1938) or Ladovsky's rationalist vestibules for the Moscow Metro. Clearly Modernist competition entries {{were made by}} the Vesnin brothers and Ivan Leonidov for the Narkomtiazhprom project in Red Square, 1934, another unbuilt Stalinist edifice. Traces of Constructivism can also be found in some Socialist Realist works, for instance in <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> elevations of Iofan's ultra-Stalinist 1937 Paris Pavilion, which had Suprematist interiors by Nikolai Suetin.|$|E
25|$|She did {{not want}} to switch to <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> style popular in the art of the early Soviet period, nor paint portraits of commissars, but she found some work at the Kharkov Archaeological Museum, where she made pencil {{drawings}} of the exhibits. In December 1920 she moved to her grandfather’s apartment in Petrograd. After the October Revolution, inhabitants of private apartments were forced to share them with additional inhabitants, but Serebriakova was lucky - she was quartered with artists from the Moscow Art Theatre. Thus, Serebriakova's work during this period focuses on theatre life. Also around this time, Serebriakova's daughter, Tatiana, entered the academy of ballet, and Serebriakova created a series of pastels on the Mariinsky Theater.|$|E
