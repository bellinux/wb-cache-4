5|$|In December, the {{regiment}} saw its first combat of their second enlistment during the Goldsboro Expedition. The {{objective of this}} maneuver was to disrupt the Confederate supply line along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad by destroying the Goldsboro Bridge. Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> expedition, the unit marched 180 miles and {{took part in the}} Battles of Kinston, White Hall and Goldsboro Bridge. During the latter engagement on December 15, 1864, the Goldsboro Bridge was destroyed by Union troops. On December 17, the expedition began its return march to New Bern while the 5th Massachusetts was posted to act as rear guard. In meeting these orders, they withstood heavy fire for two hours and repulsed one infantry charge. At the close of the expedition, {{the regiment}} had suffered light casualties of eight wounded.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) {{attack on}} Nazareth was made {{possible}} by the British Empire infantry attack on 19 September which began the Battle of Sharon. The EEF infantry attacked along an almost continuous front from the Mediterranean Sea, across the Plain of Sharon and into the Judean Hills. The XXI Corps's British Indian Army infantry captured Tulkarm and the headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army. During <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> attack, the infantry created a gap in the Ottoman front line defences through which the Desert Mounted Corps rode northwards to begin the cavalry phase of the battle. Subsequently, the infantry also captured Tabsor, Et Tire and Arara to outflank the Eighth Army. Meanwhile, the Desert Mounted Corps advanced to capture the communications hubs of Afulah, Beisan and Jenin on 20 September, cutting the main Ottoman withdrawal routes along their lines of supply and communications.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians had a {{possible}} and willing {{ally in the}} person of Junayd, ruler of the Aydinid principality in central western Anatolia. Junayd was a capable and energetic ruler who tried to form a broader anti-Ottoman alliance including the Karamanids of central Anatolia, and to renew the Ottoman civil war by sending another Ottoman prince, Ismail, to Rumelia. In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conflict, Murad allied himself with Venice's rival, the Republic of Genoa, to blockade the coasts of Junayd's domain and prevent Ismail from setting sail. Junayd was finally subdued in spring 1425, depriving Venice of any assistance. In February 1424, Murad also concluded a peace with the Byzantines, who returned almost all the lands they had gained in 1403 and, reduced to Constantinople and its environs, became tributary vassals to the Ottomans once more.|$|E

5|$|On 17 September, the {{commander}} of the 104th Brigade, Colonel Ivan Rukljić, took command of all Croatian forces in Varaždin. The Yugoslav Air Force attacked an airfield in Čakovec, mimicking the strike carried out in Varaždin a few days earlier. That evening, the heaviest fighting of the siege erupted in Varaždin, and the 104th Brigade reported it was uncertain how long it would be able to maintain the blockades. Croatian forces received additional weapons that day, after the JNA garrisons in Čakovec, Križevci and Virovitica surrendered to the ZNG. In Varaždin itself, corps-level units of the JNA 32nd Corps based at the 15. maj barracks also surrendered to the ZNG that day. The following day, fighting intensified again, as Croatian forces captured several minor JNA facilities in Varaždin itself—leaving the Corps headquarters, the Kalnički partizani barracks and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks as the only JNA-held military bases in the city. In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fighting, the ZNG suffered one fatality and captured nine JNA officers and 30 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tour, My Chemical Romance dubbed {{themselves}} The Black Parade for {{the first}} part of their performance, convincing many concert goers that The Black Parade was initially a separate, opening band. During the tour there were several cancellations and some members left the tour for personal or medical reasons. Leading up to their tour date at The DCU Arena, many of the staff members of the tour fell ill with food poisoning. The band Circa Survive had to replace Muse, members of which also suffered from the same food poisoning. On January 11, 2007 Frank Iero left the tour because of an unspecified illness. He was replaced by Drive By guitarist Todd Price. Mikey Way took time off to get married and spend time with his new wife (Alicia Simmons) and was replaced by guitar tech, Matt Cortez, from April 18, 2007 until October 4, 2007. Six shows were cancelled from April 29, 2007 to May 4, 2007 after the band and crew contracted food poisoning. Bob Bryar suffered injuries relating to his wrists during the tour which led to the cancellation of the show at the University of Maine on October 27, 2007. Bryar left the tour on November 9, 2007 and was replaced by a friend of the band, Wagner, who wished to remain anonymous. Following the November 11, 2007 show in Newcastle, Frank Iero left the tour to return home after learning about a family member's illness. He was replaced by Matt Cortez.|$|E
5|$|The Altes Stadthaus is {{arranged}} around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces Mühlheimer Platz, has a mansard roof and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance {{is at the}} southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstraße, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of Mülheimer Platz and Münsterstraße, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus—the new city administration building—was built, the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing Mühlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns.
