5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives in <b>the</b> <b>nick</b> <b>of</b> time and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E

40|$|The DNA untwisting enzyme relaxes covalently closed circylar DNAs by <b>the</b> {{sequential}} breaking (<b>nicking)</b> and closure <b>of</b> one {{strand of}} the duplex.
