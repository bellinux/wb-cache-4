The {{shipping}} company had {{signed an agreement}} with the oil companies Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This {{was the first time the}} incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. The initial agreement secured Braathens Helikopter a revenue of NOK800 million in the course of five years, and gave the company a 20% market share. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK60 million. <b>Total</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> were NOK300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. The initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E

About 90% of these investments were financed by grants and 10% by loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. US$100 million were invested in the water sector and 40 million in the wastewater sector.|$|E

Privately financed, the <b>total</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> at 1985 prices were £2.6billion. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4.65billion: an 80% cost overrun.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal design procedure for internally insulated, carbon steel, molten salt thermal storage tanks for parabolic trough solar power plants.

The thermal, mechanical and economic aspects have been integrated into an iterative step-by-step optimization procedure, which is shown to be effective through application to the case study of a 600 MW h thermal storage system.
