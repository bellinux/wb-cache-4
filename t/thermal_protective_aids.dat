40|$|Inflatable {{liferafts}} {{are used}} worldwide {{as a means}} of evacuation and survival from almost all ocean‐going vessels, regardless of their size, purpose or region of operation. Vessel size ranges from fishing and other commercial vessels with small crews to offshore oil installations and passenger ships with thousands of persons onboard. While International Maritime Organisation (IMO) standards currently require inflatable liferaft components to “provide insulation” or “be sufficiently insulated”, no performance criteria accompany these requirements. This paper will outline the methodology and results from a three year research project involving a multidisciplinary team which utilised human subjects and a thermally instrumented manikin to investigate the gaps in knowledge for the thermal performance of inflatable liferafts in cold environments. Tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment with a 16 person SOLAS‐approved liferaft and air and water temperatures as cold as 5 °C. The main variables investigated were clothing wetness (wet and dry) and liferaft floor insulation (insulated and uninsulated). The project’s four main objectives were to: 1) develop thermal protection criteria for inflatable liferafts assuming otherwise unprotected occupants, 2) propose an objective methodology for testing inflatable liferaft thermal protection performance, 3) develop tools for search and rescue planners to predict survival times of liferaft occupants and 4) provide guidance to training authorities and manufacturers. The study found that: 1) the thermal insulation of a combined system of clothing and liferaft using a thermal manikin gave good agreement with measurements using humans, as long as proper corrections for differences between manikin and humans are appropriately applied, 2) system insulation values coupled with a cold exposure survival model can be expected to give search and rescue planners reasonable predictions of survival time in liferafts where hypothermia is the main risk factor and 3) the factors substantially affecting the survival time of liferaft occupants are: whether any type of <b>thermal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>aid</b> (TPA) is worn,clothing wetness, liferaft floor insulation and liferaft ventilation rate...|$|R

40|$|Active Particles at the Temelin NPP, Radiobiological Risks and Protective Precautions The term active {{particle}} (AC) {{was applied}} on Temelín NPP (ETE) {{in order to}} denominate small fragments of high radioactive matters, sized up to 1 millimeter, forming into primary circuit. In accordance with latest available know-how, the ACs major contains corrosion products, that were activated during passing through reactor core. After primary circuit opening, due to carry out outage works, the ACs will spread into ETE radiation controlled area. In proportion to their size, the ACs activity is relative high, so that the ACs can jeopard workers, who will contact them. This jeopardy is namely associated with AC penetration into organism - ingestion or inhalation.

[2010]) {{evaluated}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>protective</b> performance of fabric systems under low level thermal hazards {{in the range}} of 6.3 – 8.3  kW/m 2 by laboratory simulation study following ASTM F 1939 (radiant heat resistance test) and a modified method to capture the contribution of energy stored in the test specimens to skin burn injury. The test was performed on both dry and wet specimens. A water cooled heat flux sensor was used to calibrate the radiant heat source and to measure the energy directly transmitted through the clothing during the exposure and discharged later from the fabric systems. The study established that a typical three layer <b>thermal</b> <b>protective</b> clothing system is required to protect the wearer from skin burn injury even at a low level of radiant thermal exposure. During exposure to heat, the accumulated thermal energy in the fabric system could naturally discharge after the exposure and cause skin burn. This in turn lowers the protection level of the clothing to 0.5 to 3  min from 1 to 5  min calculated from the test results.

Melt-infiltration (M), solvent-dissolving (D) and combined melt-dissolving (MD) for particle dispersion were investigated. Differential Scanning Calorimetric thermograph indicated that microparticle M has maximum heat capacity of 198 J/g whereas the heat capacity of microparticles D and MD {{was found to}} be 139 J/g and 144 J/g, respectively. FT-IR and SEM analyses of the microparticles revealed that the eicosane infiltrated and coated the fine aerogel particles but the microparticles still remained in the powder form. The nanoporous aerogel structure held the infiltrated eicosane while the ultra-high specific surface area of silica aerogel kept the surrounding eicosane in situ by surface tension. Infrared thermal imaging showed that the eicosane did not drip out from the microparticles even at 120 °C, whereas the pure PCM completely changed phase to fluid when heated. The developed microparticles provide ease of coating application in room temperature for <b>thermal</b> <b>protective</b> textiles.

40|$|The {{addition}} of silica aerogel felt (SAF) to firefighters’ protective clothing (FPC) is an innovation {{with the potential}} to enhance the thermal insulation capacity of FPC. In order to explore this technology, this paper describes the results of an experiment that determined the <b>thermal</b> <b>protective</b> performance of FPC with SAF under wood crib fire conditions. We also performed an experiment using FPC materials without SAF and compared the results. Finally, we compared the thermal decomposition of commercial thermal liner material and silica aerogel. The results demonstrate that the temperature at the surface of the comfort layer of the SAF-containing sample was lower than that of the commercial sample. This experiment confirms that lower overall temperatures are found {{on the surface of the}} comfort layer of the specimen with SAF than on the specimen without SAF, even when the thicknesses of the thermal liner layers are similar. The maximum temperature difference was about 20 °C. The <b>thermal</b> <b>protective</b> performance of FPC with SAF increased with increasing SAF thickness, but the increase became very minor when the SAF thickness exceeded 6 mm. Additionally, the thermal stability of silica aerogel is significantly better than that of commercial thermal liner material, reducing the risk of thermal decomposition at high temperatures.
