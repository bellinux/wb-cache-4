5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E

Hence, in this paper, the authours intend to clarify unsolved problems in <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and determine <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measuring <b>separation.</b> Results obtained are summarized as follows; 1) <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> occurred in TMCP steel plate is changed by impact energy. <b>The</b> maximum <b>separation</b> index should {{be obtained by}} the Charpy test with impact energy of 30 kgf･m. 2) <b>The</b> <b>separation</b> consists <b>of</b> types a, b and c, but type c can be disregarded in <b>the</b> evalution <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> 3) It needs to measure <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> over 1 mm. 4) In the COD test, momentary slight drop of load by <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> can be disregarded, and <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> can be evaluated by the reduction of specimen width...|$|R
