25|$|The year 2000 {{began with}} Jones easily beating the hard-punching David Telesco via a 12-round {{decision}} on January 15, at Radio City Music Hall to retain his titles. Jones reportedly fractured his wrist {{a few weeks}} before this fight and fought almost exclusively one-handed. He entered the ring surrounded by the famous group of dancers, The Rockettes. His next fight was also a first time boxing event for a venue, as he traveled to Indianapolis and retained his title with an 11-round technical knockout over Richard Hall at the Conseco Fieldhouse. A post fight drug test showed that both Jones and Hall tested positive for androstenedione which was available legally over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> that time but banned by the IBF. The results of Jones' next two drug tests, which were negative, were sent to the Indiana Boxing Commission. The IBF chose not to take any action against Jones or Hall. Jones ended the year with a 10-round stoppage of undefeated Eric Harding in New Orleans.|$|E

500|$|An intense {{performer}} on {{the playing}} field, Youkilis {{was known for his}} scrappiness, grittiness, dirt-stained jerseys, home-plate collisions, and his strange batting stance. He excelled despite a physique that led many observers to underestimate his athletic ability. He was called [...] "roly-poly" [...] by his high school coach, [...] "pudgy" [...] by his college coach, a [...] "fat kid" [...] by general manager Billy Beane, and a [...] "thicker-bodied guy" [...] by the Red Sox scout who recruited him. As Jackie MacMullan wrote for the Boston Globe: [...] "He does not look like an MVP candidate; more a refrigerator repairman, a butcher, the man selling hammers behind <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> the True Value hardware store." [...] Youkilis was named to the Sporting News list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 36 on the list in 2009, No. 38 in 2010, and No. 35 in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Don Perry guest starred as an {{airplane}} passenger next to Jerry, when {{he wakes up}} from his nightmare. Perry states {{that he might be}} the last person Jerry will see alive. This line was not in the original script, but was added because Perry, as Charles explained, [...] "just had the right look". Christine Dunford was cast as Leslie, Charles commented [...] "she just came in; gave a great reading. At this point in our show business history, I don't think we knew anybody". Dunford would return later as a saleswoman in the season five episode [...] "The Pie". Margaret Reed, best known for her role on the soap opera As the World Turns, appeared as Mary Cantardi, a woman who screams at Jerry for not calling her back after a date. Vic Polizos and James Lashly guest-starred as the Russian cable installers. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra in the first scene of the episode, standing at <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> Monk's Cafe.|$|E

2500|$|Chrysta Cherrie of AllMusic {{concluded}} her {{review by}} stating that, [...] "Muppets: The Green Album freshens up the franchise for the newish millennium, and Generation Z listeners will enjoy hearing current artists in this different context, but other listeners may be left reaching for their classic Muppets fare." [...] A Sputnikmusic reviewer said that [...] "too {{few of the}} artists approach the material with the right ideas". Jeremy Frye wrote that the album's potency largely depended on the nostalgia factor; [...] "If you were to see The Green Album sitting on <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> Starbucks and consider making an impulse buy because you love The Muppets, Iâ€™d say go for it. As tributes to significant portions of your childhood go, it could be much worse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's {{encounter}} with the man behind <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> the gas station. [...] "Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, {{a double}} eagle {{surfaced}} again after over 40 years of obscurity, when British coin dealer Stephen Fenton {{was arrested by}} U.S. Secret Service agents during a sting operation at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. Although he initially told investigators he bought the coin over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> his shop, he later changed his story. Under sworn testimony, he insisted the double eagle {{had come from the}} collection of King Farouk, though this could not be verified. Charges against Fenton were subsequently dropped, and he defended his ownership of the coin in court. The case was settled in 2001 when it was agreed that ownership of the double eagle would revert to the United States government, and the coin could then legally be sold at auction. The United States Treasury issued a document to [...] "issue and monetize" [...] the coin, thereby making it a legal-tender gold coin in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Burroughs {{began using}} {{morphine}} and became addicted. He eventually sold heroin in Greenwich Village {{to support his}} habit. Vollmer also became an addict, but her drug of choice was Benzedrine, an amphetamine sold over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>at</b> that time. [...] Because of her addiction and social circle, her husband immediately divorced her after returning from the war. With some urging from Allen Ginsberg, and also perhaps Kerouac, Burroughs became intellectually and emotionally linked with Vollmer and {{by the summer of}} 1945 had moved in with Vollmer and her daughter. In spring 1946, Burroughs was arrested for forging a narcotics prescription. Vollmer asked her psychiatrist, a Dr. Wollberg, to sign a surety bond for Burroughs's release. As part of his release, Burroughs returned to St. Louis under his parents' care, after which he left for Mexico to get a divorce from Ilse Klapper. Meanwhile, Vollmer's addiction led to a temporary psychosis that resulted in her admission to [...] Bellevue Hospital, which endangered the custody of her child. Upon hearing this, Burroughs immediately returned to New York City to gain her release, asking her to marry him. Their marriage was never formalized, but she lived as his common-law wife. They returned to St. Louis to visit Burroughs's parents and then moved with her daughter to Texas. Vollmer soon became pregnant with Burroughs's child. Their son, William S. Burroughs Jr., was born in 1947. The family moved briefly to New Orleans in 1948.|$|E
