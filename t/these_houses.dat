5|$|Jeremiah Fisher {{constructed}} two row houses, {{joined by}} a common wall and constructed of brick laid in a Flemish bond, near the city square in 1817. <b>These</b> <b>houses</b> lay on Second Street and face west onto Constitution Square. Fisher owned and rented <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> until 1850, but after he sold them they were used as tenements until at least the 1940s. The Wilderness Trace Art League and Boyle County Historical Society Museum occupied the row houses, before the park's purchase by the county. It now houses the Danville-Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission of Danville-Boyle County, and the communications department of the Danville Boyle-County Economic Development Partnership.|$|E

5|$|A {{circular}} keep was constructed, {{probably in}} the late-12th century, on the castle's motte, along with two stone gatehouses and towers along the walls. The wooden buildings in the bailey were rebuilt in stone and the construction work spread up onto the inside edges of the ramparts.

5|$|It is {{believed}} by historians that 168, 170 and 172 Denmark Hill {{were designed by}} noted architect and prison designer William Blackburn due their similarity in architectural style to his other buildings.

5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Ashbridge died in 1801. The brothers, John and Jonathan, each {{married in}} 1809, and began {{construction}} on two-storey frame homes {{for their families}} the same year. <b>These</b> <b>houses</b> were completed in 1811, and located west of the present estate. John and Jonathan served as pathmasters of the Kingston Road from 1797 to 1817. Both participated in the War of 1812 and the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. Jonathan's son, Jesse, inherited Part Lot 9 upon his father's death in 1845.|$|E

5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> demolished.|$|E
5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E
5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E

40|$|During the First World War, war {{industry}} workers faced {{a severe}} housing shortage. Therefore, the US government made an intervening housing provision {{for the workers}} through the Emergency Fleet Corporation and the United States Housing Corporation. Many housing estates were built by these organizations, {{and many of them}} adapted the“ garden city” layout. This study explains the significance of <b>these</b> <b>housing</b> estates. It is suggested that the garden city layout was adapted to discourage workers’ turnover during the war by improving their total living conditions and their awareness and self-confidence as respectable citizens of the country. In addition, the increased value of <b>these</b> <b>housing</b> estates in accordance with the garden city model was important for the government in recovering the construction cost of <b>these</b> <b>housing</b> estates...|$|R

5|$|Douglas's elder sister, Elizabeth, {{was born}} in 1827. His younger sisters were Mary Hannah and Emma, who were born in 1832 and 1834 respectively. Mary Hannah died five months before Emma's birth, and Emma herself died in 1848. Douglas married Elizabeth Edmunds, a farmer's {{daughter}} from Bangor-is-y-Coed, Flintshire, on 25 January 1860 in StDunawd's Church in the village, a church he was later to restore. Initially the couple lived over the office at 6Abbey Square, and later they moved next door to No.4. Their five children were born in <b>these</b> <b>houses,</b> John Percy in 1861, Colin Edmunds in 1864, Mary Elizabeth in 1866, Sholto Theodore the following year, and Jerome in 1869. Only two of the children survived to adulthood; Mary Elizabeth died from scarlet fever in 1868, Jerome lived {{for only a few}} days, and John Percy died aged 12 in 1873.|$|E
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E

5|$|The {{peoples of}} early Iron Age Scotland, {{particularly}} {{in the north and}} west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 to 300 with the most imposing structures having been created around the 2ndcentury. The most massive constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5m (21ft) in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland. Despite extensive research, their purpose {{and the nature of the}} societies that created them are still a matter of debate.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during this}} time fraternities began to {{purchase}} and construct houses. During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses; instead, they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds, such as Dawson's Row near the Lawn and boarding houses north of the university. In 1908, the university's Board of Visitors first offered a land lease and a $12,000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house, and many other fraternities followed. Most of these were located {{just north of the}} Rotunda, on Rugby Road, Madison Lane, University Place, and the surrounding streets. Some of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> cost up to $20,000 to build, and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences of the Old South, using elements of Jeffersonian architecture. Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area, with Zeta Psi's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington, and Phi Kappa Psi's house modeled after Carr's Hill. By 1916 most fraternities had built, purchased, or rented a house for their members.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a new keg policy {{was put into}} effect that {{requires}} all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services. According to administrators, the rule change {{was intended as a}} way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety. Some students saw the administration's increasingly strict policies as an attempt to alter social life at Duke. As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as a way to avoid Duke policies. Many of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations. Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers. In the mid-to-late 2000s (decade), the administration made a concerted effort to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially the Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities. In March 2006, the university purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented and subsequently sold them to individual families in an effort to encourage renovations to the properties and to reduce off-campus partying in the midst of residential neighborhoods.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{domestic}} architecture {{had continued}} to develop, with the Normans, having first occupied the older Anglo-Saxon dwellings, rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber. The elite preferred houses with large, ground-floor halls but the less wealthy constructed simpler houses with the halls on the first floor; master and servants frequently {{lived in the same}} spaces. Wealthier town-houses were also built using stone, and incorporated business and domestic arrangements into a single functional design. By the 14th century grander houses and castles were sophisticated affairs: expensively tiled, often featuring murals and glass windows, these buildings were often designed as a set of apartments to allow greater privacy. Fashionable brick began to be used {{in some parts of the}} country, copying French tastes. Architecture that emulated the older defensive designs remained popular. Less is known about the houses of peasants during this period, although many peasants appear to have lived in relatively substantial, timber-framed long-houses; the quality of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> improved in the prosperous years following the Black Death, often being built by professional craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles, many of which date from the late medieval era. In contrast to England, where the wealthy began to move towards more comfortable grand houses, these continued to be built into the modern period, developing into the style of Scottish Baronial architecture in the 19th century, popular amongst the minor aristocracy and merchant class. This building type, often built with defence in mind {{in the form of the}} tower house, was characterised by corbelled turrets and crow-stepped gables marked the first uniquely Scottish mode of building. Ceilings of <b>these</b> <b>houses</b> were decorated with vividly coloured painting on boards and beams, using emblematic motifs from European pattern books or the artist's interpretation of trailing grotesque patterns. The grandest buildings of this type were the royal palaces in this style at Linlithgow, Holyrood, Falkland and the remodelled Stirling Castle, all of which have elements of continental European architecture, particularly from France and the Low Countries, adapted to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl). More modest buildings with continental influences can be seen in the late 15th century western tower of St Mary's parish church, Dundee, and tollbooths like the one at Dunbar.|$|E
