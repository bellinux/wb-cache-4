25|$|With secession, many Quebec nationalists <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{answer to}} Canada's continual {{constitutional}} debate. Marginalized after the Patriotes rebellion of 1837–38, the secessionist option was resurrected as a credible solution {{in the wake}} of the 1960s Quiet Revolution of Quebec. Some politicians see the independence as the normal conclusion of the Quebec struggle for the conservation of its autonomy within the Canadian federal framework. Some see it in a broader perspective of every people's right to self-determination and what they see as the normal evolution of a 400-year-old former French colony that fell victim to the colonial wars between Great Britain and France.|$|E
2500|$|Generally a {{contract}} forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally {{the agreement is}} enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as [...] "consideration", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent {{acting on behalf of}} a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, {{in the context of their}} bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.|$|E

5000|$|Written {{soon after}} the birth of his daughter, Minchin {{described}} the experience as, [...] "the most emotional of my songwriting life.

60|$|If {{anything}} could astonish one at this time, {{it is the}} war that the rulers in Ireland think it proper to carry on against the person whom they call the Pope, and against all his adherents, whenever they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> power of manifesting their hostility. Without in the least derogating from the talents of your theological politicians, or from the military abilities of your commanders (who act on the same principles) in Ireland, and without derogating from the zeal of either, {{it appears to me}} that the Protestant Directory of Paris, as statesmen, and the Protestant hero, Buonaparte, as a general, have done more to destroy the said Pope and all his adherents, in all their capacities, than the junto in Ireland have ever been able to effect. You must submit your fasces to theirs, and at best be contented to follow with songs of gratulation, or invectives, according to your humor, the triumphal car of those great conquerors. Had that true Protestant, Hoche, with an army not infected with the slightest tincture of Popery, made good his landing in Ireland, he would have saved you from {{a great deal of the}} trouble which is taken to keep under a description of your fellow-citizens obnoxious to you from their religion. It would not have a month's existence, supposing his success. This is the alliance which, under the appearance of hostility, we act as if we wished to promote. All is well, provided we are safe from Popery.|$|E

6000|$|Here were evidences of cultivation--a rare {{sight in}} this country--an acre {{or two of}} rich soil studded with last season's dead corn-stalks of the {{thickness}} of your thumb and very wide apart. But in such a land it was a thrilling spectacle. Close to it was a stream, and on its banks a great herd of curious-looking Syrian goats and sheep were gratefully eating gravel. I do not state this as a petrified fact--I only suppose they were eating gravel, because there {{did not appear to}} be any thing else for them to eat. The shepherds that tended them were the very pictures of Joseph and his brethren I have no doubt in the world. They were tall, muscular, and very dark-skinned Bedouins, with inky black beards. They had firm lips, unquailing eyes, and a kingly stateliness of bearing. They wore the parti-colored half bonnet, half hood, with fringed ends falling upon their shoulders, and the full, flowing robe barred with broad black stripes--the dress one sees in all pictures of the swarthy sons of the desert. These chaps would sell their younger brothers if they had a chance, I <b>think.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> manners, the customs, the dress, the occupation and the loose principles of the ancient stock. [They attacked our camp last night, and I bear them no good will.] They had with them the pigmy jackasses one sees all over Syria and remembers in all pictures of the [...] "Flight into Egypt," [...] where Mary and the Young Child are riding and Joseph is walking alongside, towering high above the little donkey's shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Believe me, Gentlemen, the way still {{before you}} is intricate, dark, {{and full of}} perplexed and treacherous mazes. Those who <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> clew may lead {{us out of this}} labyrinth. We may trust them as amply as we think proper; but as they have most {{certainly}} a call for all the reason which their stock can furnish, why should we think it proper to disturb its operation by inflaming their passions? I may be unable to lend an helping hand to those who direct the state; but I should be ashamed to make myself one of a noisy multitude to halloo and hearten them into doubtful and dangerous courses. A conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood. He would feel some apprehension at being called to a tremendous account for engaging in so deep a play without any sort of knowledge of the game. It is no excuse for presumptuous ignorance, that it is directed by insolent passion. The poorest being that crawls on earth, contending to save itself from injustice and oppression, is an object respectable in the eyes of God and man. But I cannot conceive any existence under heaven (which in the depths of its wisdom tolerates all sorts of things) that is more truly odious and disgusting than an impotent, helpless creature, without civil wisdom or military skill, without a consciousness of any other qualification for power but his servility to it, bloated with pride and arrogance, calling for battles which he is not to fight, contending for a violent dominion which he can never exercise, and satisfied to be himself mean and miserable, in order to render others contemptible and wretched.|$|E

The adaptation, which received mixed to negative reviews, deviated from the novel in several significant ways, including its condensing of Cleopatra's relationship with Antony. George has stated that [...] "they 'telescoped' it in the interest of time. They kept the psychology, and they kept the motivation. But they rearranged some things." [...] She also added that she thinks [...] "they did well considering that they had to condense things so much. My book has everything in it - her childhood, her children, her battle strategies.
