5|$|Spirituals were {{primarily}} expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations. In <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 19th century, spirituals spread {{out of the}} U.S. South. In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country. In imitation of this group, gospel quartets arose, followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th-century rise of jackleg and singing preachers, from whence came the popular style of gospel music.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} Western countries, the U.S. is {{becoming}} less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 1980s, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated {{are less likely to}} get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. Disco reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with the middle and lower classes.|$|E

Imported Chinese books were copied at Japanese libraries, but unlike sutra copying {{little is known about the}} actual copying process of Chinese secular works in Japan.

5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's What I Call Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 1980s; this {{is reflected in the}} albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's What I Call Music or the Hits series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so that, from 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed {{no statistically significant}} difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular kind of country music was the Nashville Sound, which was a slick and pop-oriented style. Many musicians {{preferred}} a rougher sound, leading {{to the development of}} the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed by a wave of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E

5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS), {{developed by}} Blizzard Entertainment {{and published by}} Blizzard and Interplay Productions. The MS-DOS version was released on 23 November 1994 and the Macintosh version in early 1996. Sales were fairly high, reviewers were mostly impressed, and the game won three awards and was a finalist for three others. There was a CD re-release, namely version 1.21 (CD version), that didn't have the word-from-the-user-manual copy protection of prior versions. The sequel, , became the main rival to Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer series, and this competition fostered an RTS boom in <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 1990s.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebuilding}} and remodelling {{occurred in the}} late Middle Ages. A chantry chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel {{is located on the}} north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the Vicarage. The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 14th century; the transept followed twenty or thirty years later, according to Trollope. A clerestory was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time.|$|E
5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> <b>to</b> <b>late</b> 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E

50|$|Pontohedyle {{has never}} been found in colder waters despite a well-studied meiofauna and hydrographic {{conditions}} similar to the Mediterranean. The distribution of Pontohedyle might be constrained by ancestry from warm-water adapted animals.
