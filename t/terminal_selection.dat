40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of port choice and container <b>terminal</b> <b>selection</b> for deep-sea container carriers. The paper focuses on the research question: on what basis do deep-sea container operators select container ports (strategy) and container terminals (financial reasons) in the Hamburg-Le Havre range over others? In answering this research question, three dimensions are addressed in detail: the buying decision characteristics; port choice strategy; and <b>terminal</b> <b>selection.</b> The results show that strategic considerations at company level are important. For port choice the most important criteria from a carrier's perspective are: availability of hinterland connections; reasonable tariffs; and immediacy of consumers (large hinterland). In addition to these criteria, shipping lines attach great value to often neglected factors, such as feeder connectivity, environmental issues and the total portfolio of the port. The study reveals that port selection and <b>terminal</b> <b>selection</b> {{are not the same}} with <b>terminal</b> <b>selection</b> criteria mainly depending on: handling speed; handling costs; reliability; and hinterland connections. The analysis also brought forward that the decision making is different per container carrier, per trade and per port type, implying that a one size fits all approach is not relevant...|$|E

40|$|Skeletal myoblast fusion {{in vitro}} {{requires}} {{the expression of}} connexin 43 (Cx 43) gap junction channels. However, gap junctions are rapidly downregulated after the initiation of myoblast fusion in vitro and in vivo. In this study we show that this downregulation is accomplished by two related microRNAs, miR- 206 and miR- 1, that inhibit the expression of Cx 43 protein during myoblast differentiation without altering Cx 43 mRNA levels. Cx 43 mRNA contains two binding sites for miR- 206 /miR- 1 in its 3 ′-untranslated region, {{both of which are}} required for efficient downregulation. While it has been demonstrated before that miR- 1 is involved in myogenesis, in this work we show that miR- 206 is also upregulated during perinatal skeletal muscle development in mice in vivo and that both miR- 1 and miR- 206 downregulate Cx 43 expression during myoblast fusion in vitro.

From {{the perspective of}} shipping lines, Lirn and Beynon (2006) determine the port selection criteria for Nigerian ports, emphasizing efficiency, frequency of ship visits, adequate infrastructure, and quick responses to port users’ needs as significant criteria. The different port selection perspectives of trunk liners and feeder operators are analyzed by Chang et al. (2008) considering the Europe-East Asia and Intra-Asia trade routes. The advancement and convenience of ports, physical and operational ability, and port charges are highly appreciated by trunk liners, whereas feeder operators focus on the operational conditions of shipping lines and marketability.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{economic}} selection indices, {{the relative importance of}} traits in the breeding objective is reflected by their relative economic weighting. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop two economic selection indices for Beefmaster cattle: one for a terminal production system and one for a maternal production system. The terminal index was developed assuming bulls are mated to mature cows with all resulting progeny harvested. The maternal index was developed assuming bulls are mated to a combination of heifers and mature cows, with resulting progeny retained as replacements or sold at weaning. National average prices from 2010 to 2014 were used to establish income and expenses for each system. Economic values were determined by simulating 100, 000 animals using SAS 9. 3 and approximating the partial derivatives of the profit function by perturbing one trait at a time, by one unit, holding the other traits constant at their respective means. Relative economic values for the terminal objective traits hot carcass weight (HCW), marbling score (MS), ribeye area (REA), 12 th-rib fat (FAT) and feed intake (FI) were 91. 29, 17. 01, 8. 38, - 7. 07 and - 29. 66, respectively. Relative economic values for the maternal objective traits calving difficultly direct (CDd), calving difficulty maternal (CDm), weaning weight direct (WWd), weaning weight maternal (WWm), mature weight (MW) and heifer pregnancy (HP) were - 2. 11, - 1. 53, 18. 49, 11. 28, - 33. 46 and 1. 19, respectively. Selection criteria were chosen from expected progeny differences (EPD) currently reported by Beefmaster Breeders United (BBU). Index coefficients for the <b>terminal</b> <b>selection</b> criteria yearling weight (YW), ultrasound ribeye area (UREA), ultrasound 12 th-rib fat (UFAT) and ultrasound intramuscular fat (UIMF) were 1. 715, 0. 806, - 36. 600 and 12. 375, respectively.

40|$|Genomic {{selection}} (GS) {{has been}} adopted by the dairy cattle breeding industry and the opportunity exists to implement this technology in UK beef and sheep breeding. However, these sectors do not appear so readily predisposed to GS implementation. Following an introduction to GS in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 investigated {{the structure of the}} little-studied UK beef breeding sector. This provided estimates of key commercial and pedigree population parameters, for use in modelling genetic gain from GS. Terminal traits were found to be the dominant selection goals, with 85 % of beef-sired commercial matings resulting in progeny being slaughtered at a prime age. Pedigree bulls disseminated the majority of genes in the sector via natural service. The correlation between the <b>terminal</b> <b>selection</b> index (TI) and the sale price of breeding bulls was moderate, suggesting a modest uptake of genetic technology in the sector. Chapter 3 estimated selection intensity for TI, generation interval and the dissemination rate of improved genes in the pedigree Limousin population. In order to predict the genetic gain achievable in using GS in beef and sheep breeding, Chapters 4 to 6 undertook deterministic selection index simulations, incorporating genomic information as correlated traits. In Chapter 4, GS was modelled for terminal beef traits, when incorporating carcass information and accounting for likely genotype by environment interaction. Using a training population of 2000 sires, this concept was predicted to offer 40 % greater genetic gain than existing BLUP selection using pedigree phenotypes. Gene flow methodology projected the commercial value of this gain to offer a substantial return net of genotyping costs. Chapter 5 explored GS for maternal beef traits within the concept of a nucleus breeding scheme. Whilst greater genetic gain was predicted with GS than with conventional BLUP, the economic value of this gain was projected to be too low to justify such a scheme in the UK. Chapter 6 proposed a synergy between computer tomography (CT) phenotypes and GS in sheep breeding. Developing a genomic predictor from male selection candidates with CT phenotypes and conventional performance records was predicted to increase genetic gain by 55 % over BLUP selection without CT traits. Introducing GBV contributed most of the accuracy in this scenario, suggesting that the existing performance recording structure in UK sheep breeding could in the future be replaced by GS using CT. In the general discussion, the potential for GS in other beef and sheep traits was considered {{in the light of the}} outcomes of these simulations. Given the lack of vertical integration in UK beef and sheep sectors, the drivers for implementation of GS are examined. Finally, the options for international cooperation and the possibilities offered by future genotyping technology are considered. It was concluded that implementation of GS incorporating beef carcass phenotypes was merited and could provide a platform for future GS implementation in other novel traits. Sheep GS with CT traits was considered a higher risk strategy, due to the lack of evidence for uptake of existing EBV technology...|$|E

Substitutions at evolutionarily conserved sites can have minimal effect, whereas those at nonconserved positions can have large effects, contrary to the view that the effects of mutations, especially at conserved positions, are predictable.

The upper IP layer, so-called here virtual network layer provides identification of the network layer towards the applications in the mobile terminals, and {{there is only one}} IP address, so tunneling is used over different RATs towards the central tunnel endpoint called Policy Router, which establishes IP tunnels to the mobile terminal via different available RATs to the <b>terminal.</b> The <b>selection</b> of the RAT is performed by the mobile terminal using the proposed user agent for multi-criteria decision making based on the experience from the performance measurements of different RATs performed by the mobile terminal in the given time window in the past.

40|$|Canopy {{temperature}} depression (CTD) {{has been}} used to estimate crop yield and drought tolerance. However, when to measure CTD for the best breeding selection efficacy has seldom been addressed. The objectives of this study were to evaluate CTD as a drought response measure, identify suitable crop stage for measurement and associated molecular markers. CTD was measured using an infrared camera on 59, 62, 69, 73, 76 and 82 days after sowing (DAS) and the grain yield, shoot biomass and harvest index (%). CTD recorded at 62 DAS was positively associated with the grain yield by 40 % and shoot biomass by 27 % and such association diminished gradually to minimum after 76 DAS. Moreover, CTD at 62 DAS also showed similar positive association with the grain yield recorded in two previous years (r = 0. 45 ***, 0. 42 ***). Genome-wide and candidate gene based association analysis had revealed the presence of nine SSR, 11 DArT and three gene-based markers that varied across the six stages of observation. Two SSR markers were associated with CTD through crop phenology or grain yield while the rest were associated only with CTD for computing marker-trait associations (MTAs). The phenotypic variation explained by the markers was the highest at 62 DAS. These results confirm the importance of continued transpiration and the ability of the roots to supply stored soil water under <b>terminal</b> drought. The <b>selection</b> for grain yield through CTD is done best 15 days after the mean flowering time...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates optimal {{trajectory}} tracking for air-to-surface missiles using bank-to-turn {{steering and}} equipped with Doppler-beam-sharpening seekers. The seeker generates a radar {{image of the}} terrain that is continually updated in flight. The guidance problem {{for this type of}} sensor is complex, because constraints must be imposed on the flight path of the missile to ensure that the seeker can obtain adequate crossrange resolution for target recognition and aim-point <b>selection.</b> <b>Terminal</b> position, incidence, and angle constraints are also imposed in the guidance problem. An offline optimal trajectory can be obtained through trajectory optimization techniques that have been presented in previous papers. The focus of this work is on following the precomputed optimal trajectories. The method presented uses a linear quadratic regulator to calculate closed-loop in-flight controls. We also investigate the effectiveness of a preview term based on the prediction of the future trajectory from the current state. Preview control is an optimal tracking method that uses future trajectory samples within a preview window to improve the tracking accuracy. A set of preview gains is computed and is used in addition to the regulator gains. Over the last 2 km of flight, an impact-angle guidance law that minimizes the miss distance and impact-angle error is used to achieve the terminal constraints. The guidance scheme is evaluated for tracking offline Doppler-beam-sharpening trajectories in the presence of modeling errors, sensor noise, and disturbances.

40|$|The B cell antigen {{receptor}} (BCR) signaling cascade is initiated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine based Activation Motif (ITAM) of Ig-α and Ig-β. Signals {{initiated by the}} pre-BCR in pre-B cells and the BCR in immature and mature cells can lead to cell maturation, <b>selection,</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation or cell death. It is still unclear how a single receptor can mediate such a variety of cellular responses. Our aim {{is to develop a}} system for the structural and functional analysis of Ig-α in vivo and to understand its role in B cell development, selection and response. We use retroviral gene transfer to introduce different mb- 1 (Ig-α encoding gene) mutants into hematopoietic stem cells of Ig-α-deficient mice. Transduced cells are reinjected into irradiated recipient mice where they can differentiate into B cells. Here we have focused on the serine and threonine residues of the cytoplasmic region of Ig-α. These residues are phosphorylated upon BCR engagement and studies in cell lines indicated their potential negative regulatory role in BCR signaling. We found that Ig-α deficient hematopoietic stem cells transduced with retroviral vectors containing either the wild-type or a serine/threonine mutated mb- 1 sequence were able to differentiate into IgM expressing cells in vivo. Thus, our data indicate that the serine and threonine residues do not play a dominant role in pre-BCR signaling as pre-B cells and immature B cells expressing serine and treonine mutant Ig-α develop. We {{are in the process of}} testing the effect of these mutations in B cell negative selection and B cell response...|$|R
40|$|Very {{powerful}} {{data base}} management systems (DBMS) now exist which allow medical personnel access to patient record data bases. DBMS's {{make it easy}} to retrieve either complete or abbreviated records of patients with similar characteristics. In addition, statistics on data base records are immediately accessible. However, the price of this power is a large computer with the inherent problems of access, response time, and reliability. If a general purpose, time-shared computer is used to get this power, the response time to a request can be either rapid or slow, depending upon loading by other users. Furthermore, if the computer is accessed via dial-up telephone lines, there is competition with other users for telephone ports. If either the DBMS or the host machine is replaced, the medical users, who are typically not sophisticated in computer usage, are forced to learn the new system. Microcomputers, because of their low cost and adaptability, lend themselves to a solution of these problems. A microprocessor-based intelligent terminal has been designed and implemented at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine to provide a transparent interface between the user and his data base. The intelligent terminal system includes multiple microprocessors, floppy disks, a CRT terminal, and a printer. Users interact with the system at the CRT <b>terminal</b> using menu <b>selection</b> (framing). The system translates the menu selection into the query language of the DBMS and handles all actual communication with the DBMS and its host computer, including telephone dialing and sign on procedures, as well as the actual data base query and response. Retrieved information is stored locally for CRT display, hard copy production, and/or permanent retention. Microprocessor-based communication units provide security for sensitive medical data through encryption/decryption algorithms and high reliability error detection transmission schemes...|$|R
