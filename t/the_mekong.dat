5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, this network extended past Siem Prang and reached <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River near Stung Treng. The next step was the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams {{had little to do with}} the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E
5|$|Thieu then {{authorized}} Operation Cuu Long, {{in which}} ARVN ground forces, including mechanized and armoured units, drove west and northwest up {{the eastern side}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River from 9 May – 1 July. A combined force of 110 Vietnamese Navy and 30 U.S. vessels proceeded up <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> to Prey Veng, permitting IV Corps ground forces to move westward to Phnom Penh and to aid ethnic Vietnamese seeking flight to South Vietnam. Those who did not wish to be repatriated were then forcibly expelled. Surprisingly, North Vietnamese forces did not oppose the evacuation, though they could easily have done so.|$|E
50|$|Given current {{development}} {{trends in}} the region, power demands are expected to rise seven percent per year between 2010 and 2030, yielding a substantial and potentially lucrative energy market. Hydropower is the favoured energy option for <b>the</b> <b>Mekong's</b> riparian countries.|$|R
50|$|Elevations {{range from}} about 500 m to the park's peak at 2094 m. The park {{incorporates}} three rivers which drain into the Mekong: the Nam Tha, Nam Fa and Nam Long. The Nam Tha is <b>the</b> <b>Mekong's</b> first major tributary after entering Laos.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Strategic Hamlet Program and the {{intensified}} military operations of 1962, the events at Ap Bac placed additional pressure on Diem's government because they showed it {{was not prepared to}} cope with the resurgence of the Viet Cong, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> delta.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, France {{attempted}} to reassert control over its colony and conventional military fighting broke out. Thảo {{served with the}} Vietminh in <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta in the far south of Vietnam during the war against French rule from 1946–54. He almost met his end before he had started; he was apprehended by the local communists in Mỹ Tho, who saw his French-style dress and mistook him for a colonial agent. They tied him up and chained him to a block of stone before throwing him into a river to drown. However, Thảo broke free of the weight and swam to safety. Thảo proceeded further south and deeper into <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta {{to the town of}} Vĩnh Long, where he was again arrested by the local Vietminh. Just as Thảo was about to be executed by drowning, one of the communists realised he was a brother of one of their comrades. Thảo was released and rejoined his family, who lived in the region.|$|E

5|$|Lon Nol {{hoped to}} use the Vietnamese as hostages against PAVN/Viet Cong activities, and the {{military}} set about rounding them up into detention camps. That was when the killing began. In towns and villages all over Cambodia, soldiers and civilians sought out their Vietnamese neighbors in order to murder them. On 15 April, the bodies of 800 Vietnamese floated down <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River and into South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2006, Living River Siam began {{training}} other grassroots {{organizations in}} Thai Baan research, {{beginning with the}} Vietnam Rivers Network and expanding to a Chinese group in 2007. In 2008 they worked with the Burma Rivers Network to conduct research on the Salween River. They also assisted a United Nations-funded NGO, <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), with running Thai Baan research in 2004. Living River Siam, along with the MWBP, organizes cross-basin coordination between Thai Baan research groups.|$|E
5|$|By 17 February, the Khmer Republic {{abandoned}} {{attempts to}} reopen <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh {{would have to}} come in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.|$|E

5|$|From 1972 through 1974, {{the war was}} {{conducted}} along FANK's lines of communications {{north and south of}} the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, Duyệt {{became a}} eunuch of the 18-year-old Prince Nguyễn Ánh, {{the nephew of}} the slain Nguyễn Lord and the most {{senior member of the}} family who survived the revolt by the three Tây Sơn brothers, who seized {{southern}} Vietnam from the Nguyễn in 1777. As a result, Nguyễn Ánh and a few loyalists fled into the dense jungles of <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta in the far south. Later, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a Cai Cơ ("Commander") of his bodyguards. From 1777 onwards, the military balance between the Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn fluctuated, as the enemies counterattacked each other frequently.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Diệm {{recalled}} him to Saigon to help {{deal with}} the Hòa Hảo, a religious sect equipped with a private army. The Hòa Hảo was effectively an autonomous entity in <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta, as its private army enforced a parallel administration and refused to integrate into the Saigon administration. While the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) General Dương Văn Minh led the military effort against the Hòa Hảo, Thơ helped to weaken the sect by buying off its warlords.|$|E

5|$|Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer {{is spoken}} by the {{indigenous}} Khmer population of <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta, formerly {{controlled by the}} Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, {{have been forced to}} take Vietnamese names. Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Lon Nol saw Cambodia's {{population}} of 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese as possible hostages to prevent PAVN attacks and ordered their roundup and internment. Cambodian soldiers and civilians then unleashed a reign of terror, murdering thousands of Vietnamese civilians. On 15 April for example, 800 Vietnamese {{men had been}} rounded up at the village of Churi Changwar, tied together, executed, and their bodies dumped into <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> River. They then floated downstream into South Vietnam. Cambodia's actions were denounced by both the North and South Vietnamese governments.|$|E
50|$|Discherodontus ashmeadi, {{commonly}} known as the redtail barb, is a fish native to <b>the</b> lower <b>Mekong</b> river basin in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. It inhabits both <b>the</b> mainstream <b>Mekong</b> and its tributaries, as well as lakes and reservoirs connected to rivers. It grows to 13.6 cm SL. It is present in mixed fisheries but is not an important fishery species.|$|R
50|$|The {{rise of the}} Khmer Rouge made {{it obvious}} that Cambodia {{would be unable to}} {{participate}} in such an organization for the foreseeable future so in April 1977 the other three riparians agreed to the Declaration Concerning <b>the</b> Interim <b>Mekong</b> Committee, which resulted in the establishment of <b>the</b> Interim <b>Mekong</b> Committee in January 1978. The weakened interim organization was only able to study large-scale projects and implement a few small-scale projects, almost exclusively in Thailand; instead the institutional role of the organization shifted largely to data collection. The 1987 Revised Indicative Basin Plan - the high-water mark of the Interim Committee’s activity - scaled back the ambition of the 1970 Plan, envisioning a cascade of smaller dams along <b>the</b> <b>Mekong’s</b> mainstream, divided into 29 projects, 26 of which were strictly national in scope. The Revised Indicative Basin Plan can also be seen as laying the groundwork for Cambodia’s readmission. Indeed, the Supreme National Council of Cambodia requested readmission in June 1991.|$|R

During the Tet Offensive, the 716th MP Battalion fought off a resolute Viet Cong unit determined to take over the US Embassy, while other 18th Brigade units performed similar duties in <b>the</b> <b>Mekong</b> Delta, Bien Hoa, the Central Highlands, and throughout the RVN. The Brigade completed its service in Vietnam and was deactivated on 20 March 1973 in Oakland, California.|$|E
