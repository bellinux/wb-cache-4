40|$|We propose {{two methods}} for the {{disambiguation}} of results in time-delay based detection and {{localization of sound}} sources, when a triangle of microphones is applied for signal acquisition. A standard approach is to create histograms of time differences of arrival (TDOA) for each microphone pair in a triangular array and to create an averaged histogram. But each individual histogram is designed to detect unique orientation of source only within the local range of [−π/ 2, π/ 2]. Hence, taking the average for different pairs is not appropriate and such method suffers from ambiguity of results in {{the full range of}} orientations: [0, 2 π]. Our first proposition is a delay vector transformation method, that combines corresponding delay measurements into vectors and transforms them into a 2 -D space in which a full-range orientation histogram can finally be established and analyzed. In our second method, individual orientation histograms obtained for pairs of microphones are analyzed first and for each detected source <b>two</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>hypotheses</b> are created. Due to a final clustering of the hypothesis set a unique orientation of each source can be estimated. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} full {{description}} of the N-probability density function of the galaxy number density fluctuations. This N-pdf is given in terms, on the one hand, of the cold dark matter correlations and, on the other hand, of the galaxy bias parameter. The method relies on the assumption commonly adopted that the dark matter density fluctuations follow a local non-linear transformation of the initial energy density perturbations. The N-pdf of the galaxy number density fluctuations allows for an optimal estimation of the bias parameter (e. g., via maximum-likelihood estimation, or Bayesian inference if there exists any a priori information on the bias parameter), and of those parameters defining the dark matter correlations, in particular its amplitude (σ). It also provides the proper framework to perform model selection between <b>two</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> The parameters estimation capabilities of the N-pdf are proved by SDSS-like simulations (both, ideal log-normal simulations and mocks obtained from Las Damas simulations), showing that our estimator is unbiased. We apply our formalism to the 7 th release of the SDSS main sample (for a volume-limited subset with absolute magnitudes M - 20). We obtain = 1. 193 ± 0. 074 and σ = 0. 862 ± 0. 080, for galaxy number density fluctuations in cells {{of the size of}} 30 hMpc. Different model selection criteria show that galaxy biasing is clearly favoured. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine the effect of '{{strategic}} moves' (or strategic change) on the likelihood of organizational survival in a population of firms which has undergone radical transformations in its environment. To this end, we propose and test <b>two</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>hypotheses</b> which are the result of two other theoretical perspectives about the consequences of strategic change: the adaptation view (classic strategic management and dynamic capabilities) and the ecological approach. While from the former, in general, it is assumed that strategic change has a positive effect on the likelihood of organizational survival, from the ecological approach, it is frequently argued that attempts at reorganization in general and strategic change in particular tend to be associated with an increase in the likelihood of organizational extinction. The sample used to test the two proposed hypotheses is the Spanish bank population over the period 1983 - 97. The results confirm the positive and significant effect of strategic moves (or strategic change) on the likelihood of organizational survival, in line with the conclusions of the adaptive perspective and other empirical research carried out in different settings. This paper introduces two important methodological innovations: (a) the definition and measurement of 'strategic moves' (or strategic change) by using a new cluster algorithm, the MCLUST; and (b) the control of the non-observable heterogeneity using panel data models for 'probit' regression.

This means that, should the current dynamic persists, cross-regional convergence {{will take place}} only if the differences in technological initial conditions and structural characteristics will be evened out. Moreover, as the pervasiveness of organized crime has been considered as a structural factor, the analysis suggests that technical upgrading together with institutional strengthening should be policy makers 9 ̆ 2 priorities...|$|R

40|$|The <b>competitive</b> {{environment}} <b>hypothesis</b> {{is one of}} {{the basic}} ideas in mainstream economic theory. It states that the competitive process eliminates all economic profits and losses in the long-run so profits do not persist. This article studies the <b>competitive</b> environment <b>hypothesis</b> of 125 Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) quoted anufacturing firms that survived during the period of 2009 : 1 – 2010 : 4, which can be considered as the short-run. Net income after tax to total assets (return on assets [ROA]) and net income after tax to total equity (return on equity [ROE]) are both used as profit measures. Starting with Levin et al. and Im et al. ’s panel unit root tests, pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), panel fixed effects and cross-sectional analysis are employed. The results indicate that <b>competitive</b> environment <b>hypothesis</b> is viable and profits do not persist in the short-run...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} Internet service provider (ISP) bandwidth allocation and pricing problems for a duopoly bandwidth market with <b>two</b> <b>competitive</b> ISPs. According to the contracts between Internet subscribers and ISPs, Internet subscribers can enjoy their services {{up to their}} contracted bandwidth limits. However, in reality, many subscribers may experience the facts that their on-line requests are denied or their connection speeds are far below their contracted speed limits. One {{of the reasons is}} that ISPs accept too many subscribers as their subscribers. To avoid this problem, ISPs can set limits for their subscribers to enhance their service qualities. This paper develops constrained nonlinear programming to deal with this problem for <b>two</b> <b>competitive</b> ISPs. The condition for reaching the equilibrium between the <b>two</b> <b>competitive</b> firms is derived.
