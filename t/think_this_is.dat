5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker if you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of {{the north and west}} sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete (i.e.Peter Walker) and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't want to shoot him. I could have shot a lot more.|$|E
25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E

500|$|Other {{similarities}} {{were discussed}} {{in an article}} by Mat Paget (GameSpot), such {{as the fact that}} both Far Harbor and Autumn Leaves feature the ability to use the character's voice to determine whether they are a robot. Veer noted that he was not upset with the similarities, saying that he takes inspiration from other games too: [...] "I seriously <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> perfectly okay. After all, Autumn Leaves' inspirations are countless ... and being influenced is a natural part of the writing process." [...] Veer said that having the names of modders in the game's credits for acknowledgement would be beneficial. He also said that he was comfortable even if Bethesda did deliberately use content from Autumn Leaves, and wrote that [...] "I honestly thought Bethesda’s staff played Autumn Leaves, had a blast with it, took some things out of it and made their own thing for Far Harbor. ...

500|$|Blair answered, [...] "I {{agree with}} my honourable friend.

I've no doubt this debate will go on for a significant period of time, but I do agree.

500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band.

It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.|$|E
