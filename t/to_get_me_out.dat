500|$|The Aggies {{won only}} one game against seven defeats in 1928. [...] In late November, {{the day after}} a 46–0 loss to Oklahoma, {{newspapers}} reported that [...] "reliable sources" [...] had said Maulbetsch intended to resign. [...] Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor, saying: [...] "I have not resigned. [...] I am aware that a faction here is trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out,</b> but I {{do not intend to}} throw up the sponge." [...] In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: [...] "Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season. [...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game." [...] Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A's coach in football, baseball, and basketball. [...] It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you have to do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

The two spoke quietly, using short and vague language, aware their conversations were likely being monitored. Donati told Ferrara he would get him out; Ferrara pleaded with him not to try anything.

2500|$|By {{the time}} we {{returned}} down Broadway, {{it seemed to me}} that the city was flying before some awful calamity. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be pitching out their furniture, and packing it off." [...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of my log-house; but here, I understand, many persons [...] "move" [...] every year.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{day after}} the wedding, Rev. Charles Smith, District Superintendent of the Northern California District of the Church of the Nazarene, {{contacted}} Norris and advised him that he had no right under Nazarene polity to conduct the wedding of a person who had divorced unless adultery was the grounds, and that he would [...] "unfrock him for marrying a person divorced on grounds outside those recognized by the church". Norris was confident he would be exonerated after Nazarene authorities investigated the situation. On Monday, January 28, 1929, Norris met with Wedge in the bridal suite on the seventh floor of the Hotel Oakland, and quarreled about the wedding. Norris initially refused to file the paperwork for the wedding, as he claimed Wedge had lied to him about the marital status of Holloway, creating the impression that she was a widow. After Wedge threatened to file a mandamus suit against him, Norris filed the paperwork at the hall of records. Wedge indicated that: [...] "To save his own ecclesiastical hide, Norris would like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> on a limb and then saw the limb off". Wedge insisted that even if the church did not recognize the legality of his wedding, that [...] "we are married in the eyes of God and that is enough to satisfy me". Wedge also indicated that while he expected never to be given a pastorate again, that {{he had no intention of}} resigning from the church: [...] "They may keep me from preaching, but they won't kick me out of the church". Wedge planned to train and manage his son, who was a promising amateur boxer, but on January 30, 1929, Hugh informed his father that he had decided not to sign a contract with him, and to remain in high school and then work in a foundry. After this argument with his son, Wedge indicated that he lost control and contemplated throwing himself out of his hotel window to spare his bride anymore humiliation.|$|E
