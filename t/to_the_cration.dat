A presente dissertação "Entre Lumes e Platôs: Movimentos do Corpo-Coletivo-em-Criação (Vivências com o Núcleo Interdisciplinar de Pesquisas Teatrais da Unicamp) " busca compreender possíveis contribuições do LUME à criação de técnicas para o trabalho de ator. Neste trabalho foi possível perceber que tradição, trajetória e técnica são constructos de um plano de consistência da experiência coletiva em teatro. E que este plano de consistência - o processo de experimentação e a contínua criação do corpo-coletivo - reverberará na ética-estética (entendendo estes conceitos como sendo indissociáveis e concomitantes). Em busca de territórios existenciais no campo teatral, foi possível: cartografar a concepção do grupo LUME através da análise de seu projeto escrito por Luís Otávio Burnier; por meio de entrevistas com os atuais integrantes do grupo, mapear relações entre a trajetória e elementos de tradição que o compõe, o tangenciam, o penetram e que transformam a pesquisa técnica do grupo; e ainda, conhecer, identificar, perceber e agrimensar nas entrevistas concedidas pelos integrantes do LUME algumas 'contaminações' que compõem a heterogeneidade do grupo. Com base em estudos conceituais e reflexões sobre as práticas do teatro contemporâneo e com linhas do pensamento filosófico, especialmente contribuições de Gilles Deleuze e Félix Guattari, a experiência da pesquisa se materializa enquanto tensões entre as fronteiras das práticas teatrais e de outras disciplinas.

This present dissertation “Between Lumes and Platôs: Movements of the Collective-Body-in-Creation (Experiences with the Interdisciplinry Nuclear of Theater Research of Unicamp) ” Seeks to understand the possible contributions of Lume in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cration</b> of techniques to the work of actor. In this work was possible to realize that tradition, trahectory and techniques are constructs of a plan consistency of collective experience in theater. And that this plan if consistency – the process of constinous experimentation and creation of the body-collective-will reverberate on the ethical-aesthetic (understanding this concepts as indissociable and concomitant). Searching existential territories in the theater, was possible: to map the conception of Lume through analysis of their project, written by Luis Otávio Burnier; actor’s work through inrerviews with current members of the group, to map relations between trajectory and traditional elements that intergrates it, touch it, penetrate it, and that transforms the group technical research; and ywt, to know, to identify, to percept and measure on the interviews given by memners of the Lume some “contaminations” that compose the group heterogeneity. Based on conceptual studies and reflections on the practies of contemporary theater, with line of philosophical thought, especially the Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari thought, the experience of the research is materialized as tensions between the between the boundaries of theatrical practice and other disciplines...|$|E

40|$|The {{realistic}} {{drawing of}} the human anatomy is a basic lesson in the academic teaching {{of the field of}} visual communication design. This lesson is very important for <b>the</b> <b>cration</b> of illustration, design and as well animation. It is an intresting fact that American graphics novels like the ones of Marvel and Japanese Manga comics have a visible influence of how the human body is portrayed in drawings. While American Comics in Indonesia in the 1970 s, Japanese manga, which entered Indonesia in the Mid- 90 s, seems <b>to</b> taking over <b>the</b> leading role in Indonesia nowadays. The influence of American Comic art on Indonesian comic art was a more pronounced realistic portraying of the human body while Japanese manga had the opposite effect, the human body was portrayed in more distorted way. This development also shows how students of visual communication design actually draw and therefor perceive the human body. For these student, the human body they use in illustration and advertisement in based on the archetype of Japanese Manga art. With this development in mind Universities in the field of visual Communication design are advised in their curriculum <b>to</b> emphasize <b>the</b> teaching of a more realistic style in portraying of the human anatomy. With these efforts students willable to create illustrations, advertisement comic and animations which are both fascinating and imaginative...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Comparison {{is made of}} petrological and geochemical features in the Ooldea 2 drill core with metasedimentary and meta-igneous outcrop at Lake Ifould, in <b>the</b> NW Gawler <b>Cration.</b> <b>The</b> predominant lithologies from the Lake Ifould area are granodiorite gneiss, granite gneiss and leucogneiss, {{all of which are}} intrusive in origin and Proterozoic in age. Calc-silicate outcrops as xenoliths within the leucogneiss and is possibly Archaean in age. The Lake Ifould area experienced a tight to isoclinal fold event followed by a regional deformation event which occurred after the intrusion of the granitic gneiss. The regional defamation is of variable intensity manifested by zones of low- and high-strain within the region. Geothermometry suggests temperatures of 400 degC; pressures are indeterminate. Garnet gneiss outcropping 10 kilometres north of Lake Ifould indicates temperatures and pressures of 550 degC and 2. 5 kb from geothermometry and geobarometry estimations. Ooldea 2 drill core has peak assemblages indicating temperatures of 950 - 1000 degC and pressures of 8 - 10 kb. Preservation of these high-pressure and high-temperature assemblages indicates isobaric cooling of the Ooldea 2 assemblages has occurred over an extensive period of time. Chemical similarity of the Lake Ifould meta-intrusives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Donnington Granitoid Suite of the Lincoln Complex suggests tentative correlation. By contrast, the Ooldea 2 metasediments are most similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mt Christie banded iron formation suggesting classification as Mulgathing Complex. The garnet gneiss is most geochemically similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carnot Gneiss which also suggests correlation with the Mulgathing Complex. The garnet gneiss possibly represents the country rock of the Lake Ifould intrusives. The Archaean basement and the Proterozoic basement {{are most likely to be}} separated by a fault. This would explain the contrasting pressure-temperature conditions from the different areas; uplift from a relatively shallow depth in the Lake Ifould area and differential uplift of the Ooldea metasediments after isobaric cooling at great crustal depth.
