5|$|The town of Calais had {{contemplated}} {{a historical}} monument for decades when Rodin {{learned of the}} project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so that the Jews of Trieste could live together with <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the Jews of Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E

25|$|Butare Province was an {{exception}} to the local violence. Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana was the only Tutsi prefect, and the province was the only one dominated by an opposition party. Opposing the genocide, Habyarimana was able to keep relative calm in the province, until he was deposed by the extremist Sylvain Ndikumana. Finding the population of Butare resistant to murdering <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens,</b> the government flew in militia from Kigali by helicopter, and they readily killed the Tutsi.|$|E
25|$|Dā'ī Zoeb {{appointed}} Maulai Yaqoob (after {{the death}} of Maulai Abdullah), who was the second Walī al-Hind of the Fatimid dawat. Moulai Yaqoob {{was the first person}} of Indian origin to receive this honour under the Dā'ī. He was the son of Moulai Bharmal, minister of Hindu Solanki King Jayasimha Siddharaja (Anhalwara, Patan). With Minister Moulai Tarmal, they had honoured the Fatimid dawat along with <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> on the call of Moulai Abdullah. Syedi Fakhruddin, son of Moulai Tarmal, was sent to western Rajasthan, India, and Moulai Nuruddin went to the Deccan (death: Jumadi al-Ula 11 at Don Gaum, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India).|$|E
25|$|There are {{accounts}} of protection {{offered to the}} minorities by <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Reşat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli's Muhasebeciler Street, which was {{right next to the}} rally point, İstanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some of his neighbors in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform. The boys in the neighborhood joined him, bringing domestic implements as substitute weapons. The mob passed by after seeing the barricade.|$|E

60|$|The sages of {{the council}} {{unanimously}} agreed with the opinion of their provost and town clerk, and resolved, in all formality, to petition the King, {{as a matter of}} right, that the murder of <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizen</b> should be inquired into according to this ancient form, which was held to manifest the truth, and received as matter of evidence in case of murder so late as {{towards the end of the}} 17th century.

50|$|In 1281 he {{was with}} the Guelphs of Siena who were besieging <b>their</b> Ghibelline <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> in the Torri di Maremma, near Roccastrada, Tuscany, and he was fined many times for deserting the {{battlefield}} without permission. He was fined again on July 11, 1282, for violating the curfew of Siena, signalled by the third ringing of the commune bells. Cecco was fined again in 1291 under similar circumstances.|$|R
25|$|I {{wanted the}} whole country to know in detail what had {{happened}} at that factory, and to understand what had gone on there—the fruitless...lack of enforcement by the Department of Labor, the whole long lousy history of neglect, deceit and stupidity—was happening in dozens of other ways, in hundreds of other factories, to thousands of other men across the land. I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted them to know that murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one was bothering about it.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the liberation}} of 1945, {{allegations}} of collaboration with the occupying authorities were investigated. By November 1946, the UK Home Secretary {{was in a position}} to inform the House of Commons that most of the allegations lacked substance. Only 12 cases of collaboration were considered for prosecution, but the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled out prosecutions on insufficient grounds. In particular, it was decided that there were no legal grounds for proceeding against those alleged to have informed to the occupying authorities against <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens.</b> The only trials connected to the occupation of the Channel Islands to be conducted under the Treachery Act 1940 were against individuals from among those who had come to the islands from Britain in 1939–1940 for agricultural work, these included conscientious objectors associated with the Peace Pledge Union and people of Irish extraction.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{reveal that}} France seems to be, among the Western countries, {{the one where}} Muslims {{integrate}} the best and feel the most for their country. French Muslims also have the most positive opinions about <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> of different faiths. The study from the Pew Research Center on Integration {{is an example of}} works revealing this typically French phenomenon. In Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region where French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, the vast majority rejects violence and say they are loyal to France according to studies by Euro-Islam, a comparative research network on Islam and Muslims in the West sponsored by GSRL Paris/CNRS France and Harvard University. On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily Le Monde indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A thorough survey by the Pew Research Center in Spring 2014 revealed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a favourable opinion.|$|E
50|$|The work, also, {{evaluates the}} {{differences}} between Northern-Central Italy and Southern Italy. Around 1000 A.D. Northern Italy and Central Italy had a more active civil society, with many citizens taking part in politics and social gatherings in their communities. Northern-Central Italians had a mutual trust for <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizen,</b> governing horizontally. Politics was less hierarchical in their region. Southern Italy, however, {{was very different from}} its Northern-Central counterpart; a group of Norman Mercenaries created order in the area. The governing structure was much more vertical: the peasants were controlled by the knights and the knights were controlled by the kings. Northern and Central Italy created a democratic-type system for their citizens. Conversely, Southern Italy created a feudal and autocratic system of governing. Putnam concludes that these long-standing differences still help to explain North-South differences in governance, many centuries later.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} as a poor man {{approaches}} the editor of Sandesh with a journal by Professor Shanku, a scientist who was disappeared 15 years ago. The editor learned from the diary that the scientist, despite being mocked by his neighbour Abinashbabu was getting prepared for a voyage to Mars. He also invented a robot that he called Bidhushekhar. Later the Professor, along with Bidhushekhar, his servant Prahlad and his pet cat Newton, landed in Mars, where they were attacked by an army of Martians. They escaped from Mars and subsequently lost their way in space. After many days of wondering, they arrived in Tafa, an unknown planet inhabited by the “first civilised humans of the solar system.” Unlike the Martians, the inhabitants of Tafa welcomed the strangers in a hearty manner and made Professor Shanku <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizen.</b> The editor wanted to publish the journal in his magazine, but later copying the contents he found the diary was destroyed by a swarm of ants.|$|R
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Danes was significant, as their {{government}} gained access to the ghetto for the International Red Cross in 1944, to view conditions there. (This took place after the D-Day Invasion of Normandy by the Allies). Most European governments, when occupied by the Nazis, had not tried to protect <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> Jewish <b>citizens.</b> Historians believe the Germans were {{trying to keep the}} Danes satisfied as they had impressed many of their workers in war factories.|$|R
500|$|Like {{the tragic}} protagonists of Greek drama, the Greek athlete had a [...] "larger than life" [...] quality. [...] At Olympia, for example, {{they were set}} apart from the general {{population}} for lengthy training periods and the observation of a complex series of prohibitions that included abstinence from intercourse. Once training was completed and the athletes were brought before <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> trim, fit, nude and shimmering with oil, they must have appeared semi-divine.|$|E
500|$|The Zox Commission further {{recommended}} {{increasing the}} role of medical doctors at the asylums and that [...] "Medical men have the sole and exclusive right to determine whether <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> are sane or insane. The medical expert therefore stands {{in the position of}} witness, jury and judge". [...] Prior to (and in some instances, for a time after) the Zox Commission, many superintendents at asylums did not have any training in insanity.|$|E
500|$|In the report, Smyth {{called it}} [...] "a {{semi-technical}} report {{which it is}} hoped men of science in this country can use to help <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> in reaching wise decisions" [...] in the new Atomic Age. At the urging of his superiors, he removed several discussions of the bomb's moral implications and its creators' unease. Rebecca Press Schwartz argues that Smyth's academic background and his report's security-driven focus on physics {{at the expense of}} engineering caused the Smyth Report to promote a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily an achievement of physicists.|$|E

25|$|Spartan {{women were}} also literate and numerate, {{a rarity in}} the ancient world. Furthermore, {{as a result of}} their {{education}} and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> (male) <b>citizens,</b> they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public. Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women's curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato goes on to praise Spartan women's ability when it came to philosophical discussion.|$|R
500|$|The Thebans {{have also}} {{been the subject of}} some discussion. Herodotus {{suggests}} they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes. However, as Plutarch long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away {{with the rest of the}} Greeks? The likelihood is that these were the Theban [...] "loyalists", who unlike the majority of <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens,</b> objected to Persian domination. They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia. The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.|$|E
500|$|Süß {{suggests}} to the Duke {{that the two}} of them go to Ludwigsburg on the pretext of meeting the emperor's emissary and return to Württemberg only after the planned coup has established him as an absolute monarch. However, before the foreign mercenaries arrive to effect Süß's coup, the people of Württemberg rise up under the leadership of Obrist Röder. The Württemberg soldiers refuse to fire on <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens</b> and several of the townspeople go to Ludwigsburg to confront the Duke and Süß. As they are presenting their grievances, the Duke suffers a fatal heart attack. Süß is taken into custody by the rebels and subjected to a lengthy trial on charges that include treason and financial improprieties. However, he is ultimately convicted primarily on the charge that he had sex with a Christian woman. Süß is executed, pleading to the last that he was nothing more than a [...] "faithful servant" [...] of the late Duke. All the other Jews are then given three days to leave Württemberg. As the film draws to a close, a citizen of Württemberg, observing the Jews leave, comments, [...] "May the citizens of other states never forget this lesson." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of the {{dictator}} novel concerns the use of writing as a medium of power. In , Asturias uses language to challenge dictatorial power. Throughout the novel the reader observes {{the authority of the}} President over the people through his control of what they write. In the chapter [...] "The President's Mail-Bag", a stream of letters informs the President of peoples' actions. While many are [...] "writing the truth" [...] and turning in <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>citizens,</b> many others feel that [...] "it is not safe to trust to paper". Writing is closely linked to authority and is a means to solidify power, because language can be manipulated into lies that eventually kill. For example, the President orders a newspaper to include the false statement that he attended the wedding of Camila, the daughter of General Canales. When the General reads these words and perceives them as truth, his heart is broken and he subsequently dies. Miguel Angel Face is also killed by the manipulation of words: he is told that Camila has become the President's mistress, and upon hearing this falsified news, he loses the will to live. These episodes in the novel demonstrate how closely language, the written word, and power are linked. The characters in [...] lose their sense of reality, making {{it difficult for them to}} know who to trust. As Rosello argues, [...] "in this state of terror, language is deliberately used as a means of seducing the addressee into harmlessness, and has lost its function of conveying information".|$|E

5000|$|At this time, Pressel {{endeavored}} {{to learn more}} about the culture of the Turks; rumors abounded of torture and barbarism, especially toward Ottoman Christians, a minority. He found these rumors to be true; the perpetrators of various crimes against the Christians were often government officials, so their plight seemingly had no end. As Pressel continued to learn about the Turks, he disliked Turkish officials more and more. The majority of Turks [...] "were honest and brave and treated <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> Christian <b>citizens</b> 'with mildness and friendliness.'" [...] On the other hand, Turkish officials were caught between the modern and traditional, hypocritical, and soon came to disgust Pressel.|$|R
