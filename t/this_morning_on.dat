5|$|September 3rd – I {{went and}} saw the whole south part of the City burning from Cheapeside to the Thames, and... was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the {{scaffolds}} contributed exceedingly.September 7th – I went <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> foote from White-hall as far as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by St. Paules... At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E

500|$|Santer {{said there}} were three big clues to the killer's identity, [...] "one in the Christmas Day episode, one more {{recently}} than Christmas and there's another one that, if I were to tell you where it was, would perhaps give it away too easily," [...] however, in a chat with Sharon Marshall shown on <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> 18 February 2010, he said the second clue was about halfway through the investigation and the third was [...] "on screen but not necessarily in the programme". He {{also said that the}} outcome would be [...] "surprising", [...] "satisfying" [...] and [...] "in retrospect, inevitable", adding that [...] "it makes sense". Santer confirmed the clues in an interview on the EastEnders website: on Christmas Day Stacey disappears and it is never explained why, and then reappears on Boxing Day appearing [...] "not quite with it"; Stacey is the only character still sufficiently angry enough to spit on Archie's grave at his funeral; and Stacey is the first character to feature in the Christmas Day trailers.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by {{the first week of}} live shows of The X Factor (UK) where Little Mix were the favourites to be eliminated and felt disheartened by hearing the odds in the show's green room. Group member Jesy Nelson also recalled, [...] "the paps waiting outside to shoot us were all shouting 'See you on <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> Monday' because that's where the losers go. I was like: 'Oh, right, thanks!'" [...] Further inspiration came from Nelson who as an aspiring singer was told by her teachers that she would end up working at Tesco. Little Mix also wrote the song as an uplifting message for their fans. Nelson said, [...] "There's nothing wrong with writing songs about clubs and partying but I think it's cool to do a song with meaning." [...] Prior to [...] "Wings", the group had been vocal about standing up to bullying and wanted the song to have a similar message that listeners would be able to relate to. However, they did not want it to sound cheesy or as if they were preaching and instead wrote it with a theme of maternal advice.|$|E

2500|$|During the station's {{first decade}} with CBS, newscasts were added and dropped from KTVT's schedule. Channel 11 would first expand news {{programming}} with {{the debut of}} half-hour weekday newscasts at noon and 5:00p.m. in February 1996. In January 1999, it added a 6:30p.m. newscast on weeknights {{as a replacement for}} Hard Copy (which had been airing on KTVT since September 1997, when the program moved to the station from KDFW); the newscast was later replaced in September 2000 by Hollywood Squares (which had previously aired on WFAA from the revival series' September 1998 premiere until June 2000). Concurrent with the discontinuance of Hard Copy following its cancellation, the station debuted an hour-long 4:00p.m. newscast on September 11 of that year; after the program's initial cancellation in September 2002, KTVT restored that newscast in January 2004 (later reducing it to a half-hour broadcast in September 2005, before expanding it to an hour once more on January 11, 2010). The noon newscast returned in September 2005, but was subsequently cancelled the following month after it moved Jeopardy! from its previous 4:30p.m. timeslot to 11:00a.m. (KTVT would eventually restore a midday news program, with the debut of a half-hour 11:00a.m. newscast on August 12, 2013, which replaced Jeopardy! after the game show was moved to KTXA). In September 2006, due to budget cuts imposed by CBS Corporation, KTVT discontinued its morning newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays, making it the only [...] "Big Four" [...] network station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market that did not have a weekend morning newscast for the next eight years until KTVT launched hour-long weekend editions of CBS 11 News <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> both days on September 20, 2014.|$|E
