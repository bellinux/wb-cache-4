The sea is the sailor's <b>true</b> <b>element,</b> and Marlow, lingering on shore, was to me an object of incredulous commiseration like a bird, which, secretly, should have lost its faith in the high virtue of flying.|$|E

6000|$|Holbach had {{not clearly}} thought out the growth, the changes, varieties, and transformations among moral ideals. He was, of course, {{far too much}} in the full current of the eighteenth century not to feel that exultation in life and its most exuberant manifestations, which the {{conventional}} moralists of the theological schools had set down and proscribed as worldliness and fleshliness. [...] "Action," [...] he says in this very chapter; [...] "action is the <b>true</b> <b>element</b> of the human mind; no sooner does man cease to act, than he falls into pain and weariness of spirit." [...] No doubt this is too absolutely stated, if we are to take some millions of orientals into our account of the human mind, but it has been true of the nations of the west. Yet the recognition of this law did not prevent the writer from occasionally falling into some of the old canting commonplaces about people being happiest who have fewest wants. As if, on the contrary, that action which he describes as the <b>true</b> <b>element</b> of man, were not directly connected with the incessant multiplication of wants. We may take this, however, as a casual lapse into the common form of moralists of ascetic ages. In substance the System of Nature is essentially a protest against ascetic and quietist ideals.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Kittridge and Sally {{were soon}} {{accommodated}} with seats, and Zephaniah Pennel and the Captain began trimming sail. The day {{was one of}} those perfect gems of days which are to be found only in the jewel-casket of October, a day neither hot nor cold, with an air so clear that every distant pine-tree top stood out in vivid separateness, and every woody point and rocky island seemed cut out in crystalline clearness against the sky. There was so brisk a breeze that the boat slanted quite to the water's edge on one side, and Mara leaned over and pensively drew her little pearly hand through the water, and thought of the days when she and Moses took this sail together--she in her pink sun-bonnet, and he in his round straw hat, with a tin dinner-pail between them; and now, to-day the ship of her childish dreams was to be launched. That launching was something she regarded almost with superstitious awe. The ship, built on one element, but designed to have its life in another, seemed an image of the soul, framed and fashioned with many a weary hammer-stroke in this life, but finding its <b>true</b> <b>element</b> only when it sails out into the ocean of eternity. Such was her thought as she looked down the clear, translucent depths; but would it have been of any use to try to utter it to anybody?--to Sally Kittridge, for example, who sat all in a cheerful rustle of bright ribbons beside her, and who would have shown her white teeth all round at such a suggestion, and said, [...] "Now, Mara, who but you would have thought of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Seventeen or {{eighteen}} {{centuries ago}} this Coliseum was the theatre of Rome, and Rome was {{mistress of the}} world. Splendid pageants were exhibited here, in presence of the Emperor, the great ministers of State, the nobles, and vast audiences of citizens of smaller consequence. Gladiators fought with gladiators and at times with warrior prisoners from many a distant land. It was the theatre of Rome--of the world--and the man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintentional manner something about [...] "my private box at the Coliseum" [...] could not move in the first circles. When the clothing-store merchant wished to consume the corner grocery man with envy, he bought secured seats {{in the front row}} and let the thing be known. When the irresistible dry goods clerk wished to blight and destroy, according to his native instinct, he got himself up regardless of expense and took some other fellow's young lady to the Coliseum, and then accented the affront by cramming her with ice cream between the acts, or by approaching the cage and stirring up the martyrs with his whalebone cane for her edification. The Roman swell was in his <b>true</b> <b>element</b> only when he stood up against a pillar and fingered his moustache unconscious of the ladies; when he viewed the bloody combats through an opera-glass two inches long; when he excited the envy of provincials by criticisms which showed that he had been to the Coliseum many and many a time and was long ago over the novelty of it; when he turned away with a yawn at last and said, ...|$|E

I am very sorry, René, for there was a good deal to like about him, he was a gentleman and a chivalrous one. In Minette he saw not a clever model, but a peerless woman, and was carried away by enthusiasm, which is, I think, perfectly real: she is in her <b>true</b> <b>element</b> now, and is, I should say, for once not acting. Well, it is a bad business. If the Commune triumphs, as I own that it seems likely enough, it will do, he will in time become disgusted with the adventurers and ambitious scoundrels by whom he is surrounded, and will, like the Girondists, be among the first victims of the wild beasts he has helped to bring into existence. If the troops prove faithful, the Commune will be crushed, and all those who have made themselves conspicuous are likely to have but a short shrift of it when martial law is established. Well, René, as there is nothing that can be done in the matter, it is of no use troubling about it. None of the others have gone that way, I suppose." ...|$|E

A thousand spots with which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons which satisfied me, in the end, that he was right.

6000|$|... "As to {{the books}} which you--whom I know so little of--should read, {{there is hardly}} {{anything}} definite that can be said. For one thing, you may be strenuously advised to keep reading. Any good book, any book that is wiser than yourself, will teach you something--a great many things, indirectly and directly, if your mind be open to learn. This old counsel of Johnson's is also good, and universally applicable:--'Read the book you do honestly feel a wish and curiosity to read.' The very wish and curiosity indicates that you, then and there, are the person likely to get good of it. 'Our wishes are presentiments of our capabilities;' that is a noble saying, of deep encouragement to all true men; applicable to our wishes and efforts in regard to reading as to other things. Among all the objects that look wonderful or beautiful to you, follow with fresh hope the one which looks wonderfullest, beautifullest. You will gradually find, by various trials (which trials see that you make honest, manful ones, not silly, short, fitful ones), what is for you the wonderfullest, beautifullest--what is your <b>true</b> <b>element</b> and province, {{and be able to}} profit by that. True desire, the monition of nature, is much to be attended to. But here, also, you are to discriminate carefully between true desire and false. The medical men tell us we should eat what we truly have an appetite for; but what we only falsely have an appetite for we should resolutely avoid. It is very true; and flimsy, desultory readers, who fly from foolish book to foolish book, and get good of none, and mischief of all--are not these as foolish, unhealthy eaters, who mistake their superficial false desire after spiceries and confectioneries for their real appetite, of which even they are not destitute, though it lies far deeper, far quieter, after solid nutritive food? With these illustrations, I will recommend Johnson's advice to you.|$|E
60|$|When {{he looked}} back at his year of court and camp, he could only marvel at having ever {{preferred}} them. In war his want of bodily strength would make real distinction impossible; here he felt himself excelling; here was absolute enjoyment, and of a kind without drawback. Scholarship must be his <b>true</b> <b>element</b> and study: the deep universal study of the sisterhood of science that the University offered was his veritable vocation. Surely it was not without significance that the ring that shone on his finger betrothed him to Esclairmonde, the Light of the World; for though in person the maiden was never to be his own, she was the emblem to him of the pure virgin light of truth and wisdom that he would be for ever wooing, and winning only to see further lights beyond. Human nature felt a pang at the knowledge that he was bound to deliver up the ring and resign his connection with that fair and stately maiden; but the pain that had been sore at first had diminished under the sense that he stood in a post of generous trust, and that his sacrifice was the passport to her grateful esteem. He knew her to be with Lady Montagu, awaiting a vacancy at St. Katharine's, and this would be the signal for dissolving the contract of marriage, after which his present vision was to bestow Lilias upon Patrick, make over his estates to them, take minor orders, and set forth for Italy, there to pursue those deeper studies in theology and language for which Padua and Bologna were famous. It was many months since he had heard of Lilias; but this did not give him any great uneasiness, for messengers were few, and letter-writing far from being a common practice. He had himself written at every turning-point of his life, and sent his letters when the King communicated with Scotland; but from his sister he had heard nothing.|$|E
60|$|Though {{the author}} {{of some of the}} most {{tremendous}} and far-sounding phrases of an epoch that was only too rich in them, yet phrases had no empire over him; he was their master, not their dupe. Of all the men who succeeded Mirabeau as directors of the unchained forces, we feel that Danton alone was in his <b>true</b> <b>element.</b> Action, which poisoned the blood of such men as Robespierre, and drove such men as Vergniaud out of their senses with exaltation, was to Danton his native sphere. When France was for a moment discouraged, it was he who nerved her to new effort by the electrifying cry, 'We must dare, and again dare, and without end dare!' If his rivals or his friends seemed too intent on trifles, too apt to confound side issues with the central aim of the battle, Danton was ever ready to urge them to take a juster measure:--'When the edifice is all ablaze, I take little heed of the knaves who are pilfering the household goods; I rush to put out the flames.' When base egoism was compromising a cause more priceless than the personality of any man, it was Danton who made them ashamed by the soul-inspiring exclamation, 'Let my name be blotted out and my memory perish, if only France may be free.' The Girondins denounced the popular clubs of Paris as hives of lawlessness and outrage. Danton warned them that it were wiser to go to these seething societies and to guide them, than to waste breath in futile denunciation. 'A nation in revolution,' he cried to them, in a superb figure, 'is like the bronze boiling and foaming and purifying itself in the cauldron. Not yet is the statue of Liberty cast. Fiercely boils the metal; have an eye on the furnace, or the flame will surely scorch you.' If there was murderous work below the hatches, that was all the more reason why the steersman should keep his hand strong and ready on the wheel, with an eye quick for each new drift in the hurricane, and each new set in the raging currents. This is ever the figure under which one conceives Danton--a Titanic shape doing battle with the fury of the seas, yielding while flood upon flood sweeps wildly over him, and then with unshaken foothold and undaunted front once more surveying the waste of waters, and striving with dexterous energy to force the straining vessel over the waters of the bar.|$|E

She adds color artificially to the pictures, covering or emphasizing parts that are most important. The color, which was the original and <b>true</b> <b>element,</b> is recreated.

A reoccurring theme in all her work was the tragedy in having to give up forbidden love, though this was also something necessary {{to do in the}} end.

In her novel Förhoppningar (Hopes), the hero of the story was the sixteen-year-old stepson and his former stepmother, the widow Ottilia, which was a controversial combination in the 19th-century.

50|$|The horologe is {{the most}} {{fascinating}} feature of the Town Hall, it was first built {{in the first decade}} of the 15th century. In 1410 its first version was constructed by the skilled clockmaker Nicholas of Kadaň in collaboration with the astronomer Jan Šindel. Later reconstructions changed the first horologe completely, but written records confirm the it already possessed all basic features. The first far-reaching reconstruction was undertaken in 1490 by the clockmaster Hanuš, an old town locksmith, who produced an excellent timepiece based on the pendulum system. The architectural decoration date is from this time, too. This consisted of a system of slender late-Gothic columns that framed it and rich plastic decorations of both figural and floral motifs. There are a lot of stories about the horologe but the only <b>true</b> <b>element</b> is probably the part about the clockwork not functioning properly. At that time there were only few clockmasters skilful enough to keep such a complicated timepiece in order and this is evidently also the reason why after master Hanuš's death the horologe stopped. The learned Jan Táborský of Klokotská Hora repaired and perfected the Old Town horologe in the years 1552-1572. His adjustments have survived the passing of the years and though some changes were made in the external appearance of the horologe, its fundamental features have remained unchanged. The most recent repairs were made out after the Second World War when the badly damaged original figures were replaced by Vojtěch Sucharda's charming statues.|$|E
40|$|The fate of {{defendants}} facing lengthy federal sentence enhancements often {{turns on}} what the U. S. Supreme Court calls the categorical approach. The approach controls whether a federal defendant might face an additional decade or longer in prison based solely on having prior convictions of a certain type. At {{a time when many}} question the wisdom of mass incarceration, the Court has taken great care to delimit the circumstances in which a federal sentencing judge can lengthen sentences based on recidivism. The categorical approach also governs most immigration cases involving deportation for a crime. As Congress has cut back deportation defenses for lawful permanent residents with criminal records, the Court has demanded that convictions used for deportation strictly correspond to a federal removal ground. In both Descamps v. United States and Mathis v. United States, recent Armed Career Criminal Act opinions authored by Justice Kagan, the Supreme Court interpreted the categorical approach as requiring a <b>true</b> <b>elements</b> test, declaring that at least two decades of the Court’s precedent required this result. Yet, Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, two justices {{who had been in the}} majority in Descamps, dissented in Mathis. This article analyzes the trajectory of the Court’s categorical approach decisions, using the Mathis dissent authored by Justice Breyer and joined by Justice Ginsburg, to explain an ambiguity in the Court’s jurisprudence that Descamps and Mathis have now settled. Justice Kagan’s penchant for oversimplification has led her not only to overstate the relationship between the Court’s early and late categorical approach decisions but to include a discussion in Mathis that leaves room for confusion about how to apply the categorical approach in practice. This dictum suggests that adjudicators can take a “peek” at the record of conviction to help determine whether state law has defined a fact as a means or element. This article argues that Descamps and Mathis require the categorical approach to operate like a <b>true</b> <b>elements</b> test and that the take a “peek” suggestion in Mathis is inconsistent with the case’s holding...|$|R

40|$|Velocity of {{a moving}} {{body is a}} {{paradigmatic}} case of vector. In this paper {{it is argued that}} this conception of velocity was originally introduced by Leibniz in the context of his critique of Cartesian principles of motion. In Cartesian metaphysics velocity of a moving body is a strictly positive scalar, independent from its direction. As a result of an impact, a body can change its direction and preserve its velocity; such a change would immediately falsify the principle of continuity. In order to save the principle of continuity, Leibniz revised the notion of velocity and reduced the direction of movement to a class of newly conceived directed velocity. It is further shown that negative properties are not allowed in Leibnizian metaphysics. To reconcile the principle of continuity with apparent leaps, Leibniz was forced to deny the existence of atoms: he claimed that the monads, or the <b>true</b> <b>elements</b> of things, had to be indestructible and immaterial...|$|R
