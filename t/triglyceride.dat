5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma <b>triglyceride</b> levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in <b>triglyceride</b> catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the methods of}} measuring specific heat capacity of <b>triglycerides</b> using differential scanning calorimeter, DSC. The optimum operating conditions for specific heat capacity determination of <b>triglycerides</b> using the heat flux differential scanning calorimeter, is first established. Operating, conditions such as scanning rate, sample weight and atmospheric condition seemed to affect the specific heat capacity value considerably. The specific heat capacity of pure <b>triglycerides</b> are then determine using these optimum operating conditions. The pure <b>triglycerides</b> used in the experiment are four simple <b>triglycerides</b> and three mixed <b>triglycerides.</b> The four simple <b>triglycerides</b> used are trilaurin, trimyristin, tripalmitin and tristearin. The mixed <b>triglycerides</b> used are 1, 2 -dimyristoyl- 3 -oleoyl, 1, 2 -dimyristol- 3 -palmitoyl and 1, 2 - dioleoyl- 3 -palmitoyl. Comparisons of the specific heat capacity results are made with the reported values and values calculated for <b>triglycerides</b> using estimation methods. The accuracy of the specific heat capacity results for trglycerides are within 95 % using DSC methods...|$|R

5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, <b>triglyceride</b> metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma <b>triglyceride</b> levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma <b>triglyceride</b> levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{isolated}} high LDL and clinical criteria (which differ by country), genetic testing for LDL receptor mutations and ApoB mutations can be performed. Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80% of cases; those without a mutation often have higher <b>triglyceride</b> levels and may in fact have other causes for their high cholesterol, such as combined hyperlipidemia due to metabolic syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Long-chain <b>triglycerides</b> inhibit {{gastric acid}} secretion, {{but the effect}} of medium-chain <b>triglycerides</b> in humans is unknown. We {{compared}} the effects of intraduodenally perfused saline, medium-chain and long-chain <b>triglycerides</b> on gastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion and cholecystokinin release. Eight healthy male volunteers participated in this study. Gastrin-stimulated gastric acid output was 9. 4 ± 1. 1 mmol/ 30 min during saline perfusion. It was suppressed by medium-chain <b>triglycerides</b> by 43 ± 9 % (P = 0. 04 vs. saline) and by long-chain <b>triglycerides</b> by 74 ± 6 % (P = 0. 0003 vs. saline). Thus medium-chain <b>triglycerides</b> inhibited gastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion but less so than long-chain <b>triglycerides.</b> When compared to saline perfusion (73 ± 6 pM x 30 min) integrated plasma cholecystokinin concentrations were significantly elevated by long-chain <b>triglycerides</b> (96 ± 5 pM x 30 min, P < 0. 004) but not by medium-chain <b>triglycerides</b> perfusion (65 ± 7 pM x 30 min). We also investigated the role of cholecystokinin infusion on gastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion. Higher concentrations (191. 4 ± 4. 5 pM x 30 min) of CCK than released in the long-chain <b>triglycerides</b> perfusion experiment, did not suppress gastric acid secretion.

5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma <b>triglyceride</b> levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are {{primarily}} associated with the elevation of plasma <b>triglyceride</b> levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
5|$|Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma <b>triglyceride</b> levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E

5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and <b>triglyceride</b> levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has been}} able to show the {{function}} of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for <b>triglyceride</b> synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for <b>triglyceride</b> synthesis; and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this synergistic effect with the decrease in <b>triglyceride</b> levels, can indirectly raise HDL cholesterol levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the beta chain of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase HDL cholesterol levels.
