5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} {{abortion}} clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges,</b> and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E

5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence. It became widely known in the United States after comedian Charlie Chaplin parodied it in his 1940 film The Great Dictator. Comedy group The <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> also made fun of it in two of their short subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.|$|E
5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{animated}} series {{also produced}} by Hanna-Barbera, titled The Robonic Stooges, originally {{seen as a}} featured segment on The Skatebirds (CBS, 1977–1978), featuring Moe, Larry, and Curly (voiced by Paul Winchell, Joe Baker and Frank Welker, respectively) as bionic cartoon superheroes with extendable limbs, similar to the later Inspector Gadget. The Robonic Stooges later aired as a separate half-hour series, retitled The <b>Three</b> Robonic <b>Stooges</b> (each half-hour featured two segments of The <b>Three</b> Robonic <b>Stooges</b> and one segment of Woofer & Whimper, Dog Detectives, the latter re-edited from episodes of Clue Club, an earlier Hanna-Barbera cartoon series).|$|R

25|$|The revitalized trio {{starred in}} six feature-length movies: Have Rocket, Will Travel (1959); Snow White and the <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> (1961); The <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> Meet Hercules; The <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> in Orbit (both 1962); The <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> Go Around the World in a Daze (1963); and The Outlaws Is Coming (1965).|$|E
25|$|Howard {{was portrayed}} by Paul Ben-Victor in The <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges,</b> a 2000 made-for-TV biopic {{that focused on}} the trio's years in show {{business}} and their off-screen lives.

25|$|Beginning in 1959, the <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> {{began to}} appear in a series of novelty records. Their first {{recording}} was a 45 rpm single of the title song from Have Rocket, Will Travel. The trio released additional singles and LPs on the Golden and Coral labels, mixing comedy adventure albums and off-beat renditions of children's songs. Their final recording was the 1966 Yogi Bear and the <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> Meet the Mad, Mad, Mad Dr. No-No, which incorporated the <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> into the cast of the Yogi Bear cartoons.|$|E
50|$|The Cotpotros (Kottopotoro) are Gorma grunts {{in black}} tuxedo tights with lipped but {{otherwise}} blank {{black and white}} faces.

In the finale, the Dairanger faced red-dressed Cotpotros in the palace. The group were later summoned by Zaigan during Super Sentai World.|$|R

50|$|The re-edited films {{range from}} clever to blatantly patchy, {{and are often}} {{dismissed}} as second-rate. Rumpus in the Harem borrows from Malice in the Palace, Hot Stuff from Fuelin' Around, and Commotion on the Ocean (all re-edits released 1956) from Dunked in the Deep (originals all 1949). The best-received (and most technically accomplished) is Scheming Schemers (again 1956), combining new footage with recycled clips from <b>three</b> old <b>Stooge</b> shorts: A Plumbing We Will Go (1940), Half-Wits Holiday (1947) and Vagabond Loafers (1949).|$|R

25|$|On February 3, 2016, C3 {{announced}} a new action/adventure film titled The <b>Three</b> Little <b>Stooges.</b> It will star Gordy De StJeor, Liam Dow, and Luke Clark as 12-year-old versions of Moe, Larry, and Curly. The first film, which will set the foundation for future films and television spin-offs, is set to begin production in November 2017, and expected {{to be released in}} Summer 2018. The screenplay was written by Harris Goldberg, with Sean McNamara set to direct. The film's budget is 5.8 million. On July 19, C3 began seeking crowdfunding to pay for a portion of the budget. In August 2017, they exceeded their minimum goal of $50,000.|$|R
2500|$|The Stooges were {{required}} to release up to eight short films per year within a 40-week period; for the remaining 12 or so weeks, they were free to pursue other employment, time that was either spent with their families or touring the country to promote their live act. The Stooges appeared in 190 film shorts and five features while at Columbia, outlasting every one of their contemporaries employed in the short-film genre. Del Lord directed more than <b>three</b> dozen <b>Stooge</b> films, Jules White directed dozens more and his brother Jack White directed several under the pseudonym [...] "Preston Black".

25|$|In the 1940s the <b>Three</b> <b>Stooges</b> became topical, making several anti-Nazi short films, {{including}} You Nazty Spy!

50|$|During the 1950s, rising {{production}} costs forced Columbia to economize, and reuse sequences from older pictures. Jules White called upon Jack White to write new scripts that plausibly incorporated scenes {{from some other}} movie. Jack's biggest challenge was probably the Stooge short Scheming Schemers (released 1956), for which he not only had to insert old scenes from <b>three</b> older <b>Stooge</b> shorts, {{but he had to}} write around the absence of co-star Shemp Howard, who had died in 1955. Jack's creative ideas cleverly hid the patchwork; according to Columbia director Edward Bernds, neither audiences nor exhibitors ever noticed the old footage in the new comedies. White worked at Columbia until the comedy shorts unit closed on December 20, 1957.|$|R

5000|$|By the 1920s, Moe had {{teamed up}} with boyhood-friend-turned-vaudeville star Ted Healy in a [...] "roughhouse" [...] act.

His {{original}} stooges were the Howard brothers, and others came and went during 1925 - 1928, with Larry Fine joining in March 1928. On stage, Healy would sing and tell jokes while his <b>three</b> noisy <b>stooges</b> would get in his way. He would retaliate with physical and verbal abuse. Shemp played a bumbling fireman in the Stooges' first film, Soup to Nuts (1930), the only film in which he plays one of Healy's gang.|$|R
