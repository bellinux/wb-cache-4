5|$|Before {{teaching}} at the Academy, Maeser taught at several different schools in Germany and in Utah. He tutored Brigham Young's children. Maeser incorporated the Monitorial System into his teaching philosophies and believed that students should each have responsibilities. Maeser was influenced by Pestalozzian educational theory, but also advocated <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> should include religion.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{there were}} 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were {{run by the}} Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 {{students}} were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed {{that there was a}} nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology, science labs and extra curricular activities.|$|E

40|$|Today, digital {{technologies}} (DT) {{can be said}} to play {{an important}} role in the Swedish school system. The goal of this essay was to describe DT use by school leaders, in relation to their views on schools’ goals and visions, and teachers’ and students’ use of DTs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five school leaders of secondary schools in Umeå municipality, Sweden. The results show <b>that</b> <b>school</b> leaders’ use of DTs center on three key tasks: communication, information and administration. Further, it is shown <b>that</b> <b>school</b> leaders’ views vary in regards to DTs’ role in school goals, and visions, for digital use. In the discussion/analysis it is argued <b>that</b> <b>school</b> leaders’ views on DTs in schools can be explained as functionalistic, and that this view may inhibit new uses for DTs in schools, and also give a dysfunctional view on the technologies <b>that</b> <b>school</b> leaders do not use. In conclusion it is argued <b>that</b> <b>school</b> leaders might need to reflect more about the DT use of school...|$|R

5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, 2008, a {{government}} working group presented New Brunswick Education Minister Kelly Lamrock with eight recommendations for extracurricular transportation. The recommendations included that guidelines for transporting students to school-related extracurricular activities be strengthened, that {{a school bus}} be used when transporting ten or more students, that vehicles be equipped with snow tires if travelling between October 15 and April 30, and that the district superintendent be charged with responsibility for ensuring safe transportation of students to and from extracurricular activities. Lamrock initially suggested <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> voluntarily follow the recommendations, though they were later made into enforceable policy.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair was {{critical}} of the BBC's decision, accusing it of incompetence and arrogance. Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers, including the BBC Micro and Research Machines 380Z, <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> could purchase, {{with the aid of}} a grant, for half price; Sinclair's computers were not included on the list. Sinclair responded by launching his own half-price deal, offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16 KB RAM pack for £60, plus a ZX Printer at half price, for a total cost of £90. As the cheapest Government-approved system was £130, this was an attractive offer for many schools and about 2,300 bought Sinclair's package.|$|E

Diệm decided the students, not usually known for political activism, {{should be allowed to}} voice their opinions. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which was met with arrests, imprisonment, and the closure of the campus.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the typhoon, the Pacific Air Forces were on standby to deliver supplies to Guam, but were delayed by inoperable airstrips. Guam Memorial Hospital was damaged, but other civilian and military installations, including the Navy's hospital, were able to handle injured persons. On November12, Manuel Guerrero made an urgent appeal to the Government of the United States requesting that aid be rushed to the territory. Additionally, he instituted an island-wide curfew between 8:00p.m. and 6:00a.m. local time to limit looting. At schools, teachers were called in to guard supplies and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, under orders from United States President John F. Kennedy, declared Guam a major disaster area later that day, allowing residents to receive federal aid. Additionally, 15 United States Air Force communications technicians were deployed from Manila, Philippines carrying three plane-loads of communication supplies. Guerrero estimated that it would take four months to complete repairs to utilities. It was also estimated <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> on the island would be closed for six months.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E

On June30, the state's civil defense agency and education secretary announced <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> would be closed throughout the state during the storm. Thirteen shelters were opened in Reynosa, twenty-two in Matamoros, and ten in San Fernando; a total of 3,000 people sought protection from the storm in the three municipalities. Throughout the state, 20,000 people were asked to evacuate to safer areas. Nuevo León schools were also ordered to be closed for at least 24 hours; the Universidad Regiomontana, Universidad de Monterrey and Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León followed suit. In Monterrey, mandatory evacuations alongside the Santa Catarina River were ordered, {{as well as the}} evacuation of 5,000 families in the highlands of the city. Throughout the state, a total of 90 shelters were opened. Coahuila did not close its schools, expecting Alex to reach the state as a tropical depression or weaker, but asked its schools to not take attendance.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E

Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth. It is his belief <b>that</b> <b>schools</b> that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.|$|E
