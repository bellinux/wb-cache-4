25|$|The name of Maodun {{has been}} {{associated}} with Oghuz Khagan, an epic ancestor of the Turkic people. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a striking similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turko manuscripts (Rashid al-Din, Hondemir, Abulgazi) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by N.Ya. Bichurin (Compilation of reports, pp.56–57).|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone but <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a little harder}} to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of time in filming, no tracks were filmed that were unreleased, but several {{alternative}} shots and outtakes were held in the Archives du Film du Bois D'Arcy near Paris. At some point, an employee of the owners, MHF Productions, decided this footage was of no value and incinerated all 548 cans of the original 35mm negatives. Maben was particularly frustrated about the lack of additional shots for [...] "One of These Days," [...] which is primarily a Mason solo-piece in the released version. Mason recalls <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that the reel of film featuring the other members was lost attempting to assemble the original cut.|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons writer Al Jean {{commented that}} Grampa {{is often the}} focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because the staff is trying to {{illustrate}} how society mistreats the elderly, [...] "and {{some of it is}} because people over 55 never watch our show". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are [...] "obsessed" [...] with old people. Weinstein commented that they [...] "both love [...] and seem to really hate them at the same time". He also said that he [...] "enjoys" [...] writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang".|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that this countermeasure has a 1-bit subliminal channel. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{the problem that}} a proof can succeed or purposely fail.|$|E
5000|$|The {{probable}} cause was that [...] "The aircraft did not maintain the adequate height for the circuit {{and continued to}} descend until it contacted <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> abnormal continuation of descent is unknown".|$|R

50|$|The main {{employer}} at Chatsworh is the Zimbabwe Republic Police. Chatsworth has {{an unusually}} large police station for a hamlet that size. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the station serves a very wide sparsely populated rural area.

50|$|In the 2010-2011 season, Vellidis played 4 matches for Aris F.C., {{bringing}} good performances.

5000|$|Cupping has {{not been}} studied in large, {{controlled}} clinical trials. Part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{because it would be}} difficult to have a control group. Placebo effects can be strong, especially in regards to psychological effect of very large visible marks. [...] Research into wet/dry cupping is mostly negative or of poor quality and with high bias.|$|E
5000|$|The {{central theme}} of the {{exhibition}} is [...] "the formation, history {{and development of the}} Eifel maars past and present". As a result, the maars are not just presented in isolation, but in the wider, international context. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the specialist knowledge of many international scientists who take part {{in the development of the}} museum.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fortress}} {{had earlier}} received very poor funding. Since its completion in 1791, Sveaborg received no extra {{financial support from}} the government (<b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> still a mystery, but naturally related to the weak Swedish economic situation). The military equipment was in an unsatisfactory condition. Most of the supplies were of bad quality and the fortress was lacking most supplies.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that, in {{differential}} calculus, the tangent at {{the point}} (x0, y0) of such a curve {{is defined by the}} equationwhose left-hand side is the term of degree one of the Taylor expansion. Thus, if this term is zero, the tangent may not be defined in the standard way, either because it does not exists or a special definition must be provided.|$|E

50|$|In the Reichsbahn's {{provisional}} renumbering plan of 1923, all six locomotives {{were included}} as numbers 98 301 - 98 306; they were however {{taken out of}} service in the same year. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> was <b>the</b> difficulty of accessing the inside driving gear for maintenance work.|$|R
30|$|But {{one should}} also ask: isn’t this preoccupation with {{clear-cut}} definitions and delimitations, after all, a sterile academic exercise? Should we care?

50|$|For each X0 {{the window}} width is constant, {{and the weight}} of each point in the window is schematically denoted by the yellow figure in the graph.

5000|$|This is done {{by first}} noting that a {{sentence}} such as [...] is either refutable (its negation is always true) or satisfiable, i.e. there is some model in which it holds (it might even be always true, i.e. a tautology); this model is simply assigning truth values to the subpropositions from which B is built. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the completeness of propositional logic, with the existential quantifiers playing no role.|$|E

50|$|Neiden was governmentally divided officially in 1852. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> {{separation}} was <b>the</b> remarcation treaty {{between the}} Kingdom of Sweden-Norway and the Grand Duchy of Finland, which prohibited nomadic reindeer herding and moving of fishermen over the border.
