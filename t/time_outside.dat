5|$|David's {{activities}} and whereabouts after 1114 {{are not always}} easy to trace. He spent much of his <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> his principality, in England and in Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{factors such}} as time spent outside and {{distance}} travelled by workers has been correlated to colony size. Workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less <b>time</b> <b>outside,</b> whereas those in larger colonies spend more <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> and at greater distances from their nest. Such results have also {{been seen in the}} western honey bee (Apis mellifera), but, unlike the honey bees, workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads. The decreased foraging time may reduce the risk of predation and save energy; for example, the limited energy in R.aurata is a result of time spent looking for food sources, rather than the collection of food items. The shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic. Group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources. As these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates, the chance of a worker encountering others is improved by marking the ground with trail pheromones. This behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates. Marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items, which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise the encounter rate with nestmates. However, when workers are transporting small to large crickets, marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower the retrieval time for other ants. Workers can quickly readjust their foraging activity in accordance with food quality.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Paris was {{frequently}} amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate {{began at the}} beginning of the 1990s on what to do with it. It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002. That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.|$|E

5|$|The most {{commonly}} suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He {{is known to}} have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem St. Erkenwald, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to Gawain. St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by some scholars to a <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe (née Clemm; August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847) was {{the wife}} of American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The couple were first cousins and {{publicly}} married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 26. Biographers disagree as {{to the nature of}} the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842 she contracted tuberculosis, growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in the family's cottage, at that <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> New York City.|$|E
5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E

5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: {{to increase}} his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.|$|E
5|$|At the ATP finals, Murray beat Djokovic 6–3 6–4, {{claiming}} {{the title and}} the No.1 spot {{at the end of}} the year, and ending 2016 on a 24-match winning streak, the longest of his career. He became the second player after Andre Agassi to win Grand Slam, World Tour Finals, Olympic and Masters titles, and the first to do so in the same calendar year. 2016 marked the first year since 2003 that neither Federer, Nadal or Djokovic finished the year as world number 1. Despite his struggles with form throughout the second half of the year, Djokovic still ended 2016 as world number 2. Having suffered from injury plagued seasons, Nadal and Federer ended the year at number 9 and number 16 respectively. For Nadal it was his lowest end of year ranking since 2004, while Federer's fall in the rankings meant that November 2016 marked his first <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the top 10 since October 2002.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic {{would then}} suffer his own {{thrashing}} {{at the hands}} of Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals of the French Open, when he lost in straight sets, including losing the third set 6-0, his first bagel at a grand slam tournament since 2005. This further emphasised that Djokovic was still very far from his best form. Following this loss, he fell to world No.4, his lowest ranking since October 2009 and his first <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the top two of the rankings since March 2011. In contrast, Nadal breezed through to the French Open final without dropping a set, including a third round match where he only lost one game. Murray, meanwhile, bounced back from his recent poor form by reaching the semi-finals, but lost to Stan Wawrinka in a five-set epic. Nadal then defeated Wawrinka in the final to become the first player in the Open Era to win ten titles at a single slam. This win also ended a three-year drought of slam titles for the Spaniard, his last title coming at the French Open in 2014. Following the win, Nadal returned to world No. 2, his highest ranking since October 2014.|$|E

5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E
5|$|The French media {{reported}} {{little on}} the event as it happened, and relatively little mention of the nationalist struggle was mentioned in Les Temps Modernes, the leftist publication that would become considered the leading anti-colonial advocate after {{the launch of the}} French offensive in Indochina. Other private publications served as forums for the Francophone intelligentsia to express their condemnation of the French government's response to the Uprising. The most commentary appeared in the left-leaning Catholic monthly L'Esprit, with criticisms also published in other leftist publications like Humanité, Combat, Franc-tireur and Témoignage Chrétien. Albert Camus penned a seething rebuke of the French colonial administration that was published on 10 May 1947 in Combat. Very few details of the rising and subsequent repression were reported at the <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> France.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys {{adhered to}} Roman Catholicism. The Diocese of Transylvania {{included}} {{most of the}} province, but the Saxons of Southern Transylvania were subjected to the archbishops of Esztergom. Catholic commoners were to pay an ecclesiastic tax, the tithe, but John XXIII exempted the lesser noblemen from paying it in 1415. However, George Lépes, the bishop of Transylvania, ignored this decision, especially after John had been declared an antipope. They were originally exempt from the ecclesiastic tax, but Sigismund of Luxemburg, king of Hungary, decreed that the Vlachs who settled on lands abandoned by Catholic peasants were to also pay the tithe. Sigismund was an absent monarch, deeply involved in European politics; he spent much <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> Hungary, especially in his other realms, such as Germany and Bohemia.|$|E

5|$|The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four's {{collective}} grip on {{the major}} titles slip still further, however, as Kei Nishikori and Marin Čilić beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi-finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open, {{and the first time}} since 2003 that multiple first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season. Following the tournament, Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings, his first <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the top 10 since 2008. The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four's dominance. Towards the end of the year, Andy Murray managed to return to form, winning three titles in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia, allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals, but he bowed out at the group stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer, in which he won just a single game. Indeed, throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings.|$|E
5|$|Then, in the Madrid Open, Murray {{defeated}} Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori {{to reach}} the final, where he defeated Nadal in straight sets to win his first Masters title on clay and first since 2013. This {{was also the first}} time he had beaten another member of the Big Four in a Tour match since his victory in the final at Wimbledon 2013, going into the match 0–12 against the other members. The defeat saw Nadal slip to seventh in the rankings, his first <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> the Top 5 for more than a decade. Djokovic, returning after skipping Madrid, again defeated Federer in the final for his fourth Masters title of the year in Rome. Nadal suffered his worst European clay-court season in a decade, failing to win a single title and appearing in just one final, whereas Djokovic and Murray entered the second Grand Slam event of the year unbeaten on clay.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Nomura {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} if Square Enix would release an international Final Mix of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, to which he replied he would like to, as he enjoyed the work from the English voice casting done in the previous games. However, he stated {{that one of the}} main reasons for the popularity of the Final Mix version of Kingdom Hearts II was because it was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, so he and the staff would think on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011. Final Mix was released for the first <b>time</b> <b>outside</b> Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix.|$|E
