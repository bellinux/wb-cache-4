Concerned for officer and public safety, Safir expanded firearms training and introduced Firearms <b>Training</b> <b>Simulators.</b> Under his leadership, firearms discharge incidents decreased from 344 in 1995 to 155 in 1999. He developed and implemented Operation Condor, a creative use of personnel resources, that continues to be a centerpiece of current NYPD crime reduction strategy.

The deal includes an initial support contract for maintenance of the new helicopters, along with spare parts and <b>training</b> <b>simulators</b> for UK pilots. The first UK helicopters are due off the US production line in early 2020 and will begin entering service with the British Army in 2022. [...] "To further guarantee value for money, systems from the current Apache fleet, such as the Modernised Target Acquisition & Designation System, and the Longbow Fire Control Radar, will be reused and incorporated into the new helicopters where possible." [...] Approval for the re-manufacture of fifty of the UK's WAH-64 Mk 1 fleet to AH-64E Apache Guardian standard had been given by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in August 2015. The aircraft will utilise the General Electric T700 engine rather than the Turbomeca RTM322 from the current fleet; the first off-the-shelf purchase of a GE engine by the UK MOD.|$|E
