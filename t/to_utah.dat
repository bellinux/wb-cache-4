5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route the {{railroad}} {{south of the}} canyon and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City and {{for a brief period}} the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used the canyon as a path <b>to</b> <b>Utah</b> and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Franklin D. Richards, {{returning}} from Europe {{where he had}} served as the Church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies.

5|$|The {{handcart}} companies {{continued with}} more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued {{for those who}} could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return <b>to</b> <b>Utah</b> in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with {{the completion of the}} Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, future emigrants were able to travel by rail, and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end.|$|E

After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed <b>to</b> <b>Utah</b> beach.|$|E

However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary. After legal negotiation, half of a box of the collection {{was given to the}} LDS Church Archives.|$|E
5|$|Before 1926, all {{of modern}} US491 existed as state routes. In New Mexico, US666 absorbed {{a portion of}} State Road 32 (NM32) from Gallup to Shiprock, and {{completely}} replaced NM121 from Shiprock to the Colorado state line. The portion in Colorado was numbered State Highway108 (SH108) from the New Mexico state line to Cortez, and SH10 from Cortez <b>to</b> <b>Utah.</b> At the time, SH10 traversed the southern portion of Colorado. While most of this route was absorbed by the U.S. Highway System, a portion of it still exists. In Utah, the route was originally numbered State Route 9 (SR9), which also included what is now US191 from Monticello to Crescent Junction. Utah has since re-used the SR9 designation for a different road.|$|E

5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate <b>to</b> <b>Utah,</b> often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the {{handcart}} emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way <b>to</b> <b>Utah</b> to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E
5|$|Following Houston's loss <b>to</b> <b>Utah,</b> McGrady {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} on both {{his left shoulder}} and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} year. By then, his averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.|$|E

Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body.

5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating <b>to</b> <b>Utah</b> or Alberta as many members had done before, to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E
