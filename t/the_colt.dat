5|$|On May 20, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Zayat had sold breeding rights to <b>the</b> <b>colt</b> to the Ashford Stud, {{a division of}} Ireland's Coolmore Stud, but retained control over <b>the</b> <b>colt</b> and his racing career. Before the announcement, offers for American Pharoah's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $20 million. After the Belmont, Forbes magazine {{reported that}} Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, long before he began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $100,000 stud fee, he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The New York Times said that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|E

5|$|Paradox was a strongly-built {{bay horse}} bred by the Graham {{brothers}} at the Yardley Stud near Birmingham. He was sired by the 2,000 Guineas runner-up Sterling out of Casuistry, an undistinguished racehorse {{who had been}} sold cheaply {{at the end of}} her racing career by Lord Rosebery. Casuistry became an important broodmare, being the direct female ancestor of notable thoroughbreds such as Humorist, Royal Palace and Spend a Buck.

5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} North and the South with firearms. He {{had been known}} to sell weapons to warring parties {{on both sides of}} other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect to the war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with <b>the</b> <b>Colt</b> revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E
50|$|Following {{their first}} win of <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Colts</b> faced another divisional rival in the Tennessee Titans. After {{being forced to}} punt on their first {{offensive}} drive, <b>the</b> <b>Colts</b> defense forced a fumble that was recovered by Ricky Jean-Francois and set up <b>the</b> <b>Colts</b> inside Titan territory. After a 37-yard pass from quarterback Andrew Luck to T. Y. Hilton set <b>the</b> <b>Colts</b> up at <b>the</b> one yard line, Trent Richardson scored on the next play, putting <b>the</b> <b>Colts</b> up 7-0. An onside kick gave the ball back to <b>the</b> <b>Colts,</b> which led to an eleven play, 44-yard drive that ended in a touchdown pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. <b>The</b> <b>Colts</b> defense again forced a turnover on the Titans next possession, with Charlie Whitehurst throwing an interception to Mike Adams. Luck and <b>the</b> <b>Colts</b> offense again drove down the field, though this time having {{to settle for a}} field goal, extending the lead to 17-0. Tennessee scored their first points midway through the second quarter on a Ryan Succop. <b>The</b> <b>Colts</b> responded on their next possession with a 30-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri.

On the first play of the Ravens offensive possession, Steve Smith fumbled the ball, which was then recovered by Montori Hughes of <b>the</b> <b>Colts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Colts</b> settled for a 38-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri, giving then an early 3-0 lead. A muffed punt return by Jacoby Jones resulted in a second Ravens turnover, however, on <b>the</b> ensuing <b>Colts</b> drive, Haloti Ngata intercepted Luck, their first turnover of the game.

5|$|Since {{breeding}} Scamper was not {{an option}} for genetic inheritability, James spent several years researching the possibility of cloning. She chose ViaGen, an animal genetics corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of <b>the</b> <b>colt</b> and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000. Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom have inherited Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration is not required to compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events.|$|E
5|$|This {{leads the}} {{brothers}} to the riverside Sunrise Apartments in Jefferson City, Missouri. The boys manage to overpower the demons guarding John, and rescue him.

5|$|While {{generally}} {{successful with}} his race horses, Zayat's goal {{of winning the}} Kentucky Derby eluded him several times, including three second-place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting {{large sums of money}} on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned <b>the</b> <b>colt</b> the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
