If {{in the first}} step, the right foot is taken forward, then in the next step it is the left one. After each step, they flex the knees.

When <b>they</b> have <b>danced</b> forward for some distance, <b>they</b> <b>dance</b> backward with the same movement. Thus <b>they</b> <b>dance</b> moving forward and backward.|$|R

25|$|Another story {{surrounding}} the Fling {{claims that it}} is meant to imitate a stag; the story goes that a boy who saw a stag was asked to describe it by his father.

500|$|Prior to {{the nineteenth}} century, the term would have simply meant country song, with no {{particular}} form implied—a meaning it retains in {{the vocabulary of}} early music. According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a [...] "choral dance song" [...] wherein a vocal soloist—frequently female—semi-improvised the [...] "unique" [...] lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers—all female, or male and female mixed—chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as <b>they</b> <b>danced</b> around her in a circle." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the nineteenth}} century, {{immigrants}} flooded into Peninsular Malaysia, colonising the Straits Settlements including the island city of Singapore. Migrants and natives held differing beliefs, but over time the boundaries between those belief systems blurred. Most of the population believed in spirits that inhabit the jungles, and in gods and devils that hover around, capable of benevolence and mischief. [...] Certain people claimed that they could communicate with these supernatural beings. [...] Through rituals in which <b>they</b> <b>danced</b> and chanted, these spirit mediumstang-kees and bomohsinvited the beings to possess their bodies and dole out wisdoms, blessings, and curses to their believers. [...] As time passed and the cities grew, the jungles gave way to concrete structures and the mediums' practices moved deeper into the heartland of communities.|$|E

Oseary confirmed through Twitter that Mert and Marcus were enlisted as the video directors. The singer also recruited Ukrainian dance group Kazaky to appear with her in the video.

According to Mark Johansen from International Business Times, the group achieved popularity in 2010 for their [...] "techno beats, tiny outfits, sky-high stilettos" [...] and [...] "highly stylized videos".

During the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from American Life, [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". But [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] were later dropped from the show. Hence [...] "Material Girl" [...] was transferred as the closing song of the military segment of the show, and was re-arranged as an electric guitar version. Madonna wore military themed clothes and sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone and playing an electric guitar.

500|$|An {{important}} {{deviation of}} the film's plot from history {{is that there}} is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that <b>they</b> <b>danced</b> at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was [...] "too proud" [...] to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a [...] "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that {{he was in love with}} her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life, opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [...] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was [...] "her greatest inspiration" [...] as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.|$|E
