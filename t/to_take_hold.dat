Wigan Borough, founded in 1919, became the town's first club to play in the Football League when in 1921 they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North. The club left the Football League and folded in 1931. They were replaced a year later by Wigan Athletic, the town's current professional football club.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{potential}} local ownership group was identified in late February, local {{opposition to a}} perceived bailout of multi-millionaire ownership began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold.</b> A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice their opposition to a public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 {{percent of those polled}} being against intervention. However support for intervention on the arena issue began to take shape as well with several at the local and state level stating their intention to make a deal happen. Additionally, businesses near the arena starting a campaign to keep the team in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Islam is also practiced on the island. Islam {{was first}} brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who {{established}} several Islamic schools {{along the eastern}} coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> in {{all but a handful}} of southeastern coastal communities. Today, Muslims constitute 7–3percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E

5|$|The ideas {{advocated}} by several influential reformers {{in the early}} 1900s, such as Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri, began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> at al-Azhar in 1928, with the appointment of Mustafa al-Maraghi as rector. A follower of Abduh, {{the majority of the}} ulema opposed his appointment. Al-Maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of the mosque and its school, expanding programs outside of the traditional subjects. Fuad disliked al-Maraghi, and had him replaced after one year by al-Zawahiri, but al-Maraghi would return to the post of rector in 1935, serving until his death in 1945. Under his leadership, al-Azhar's curriculum was expanded to include non-Arabic languages and modern sciences. Al-Zawahiri, who had also been opposed by the ulema of the early 1900s, continued the efforts to modernize and reform al-Azhar. Following al-Maraghi's second term as rector, another student of Abduh was appointed rector.|$|E

The plan involved poisoning other trout species in the upper Smith River drainage, and then introducing cutthroat in two locations a year later.

25|$|After the Mexican War of Independence, the crafts’ guilds {{that had}} {{regulated}} manufacture through {{the colonial period}} were abolished. Since anyone could call themself a craftsman, product quality deteriorated badly, especially in pottery, foreign products entered the country freely and industrialization began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold.</b> To help stop the socio-economic deterioration of artisans, brotherhoods, cooperatives and professional organizations were founded. However, indigenous artists generally did not join these associations, and they remained within their own socioeconomic organizations.|$|E

25|$|Damaged {{valves and}} endocardium {{contribute}} to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis.|$|E
