When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala <b>there</b> <b>goes</b> mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E

25|$|Nyong'o {{grew up in}} {{an artistic}} family, where get-togethers often {{included}} performances by the children, and trips to see plays. She attended Rusinga International school in Kenya and acted in school plays. At age 14, Nyong'o made her professional acting debut as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet in a production by the Nairobi-based repertory company Phoenix Players. While a member of the Phoenix Players, Nyong'o also performed in the plays On The Razzle and <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> The Bride. Nyong'o cites the performances of American actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey in The Color Purple with inspiring her to pursue a professional acting career.|$|E
25|$|After the Eagles broke up, {{the former}} members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, owned {{the rights to}} solo albums created {{by members of the}} Eagles (though several of them moved to {{different}} labels in ensuing years). Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, before and during his time with the Eagles, but it was uncharted waters for the others. Walsh released a successful album in 1981, <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> the Neighborhood, but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s, such as Got Any Gum? were less well received. During this period Walsh performed as a session musician for Dan Fogelberg, Steve Winwood, John Entwistle, Richard Marx and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, among others, and produced and co-wrote Ringo Starr's Old Wave album.|$|E
25|$|Born in London, Niven {{attended}} Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe before {{gaining a}} place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. Having developed an interest in acting, he left the army, travelled to Hollywood and had several minor roles in film. He first appeared as an extra in the British film <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> the Bride (1932). From there, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films from 1933 to 1935, including a non-speaking role in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Mutiny on the Bounty. This brought him to wider attention within the film industry and he was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant.|$|E

25|$|Manitoba Hydro has {{transmission}} lines connecting with Saskatchewan, Ontario, North Dakota and Minnesota. Ties to the Canadian provinces are of low capacity but {{a substantial portion}} of Manitoba Hydro's annual generation can be exported over the tie to Minnesota. In 2003, a new line was completed to the United States (the Harvey-Glenboro 230kV line), allowing a firm export capacity of 700 megawatts. In 2005 Manitoba Hydro announced increased interchange up to 500 MW with Ontario, after construction of additional transmission facilities. Manitoba Hydro's largest interconnection is the Dorsey-Forbes-Chisago 500,000 volt (AC) line that begins at the Dorsey substation located in Rosser near Winnipeg and travels south into the United States and takes a southeasterly direction to the Forbes Substation northwest of Duluth, Minnesota and from <b>there</b> <b>goes</b> south to the Chisago substation located just north of St. Paul, Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|Time has passed, and {{a heavily}} {{pregnant}} Dot visits George's studio. She {{asks for a}} painting George made of her, but he refuses. Jules and Yvonne come to the studio to see George's nearly finished painting. While Jules goes with George to see the painting, Yvonne and Dot hold a wary conversation. They realize they have both felt neglected by an artist, their mutual dislike fades, and they discuss the difficulties of trying to maintain a romantic relationship with an artist. Meanwhile, Jules is puzzled by George's new technique and concerned that his obsession with his work is alienating him from his fellow artists and collectors alike. He refuses to support the work. Jules and Yvonne leave, and George, having forgotten Dot was <b>there,</b> <b>goes</b> back to work. Dot reveals {{the real reason for}} her visit: despite the obvious fact that George fathered her unborn child, she and Louis are getting married and leaving for America. George angrily retreats behind his canvas, and she begs him to react, in some way, to her news. They argue bitterly about their failed relationship, and Dot concludes sadly that while George may be capable of self-fulfillment, she is not, and they must part ("We Do Not Belong Together").|$|E

500|$|The school's {{teams are}} called [...] "Hoyas", a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, {{students}} {{well versed in}} classical languages invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of [...] "Hoya Saxa", translating roughly as [...] "what (or such) rocks." [...] The school's baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers {{to one of these}} teams. By the 1920s, the term [...] "Hoyas" [...] was used to describe groups on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead of the older team name, the [...] "Hilltoppers." [...] The name was picked up in the local publications, and became official shortly after. Jack the Bulldog has been the mascot of Georgetown athletics programs since 1962, and the school fight song is <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> Old Georgetown.|$|E
500|$|Santiago {{describes}} his guitar playing as [...] "angular and bent," [...] "all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up". Notable in his style {{is how he}} uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> My Gun. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles' [...] "Savoy Truffle", where [...] "George Harrison played that bent note that I {{fell in love with}} and later milked it for all it was worth." [...] He used such techniques with the Pixies: Doolittle's [...] "Dead" [...] begins with Santiago's guitar [...] "squawking" [...] on an E-flat like [...] "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.|$|E

Some reviews noted that the recordings were the best representation of Zappa's orchestral work so far. In 1984 Zappa teamed again with Nagano and the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra for a live performance of A Zappa Affair with augmented orchestra, life-size puppets, and moving stage sets. Although critically acclaimed the work was a financial failure, and only performed twice. Zappa was invited by conference organizer Thomas Wells to be the keynote speaker at the American Society of University Composers at the Ohio State University. It was there Zappa delivered his famous [...] "Bingo! <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> Your Tenure" [...] address, and had two of his orchestra pieces, [...] "Dupree's Paradise" [...] and [...] "Naval Aviation in Art?"

500|$|After brief spells as an army officer, whisky {{salesman}} {{and with}} a horse racing syndicate, he was an uncredited extra in his screen debut in <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> the Bride; {{he went on to}} appear in nearly a hundred films, the last of which was in 1983: Curse of the Pink Panther. During his long film career, he was presented with a Golden Globe Award for his part in The Moon Is Blue (1953) and was nominated for a BAFTA for the titular lead in Carrington V.C. (1955). For his role as Major Pollock in the 1958 film Separate Tables, Niven was awarded the Academy and Golden Globe awards for a performance where [...] "the pain behind the fake polish was moving to observe". According to Sheridan Morley, Niven's other notable works include The Charge of the Light Brigade (1938), The Way Ahead (1944), A Matter of Life and Death (1946)—judged by the BFI {{to be one of the}} top twenty British films of all time—The Guns of Navarone (1961) and the role of Sir Charles Litton in three Pink Panther films.|$|E
