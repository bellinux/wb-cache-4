In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products.

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers.

Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocol,</b> the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocol,</b> {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E

25|$|By 1987, in {{response}} to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica, diplomats in Montreal forged a treaty, <b>the</b> <b>Montreal</b> <b>Protocol,</b> which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs.

25|$|CFEES {{also plays}} {{an active role}} in formulating the {{phase-out}} strategy for halon and other ozone layer threatening gases. The National Halon Management Programme, funded under bilateral programme, is implemented by CFEES, supported by Ozone Cell, India.

Overview of the problems of the current system is made, using the KAL flight 007 case. This thesis explores the relationship between passengers and air carriers, which should be interpreted as a common interest. It also examines the term "unlimited" which, frequently, leads to confusion. Even though the purpose of "willful misconduct" is to provide higher compensation for the passenger, it would be better to interpret it as "no-limit" so as not to confuse it with unlimited liability (full-compensation).
