5|$|Considering <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that positrons were {{electrons}} {{that were}} traveling backwards in time, {{he came up}} in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|In very {{elementary}} terms, anti-de Sitter {{space is}} {{a mathematical model}} of spacetime in which <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of distance between points (the metric) is different from <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It {{is closely related to}} hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk as illustrated on the right. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E

Justice itself relies heavily upon <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E

5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

40|$|A {{central issue}} in {{contemporary}} psychology consists in understanding how we develop new cognitive structures {{and how we}} modify them. This article aims to address the links between <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> from conceptual change and some aspects from the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky. For that purpose, <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> of implicit theory and scientific concept were analyzed from the theory of conceptual change, and <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> of error and pseudo-concept from the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky. First, we examined the work of representative authors of conceptual change to understand the place granted to <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> of implicit theory and scientific concept. Then, some aspects from the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky were considered {{to reflect on the}} place that <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> of error and pseudo-concept have in those theories.
