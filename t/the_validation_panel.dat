40|$|Background & Aims: Prognostic {{biomarkers}} {{are lacking}} in primary sclerosing cholangitis, hampering patient {{care and the}} development of therapy. We aimed to identify novel protein biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Methods: Using a bead-based array targeting 63 proteins, we profiled a derivation panel of Norwegian endoscopic retrograde cholangiography bile samples (55 PSC, 20 disease controls) and a Finnish validation panel (34 PSC, 10 disease controls). Selected identified proteins were measured in serum from two Norwegian PSC cohorts (n = 167 [1992 - 2006] and n = 138 [2008 - 2012]), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 96) and healthy controls (n = 100). Results: In the bile derivation panel, the levels of 14 proteins were different between PSC patients and controls (p < 0. 05); all were confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panel.</b> Twenty-four proteins in the bile derivation panel were significantly (p < 0. 05) different between PSC patients with mild compared to severe cholangiographic changes (modified Amsterdam criteria); this was replicated for 18 proteins in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panel.</b> Interleukin (IL) - 8, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) 9 /lipocalin (LCN) 2 -complex, S 100 A 8 / 9, S 100 A 12 and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 2 in the bile were associated with both a PSC diagnosis and grade of cholangiographic changes. Stratifying PSC patients according to tertiles of serum IL- 8, but not MMP 9 /LCN 2 and S 100 A 12, provided excellent discrimination for transplant-free survival both in the serum derivation and validation cohort. Furthermore, IL- 8 was associated with transplant-free survival in multivariable analyses in both serum panels independently of age and disease duration, indicating an independent influence on PSC progression. However, the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF (R)) test and Mayo risk score proved to be stronger predictors of transplant-free survival. Conclusions: Based on assaying of biliary proteins, we have identified novel biliary and serum biomarkers as indicators of severity and prognosis in PSC. Lay summary: Prognostic biomarkers are lacking in primary sclerosing cholangitis, hampering patient care {{and the development of}} therapy. We have identified inflammatory proteins including calprotectin and IL- 8 as important indicators of disease severity and prognosis in bile and serum from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a Salmonella genoserotyping array (SGSA) which rapidly generates an antigenic formula consistent with the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme, currently {{the gold standard for}} Salmonella serotyping. A set of 287 strains representative of 133 Salmonella serovars was assembled to validate the array and to test the array probes for accuracy, specificity, and reproducibility. Initially, 76 known serovars were utilized to validate the specificity and repeatability of the array probes and their expected probe patterns. The SGSA generated the correct serovar designations for 100 % of the known subspecies I serovars tested in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panel</b> and an antigenic formula consistent with that of the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme for 97 % of all known serovars tested. Once validated, the SGSA was assessed against a blind panel of 100 Salmonella enterica subsp. I samples serotyped using traditional methods. In summary, the SGSA correctly identified all of the blind samples as representing Salmonella and successfully identified 92 % of the antigens found within the unknown samples. Antigen- and serovar-specific probes, in combination with a pepT PCR for confirmation of S. enterica subsp. Enteritidis determinations, generated an antigenic formula and/or a serovar designation consistent with the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme for 87 % of unknown samples tested with the SGSA. Future experiments are planned to test the specificity of the array probes with other Salmonella serovars to demonstrate the versatility and utility of this array as a public health tool in the identification of Salmonella...|$|E

The objective, as described by the model, is to train individuals within the refugee community so that they, having information about health, can assist peers to seek and maintain better health in their homes, with their families and in their community. The model includes content, complete with measurable objectives and varied learning opportunities, most of which would not require literacy skills. Topics include the development of a health promoter program, self-care, and specifics such as public and environmental health, child care, first aid, dental care, sexual health, and family planning. Suggested resources are provided to assist the implementer. The educational model was sent to sixteen persons involved in the fields of health science, refugee health, or health education. Each was sent a cover letter requesting their validation responses to the model. Eight individuals (50 %) responded with a 75 percent rate of positive responses. Recommendations by <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panel</b> were considered, and appropriate changes made or considered for future addition. Involvement of the experts provided some vehicle for dissemination of the model. Additional international exposure is planned. The author is encouraging implementation of the health promotion concept, as presented in the educational model, with the appropriate situational modifications.

40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} C-reactive protein (CRP, {{determined}} by a high-sensitivity assay) indicate low-grade inflammation which is implicated in many age-related disorders. Epigenetic studies on CRP might discover molecular mechanisms underlying CRP regulation. We aimed to identify DNA methylation sites related to CRP concentrations in cells and tissues regulating low-grade inflammation. Genome-wide DNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood in 1, 741 participants of the KORA F 4 study using Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip arrays. Four CpG sites (located at BCL 3, AQP 3, SOCS 3, and cg 19821297 intergenic at chromosome 19 p 13. 2, P ≤ 1. 01 E- 07) were significantly hypomethylated at high CRP concentrations independent of various confounders including age, sex, BMI, smoking, and white blood cell composition. Findings were not sex-specific. CRP-related top genes were enriched in JAK/STAT pathways (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P < 0. 05). Results were followed-up in three studies using DNA from peripheral blood (EPICOR, n = 503) and adipose tissue (TwinsUK, n = 368) measured as described above and from liver tissue (LMU liver cohort, n = 286) measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using EpiTYPER. CpG sites at the AQP 3 locus (significant p-values in peripheral blood = 1. 72 E- 03 and liver tissue = 1. 51 E- 03) and the SOCS 3 locus (p-values in liver < 2. 82 E- 05) were associated with CRP in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panels.</b> Epigenetic modifications seem to engage in low-grade inflammation, possibly via JAK/STAT mediated pathways.

40|$|A multitarget {{real-time}} PCR (MRT-PCR) for {{detection of}} Chlamydia trachomatis DNA {{was developed and}} validated. There were three targets for amplification in a single reaction: the cryptic plasmid (CP), the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene, and an internal control. The assay had the following characteristics: (i) detection and confirmation {{of the presence of}} C. trachomatis DNA in a single reaction, (ii) detection of all genovars of C. trachomatis without any cross-reactivity with pathogenic bacteria or commensal organisms of the oropharynx and genital tract, (iii) a 95 % probability of detection with three copies of MOMP and one copy of CP per reaction mixture, (iv) identification of the inhibition of amplification, (v) a quantitative dynamic range of 25 to 250, 000 genome copies per reaction mixture, (vi) high intra- and interassay reproducibilities, and (vii) correct identification of all samples in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panel.</b> There were 146 COBAS Amplicor PCR (Amplicor PCR) -positive samples and 122 Amplicor PCR-negative samples in the panel. MRT-PCR detected CP DNA alone in 6 (4 %) Amplicor PCR-positive samples and both CP and MOMP DNAs in 140 (96 %) of 146 Amplicor PCR-positive samples. The quantity of MOMP DNA in 95 (68 %) of 140 samples was within the dynamic range of the assay. The median C. trachomatis load in these samples was 321 genome copies per reaction mixture (range, 26 to 40, 137 genome copies per reaction mixture). Due to the inclusion of two different C. trachomatis-specific targets, the assay confirmed 259 (97 %) of 268 results in a single reaction. This assay could be used in the qualitative format for the routine detection of C. trachomatis and in the quantitative format for study of the pathogenesis of C. trachomatis-associated diseases. The assay demonstrated the potential to eliminate the need for confirmatory testing in almost all samples, thus reducing the turnaround time and the workload...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{determine}} biomarkers reflecting disease activity and prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We evaluated the prognostic utility of the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score in Norwegian PSC patients. Serum samples were available from 305 well-characterized large-duct PSC patients, 96 ulcerative colitis patients, and 100 healthy controls. The PSC patients constituted a derivation panel (recruited 1992 - 2006 [n[*]=[*] 167]; median age 41 years, 74 % male) and a validation panel (recruited 2008 - 2012 [n[*]=[*] 138]; median age 40 years, 78 % male). We used commercial kits to analyze serum levels of hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1, and propeptide of type III procollagen and calculated ELF scores by the previously published algorithm. Results were also validated by analysis of ELF tests using the ADVIA Centaur XP system and its commercially available reagents. We found that PSC patients stratified by ELF score tertiles exhibited significantly different transplant-free survival in both panels (P[*] <[*] 0. 001), with higher scores associated with shorter survival, which was confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>panel</b> stratified by ELF test tertiles (P[*]=[*] 0. 003). The ELF test distinguished between mild and severe disease defined by clinical outcome (transplantation or death) with an area under the curve of 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 73 - 0. 87) and optimal cutoff of 10. 6 (sensitivity 70. 2 %, specificity 79. 1 %). In multivariate Cox regression analysis in both panels, ELF score (hazard ratio[*]=[*] 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 5, and 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 1, respectively) was associated with transplant-free survival independently of the Mayo risk score (hazard ratio[*]=[*] 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 1. 6, and 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 1, respectively).

40|$|Background Chronic {{diseases}} {{may influence}} patients taking major life changing decisions (MLCDs) concerning for example education, career, relationships, having children and retirement. A validated measure {{is needed to}} evaluate the impact of chronic diseases on MLCDs, improving assessment of their life-long burden. The aims {{of this study were}} to develop a validated questionnaire, the “Major Life Changing Decision Profile” (MLCDP) and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Methods 50 interviews with dermatology patients and 258 questionnaires, completed by cardiology, rheumatology, nephrology, diabetes and respiratory disorder patients, were analysed for qualitative data using Nvivo 8 software. Content validation was carried out by a panel of experts. The first version of the MLCDP was completed by 210 patients and an iterative process of multiple Exploratory Factor Analyses and item prevalence was used to guide item reduction. Face validity and practicability was assessed by patients. Results 48 MLCDs were selected from analysis of the transcripts and questionnaires for the first version of the MLCDP, and reduced to 45 by combination of similar themes. There was a high intraclass correlation coefficient (0. 7) between the 13 members of <b>the</b> content <b>validation</b> <b>panel.</b> Four more items were deleted leaving a 41 -item MLCDP that was completed by 210 patients. The most frequently recorded MLCDs were decisions to change eating habits (71. 4 %), to change smoking/drinking alcohol habits (58. 5 %) and not to travel or go for holidays abroad (50. 9 %). Factor analysis suggested item number reduction from 41 to 34, to 29, then 23 items. However after taking into account item prevalence data as well as factor analysis results, 32 items were retained. The 32 -item MLCDP has five domains education (3 items), job/career (9), family/relationships (5), social (10) and physical (5). The MLCDP score is expressed as the absolute number of decisions that have been affected. Conclusions The 32 -item (5 domains) MLCDP has been developed as an easy to complete generic tool for use in clinical practice and for quality of life and epidemiological research.

40|$|Genotype {{imputation}} {{has become}} a standard practice in modern genetic research to increase genome coverage and improve the accuracy of genomic selection (GS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We assessed accuracies of imputing 60 K genotype data from lower density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels using a small set {{of the most common}} sires in a population of 2140 white layer chickens. Several factors affecting imputation accuracy were investigated, including the size of the reference population, the level of the relationship between <b>the</b> reference and <b>validation</b> populations, and minor allele frequency (MAF) of the SNP being imputed. Results The accuracy of imputation was assessed with different scenarios using 22 and 62 carefully selected reference animals (Ref 22 and Ref 62). Animal-specific imputation accuracy corrected for gene content was moderate on average (~ 0. 80) in most scenarios and low in the 3 K to 60 K scenario. Maximum average accuracies were 0. 90 and 0. 93 for the most favourable scenario for Ref 22 and Ref 62 respectively, when SNPs were masked independent of their MAF. SNPs with low MAF were more difficult to impute, and the larger reference population considerably improved the imputation accuracy for these rare SNPs. When Ref 22 was used for imputation, the average imputation accuracy decreased by 0. 04 when validation population was two instead of one generation away from the reference and increased again by 0. 05 when validation was three generations away. Selecting the reference animals from the most common sires, compared with random animals from the population, considerably improved imputation accuracy for low MAF SNPs, but gave only limited improvement for other MAF classes. The allelic R 2 measure from Beagle software was found to be a good predictor of imputation reliability (correlation¿~¿ 0. 8) when <b>the</b> density of <b>validation</b> <b>panel</b> was very low (3 K) and the MAF of the SNP {{and the size of the}} reference population were not extremely small. Conclusions Even with a very small number of animals in the reference population, reasonable accuracy of imputation can be achieved. Selecting a set of the most common sires, rather than selecting random animals for the reference population, improves the imputation accuracy of rare alleles, which may be a benefit when imputing with whole genome re-sequencing data...|$|R

30|$|The {{challenge}} of passing <b>the</b> <b>validation.</b> Programs often validate the inputs before parsing and handling. <b>The</b> <b>validation</b> {{works as a}} guard of programs, saving the computing resource and protecting the program against invalid inputs and damage caused by malicious constructed inputs. Invalid testcases are always ignored or discarded. Magic numbers, magic strings, version number check, and checksums are common validations used in programs. Testcases generated by black box and gray box fuzzers are hard to pass <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> for a blind generation strategy, which results in quite low efficient fuzzing. Thus, how to pass <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> is another key challenge.|$|R
