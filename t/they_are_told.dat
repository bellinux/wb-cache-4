Meanwhile, several drug dealers receive anonymous phone calls about {{the whereabouts of}} their competitors; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that {{they are at the}} same diner.

40|$|Sixty {{preschool}} children {{were asked to}} perform either an objectively easy task which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> easy for other children, an objectively easy task which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> difficult for others, an objectively difficult task which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> easy for others, or an objectively difficult task which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> difficult. Their level {{of success and failure}} in achievement activity prior to performing this task was manipulated. Results indicated that when the task was either objectively difficult or allegedly difficult for other children, subjects who had failed on a previous task persevered longer than did subjects who had previously succeeded. However, when the task was both objectively easy and apparently easy for others, subjects who had previously been successful persevered longer than subjects who had previously failed. Results were inconsistent with achievement motivation theory (Atkinson, 1957), but were interpretable using an exchange formulation of behavior (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959). © 1967...|$|R

To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight.

They set out in three ships but when they land in Ireland, forty days before the Flood, two of the ships are lost. The only survivors are Cessair, forty-nine other women, and three men: Fintan mac Bóchra, Bith and Ladra. The women are split evenly among the men. Each also takes one as his wife: Fintán takes Cessair, Bith takes Barrfhind and Ladra takes Alba. However, Bith and Ladra soon die and Ladra is the first man buried in Ireland. When the Flood comes, Fintán is the only one to survive. He becomes a salmon and later an eagle and a hawk, living for 5,500 years after the Flood, whence he becomes a man again and recounts Ireland's history.|$|E

After being rejected again, Kehama attains the Amreeta and becomes immortal. However, the Amreeta gives Kehama an immortality of torment, which reflects Kehama's soul. Shiva comes down and restores Yamen to power. Shiva allows Kailyal to drink the Amreeta, which allows her to become a divine being that can be with Ereenia.

With the help of the Tree of Life at Casyapa's mountain, she is able to be healed. However, Kailyal is sent back because Casyapa is worried about Kehama's power. Kailyal is sent to the land of Indra for safety. While there, she is united with her father and Ladurlad, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> of how Vishnu saved humanity by assuming a human form.

500|$|Forensic {{psychologist}} Eric Cullen {{and prison}} governor Tim Newell claim that prisoners face a throffer once <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> {{that they must}} acknowledge their guilt before they are offered parole or moved to an open prison. Cullen and Newell cite {{the example of a}} prisoner who falsely admitted guilt to move to an open prison; once there, however, he felt he could no longer lie about his guilt, and confessed to the prison's governor. He was subsequently transferred back to a maximum security prison. In the case of sex offenders, a throffer is presented when they are offered release if they take up treatment, but are threatened with extended sentences if they do not. Cullen and Newell are concerned about the predicament that these throffers present to prisoners, including those found innocent on appeal. Concerns surrounding throffers proposed to convicted sex offenders have also been discussed in print by Alex Alexandrowicz, himself wrongly imprisoned, and criminologist David Wilson. The latter observed the difficulties for those innocent people wrongly imprisoned who are faced with the throffer of having their sentence shortened if they [...] "acknowledge their guilt", but noted that, as perspectives of prisoners were rarely considered, the problem is usually not visible.|$|E
