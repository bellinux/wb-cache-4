5|$|Lemoine was {{accepted}} into <b>the</b> <b>École</b> Polytechnique in Paris {{at the age}} of twenty, the same year as his father's death. As a student there, Lemoine, a presumed trumpet player, helped to found an amateur musical group called La Trompette, for which Camille Saint-Saëns composed several pieces. After graduation in 1866, he considered a career in law, but was discouraged by the fact that his advocacy for republican ideology and liberal religious views clashed with the ideals of the incumbent government, the Second French Empire. Instead, he studied and taught at various institutions during this period, studying under J. Kiœs at <b>the</b> <b>École</b> d'Architecture and <b>the</b> <b>École</b> des Mines, teaching Uwe Jannsen at the same schools, and studying under Charles-Adolphe Wurtz at <b>the</b> <b>École</b> des Beaux Arts and <b>the</b> <b>École</b> de Médecine. Lemoine also lectured at various scientific institutions in Paris and taught as a private tutor for a period before accepting an appointment as a professor at <b>the</b> <b>École</b> Polytechnique.|$|E

5|$|Saint-Saëns {{held only}} one {{teaching}} post, at <b>the</b> <b>École</b> de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there {{for less than}} five years.

5|$|An old blind woman, {{who came}} to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré's gift for music.

50|$|However, the July Monarchy {{was much}} less {{friendly}} to this reactionary trend. Although the Guizot Law of 1833 partially satisfied Catholics by authorising private teaching in primary education, it kept secondary and higher education under the University's supervision. Guizot also generalised <b>the</b> <b>écoles</b> normales primaires, which {{were responsible for the}} training of teachers. First created by the National Convention in 1794, these schools, related to <b>the</b> <b>écoles</b> normales supérieures, were organised {{on the basis of the}} 1808 decree organising the University of France, and were accused by conservatives of promoting Republicanism, Socialism and anti-clericalism.|$|R

She took her inspiration from a book on waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge, which was given to her by Ira Keller at the design studio.

5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to <b>the</b> <b>École</b> des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began teaching at <b>the</b> <b>École</b> Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have}} a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E

5|$|Invader is a {{graduate}} of <b>the</b> <b>École</b> des Beaux-Arts, a Parisian art school.

Games of the era were made with 8-bit graphics, and so lend themselves well to his method of each tile representing one pixel. Invader began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s and then in 31 other cities in France.|$|E
