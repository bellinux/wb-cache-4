[...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Thompson's {{father died}} as a result of circulatory {{problems}} at the age of 52. The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much I regret his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I've done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power." ...|$|E
500|$|When Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He {{had just}} {{finished}} a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, {{and it is clear}} from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: [...] "I am almost afraid <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together." ...|$|E

Oh, could I {{have that}} thought, I should not love thee; Thy soul is proof {{to all things}} but to kindness; And {{therefore}} 'twas that I forbore <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>How</b> mad Cassandra, full of prophecy, Ran round the streets, and, like a Bacchanal, Cried,--Hold him, Priam, 'tis an ominous day; Let him not go, for Hector is no more.|$|R

500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

2500|$|On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress {{to declare}} war on Germany. One week later, Theodore Roosevelt asked President Wilson for {{permission}} to lead a [...] "Rough Rider"-type regiment against the Germans in France. While Roosevelt was waiting for Wilson's answer, he got some kidding from his friend Masterson, who wrote Roosevelt on May 14, 1917: [...] "I wish you would arrange for an appointment with Tex Rickard and myself to meet you at your office when convenient. We want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to organize your European expedition and how to win your battles when you get there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chicago Mayor Edward Kelly also {{received}} a note:This is <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> sorry I am not to not get ole [...] Degnan instead of his girl. Roosevelt and the OPA made their own laws. Why shouldn't I and a lot more? At the time, there was a nationwide meatpackers strike and the Office of Price Administration OPA was talking of extending rationing to dairy products. Degnan was a senior OPA executive recently transferred to Chicago. Another executive of the OPA had recently been assigned armed guards after receiving threats against his children and, in Chicago, a man involved with black market meat had recently been murdered by decapitation. Police considered the possibility the Degnan killer was a meat packer.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, she {{recorded}} the album [...] "82" [...] with music director Mandar Agashe who decorated six of Suresh Bhat's ghazals with his musical touch of pop, reggae, blues, and rock. The album {{was named after}} her age {{at the time of}} recording. About the album [...] "8", Bhosle said, [...] "I had a long association with Suresh Bhat and have a lot of memories about him. With this album, I will relive those memories. I don't need <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> powerful his words were and, with the album, that power can be experienced again. Mr. Bhat always wanted to record these ghazals in the pop and rock genres and it is good to see Mandar fulfilling that wish. I just wish Mr. Bhat was among us today." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} chapter of his 1961 classic The Rhetoric of Fiction, Wayne C. Booth quotes the [...] "fine young novelist" [...] Harris as saying: [...] "You will no more expect the novelist <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{precisely}} <b>how</b> something is said than you will expect him to stand by your chair and hold your book." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "I {{have had}} three adventurous months since I last saw you. I know the Police Court, the Quarter Sessions Court, the High Court with one judge and the High Court with five judges. But {{whenever}} the court {{let me go}} I was arrested again. I have learnt to speak English better. Perhaps I do not speak King's English but it's Kisch English anyhow. I did not come here to tell there is terrorism in Europe. I come here <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to stop it. I have been an eye-witness. I was arrested the day the Reichstag was burnt down by Göring and his lieutenants. I saw my friend, Erich Mühsam, the poet, whose works I translated, made to walk naked, even in winter, and to lick up the spittle of his captors. All his limbs were broken gradually, and he died." ...|$|E
2500|$|You scold {{me so much}} in {{the nice}} long letter which I have this moment {{received}} from you, that I am almost afraid <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which he did when he was wounded.|$|E
