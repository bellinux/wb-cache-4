5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from <b>their</b> <b>mother.</b> Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E

40|$|Free radical {{injury is}} thought {{to be one of the}} common {{mechanisms}} for several diseases in preterm infants. Lipid peroxidation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many neonatal complications because the antioxidant system of preterm infants is highly stressed and incompletely developed. We aimed to determine the oxidative stress [Malondialdehyde (MDA) ] and antioxidants [Total antioxidant activity (TAA) and Vitamin E] in cord blood of preterm (n= 20) and term infants (n= 20) and in the blood of <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> In preterm infants and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> TAA and Vitamin E levels were low as compared to term infants and <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> In preterm infants and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> MDA was high as compared to term infants and <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Therefore it is possible to postulate that preterm infants and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> are more susceptible to oxidative stress than term infants and <b>their</b> <b>mothers...</b>|$|R

In October 1944, Bloeme and her group were selected for transfer to the Liebau labor camp in Upper Silesia. For the filming of the 1995 BBC documentary Anne Frank Remembered, Bloeme recalled that Anne, Margot, and <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> Edith, also planned to join the transport, but Anne was prohibited from joining because she had developed scabies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} oxidant/ {{antioxidant}} status of newborn babies with oesophageal atresia and <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> compared with healthy control subjects. METHODS: This case–control study included 40 participants: 10 newborns with oesophageal atresia and <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> and 10 healthy newborns and <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Whole blood malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and {{the activities of}} antioxidant enzymes (catalase, carbonic anhydrase [CA], glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase [G- 6 -PD], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) were measured. RESULTS: MDA levels and CA activity were significantly higher, and catalase, SOD and G- 6 -PD activities were significantly lower, in newborns with oesophageal atresia and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> than in healthy newborns and <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Although CA activity was similar between the newborns and mothers in the patient group, it was significantly lower in newborns than in mothers in the healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: Increased lipid peroxidation might {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of oesophageal atresia.
