5|$|The tenth {{play and}} new {{companion}} piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies, The Welsh Opera, ran many times {{until it was}} expanded into The Grub-Street Opera. The expanded version of the play, The Grub-Street Opera, was not put on for an audience, which provoked E. Rayner to print The Welsh Opera without Fielding's consent. The play serves both {{as a tribute to}} the Scriblerians, especially Gay and Gay's The Beggar's Opera, and <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. In particular, it mocked the feud between Walpole and Pulteney, a Privy Councillor.|$|E

However, this was not permitted by the USAC. Thus, the election to replace Monserratt was between Mike Meehan and Mike Soules (who had already lost in the primary and endorsed Mike Meehan), with Meehan eventually winning.|$|E

An employee with high self-efficacy is confident that effort he or she puts forth has a high likelihood of resulting in success. In anticipation of success, an employee is willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> more effort, persist longer, remain focused on the task, seek feedback and choose more effective task strategies.|$|E

25|$|Dissatisfaction with Russian autocracy {{culminated in}} the huge {{national}} upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops. Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> the October Manifesto, which established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma). The Tsar undermined this promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906 Fundamental State Laws, and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy.|$|E
25|$|The Welsh Opera was {{a tribute}} to the Scriblerians, {{especially}} to John Gay and to his most famous work The Beggar's Opera. This served as a means <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> a general political view and deal with politics in a more critical way unlike any of Fielding's previous plays. The play is a political allegory that satirises Robert Walpole's government and the British monarchy. Fielding also used Gay's technique of swapping London for a pastoral environment. Within the play, a country household represents England and the people represent various leaders and political figures. Fielding also adds many praises of the pastoral life along with favourably portraying roast beef and tobacco while mocking anything foreign.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} power gradually {{shifted to the}} civil officials, while that of the nobility and military establishment waned, {{even though they had}} been important members of the ruling elite during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. The consequence was that eunuchs were unable to gather enough support to initiate projects opposed by the civil government. Civil officials would remain wary of the eunuchs' attempts to re-initiate the treasure voyages, because the latter continued <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> suggestions for Ming emperors to emulate the achievements of the Yongle reign. However, no later emperor would seriously consider re-initiating the expeditions. The withdrawal of Ming China's treasure fleet left an enormous void in the foreign imperial dominance over the Indian Ocean.|$|E

25|$|The Task Force {{sought the}} {{endorsement}} of both the LDS Church and the BSA. The Church’s General Scouting Committee decided to recommend the Varsity Scouting program “with some reservations”. However, the Presidency of the Young Men grew increasingly uneasy {{and asked for a}} delay in implementation. New materials developed by the Church to support the Aaronic Priesthood Quorums had been developed and were about to be released. They felt that a simultaneous introduction of the Varsity Scouting program and the Aaronic Priesthood materials would “muscle the quorum program into the background” and that “the expectations made of the local leaders will become complicated beyond their capacity”. They went on <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> an alternative plan that did not involve Varsity Scouting.|$|E
25|$|The Grub Street Opera is {{the first}} truly {{political}} play and also Fielding's first ballad opera. As such it owes a lot to Fielding's model, John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. Unlike his other Scriblerus plays, Fielding's Scriblerus persona in The Grub-Street Opera is deeply connected to Gay instead of Gay's fellow members of the Scriblerus Club, Alexander Pope or Jonathan Swift. As in The Welsh Opera, this connection served as a means <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> a general political view and deal with politics in a more critical way unlike any of Fielding's previous plays. The play is a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. However, the play does not pick a side but pokes fun at everyone. He also kept his personal political views out of the play.|$|E
25|$|After a brief retirement, Clay won {{election}} to the House in 1822, and began considering his first presidential bid. By 1822, {{several members of the}} dominant Democratic-Republican Party had begun exploring presidential bids to succeed Monroe, who planned to retire after two terms like his predecessors. The Federalist Party had almost totally collapsed at this point, and the party failed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> a presidential candidate. Re-elected as Speaker in 1823, Clay passed the Tariff of 1824 and the General Survey Act, and Clay campaigned on his American System of high tariffs and federal spending on infrastructure. As the election approached, three members of Monroe's Cabinet, Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, appeared to be Clay's strongest competitors for the presidency. In 1822, the Tennessee legislature elected General Andrew Jackson to the Senate, and his backers also began to prepare for a presidential candidacy. Though many (including Clay) did not take his candidacy seriously at first, Jackson's emergence threatened Clay's presidential chances, since both candidates had a strong following in the western states. Jackson's supporters devised new campaign strategies by building grassroots networks that bypassed party bosses, signalling the rise of Jacksonian democracy. Crawford won the Republican congressional nominating caucus, which had decided previous Republican nominees, but the caucus had come {{to be seen as a}} vestige of elitism and Crawford's caucus victory actually hurt his popularity. In the Fall of 1823, Crawford suffered a major stroke, while Calhoun withdrew after Jackson won the support of the Pennsylvania legislature. The 1824 election thus had four major candidates, all of them Democratic-Republicans: Adams of Massachusetts, Crawford of Georgia, Jackson of Tennessee, and Clay of Kentucky. Ideologically, Adams and Clay both supported a relatively strong federal government, while Crawford and Jackson tended to oppose federal infrastructure projects, instead favoring stronger state governments.|$|E

In {{the case of the}} 1946 Orange Bowl, African American players Wallace Triplett and Dennis Hoggard could not participate due to the local police department's rules and the [...] "incidents" [...] that were expected to occur if they were allowed to play.

But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments.

500|$|As a symbol, an urn cannot {{completely}} represent poetry, {{but it does}} {{serve as}} one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity. The nightingale of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being a piece of art, the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>forth</b> a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, and {{the silence of the}} urn reinforces the imagination's ability to operate. This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis – the contemplation of art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself. In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures {{in a manner similar to}} [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". The figures on the urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term [...] "Truth". The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.|$|E
