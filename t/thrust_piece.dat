From this old store-room, for such it doubtless was, ran more steps, ending, to all appearance, in a blank wall. Coming to it, Ithiel <b>thrust</b> a <b>piece</b> of flat iron, a foot or more in length, into a crack in this wall, lifted some stone latch within, and pushed, whereon a block of masonry of something more than the height and width of a man, and quite a yard in thickness, swung outwards.

The person to whom he spoke, being one in some authority, rebuked the others for their incivility, and commanding one fellow {{to take care of the}} strangers' horses, he desired them to follow him. The Countess retained presence of mind sufficient to see that it was absolutely necessary she should comply with his request; and leaving the rude lackeys and grooms to crack their brutal jests about light heads, light heels, and so forth, Wayland and she followed in silence the deputy-usher, who undertook to be their conductor.|$|R

60|$|One {{band was}} busily {{engaged in a}} game exactly similar to our blind man's buff. Another set were walking on stilts, which raised the {{children}} three feet from the ground. They were very expert at this amusement, and seldom tumbled. In another place I observed a group of girls standing together, and apparently enjoying themselves very much; so I went up {{to see what they}} were doing, and found that they were opening their eyelids with their fingers till their eyes appeared of an enormous size, and then <b>thrusting</b> <b>pieces</b> of straw between the upper and lower lids, across the eyeball, to keep them in that position! This seemed to me, I must confess, a very foolish as well as dangerous amusement. Nevertheless, the children seemed to be greatly delighted with the hideous faces they made. I pondered this subject a good deal, and thought that if little children knew how silly they seemed to grown-up people when, they make faces, they would not be so fond of doing it. In another place were a number of boys engaged in flying kites; and I could not help wondering that some of the games of those little savages should be so like to our own, although they had never seen us at play. But the kites were different from ours in many respects, being of every variety of shape. They were made of very thin cloth, and the boys raised them to a wonderful height in the air by means of twine made from the cocoa-nut husk. Other games there were, some of which showed the natural depravity of the hearts of these poor savages, and made me wish fervently that missionaries might be sent out to them. But the amusement which the greatest number of the children of both sexes seemed to take chief delight in was swimming and diving in the sea, and the expertness which they exhibited was truly amazing. They seemed to have two principal games in the water, one of which was to dive off a sort of stage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea, and chase each other in the water. Some of them went down to an extraordinary depth; others skimmed along the surface, or rolled over and over like porpoises, or diving under each other, came up unexpectedly and pulled each other down by a leg or an arm. They never seemed to tire of this sport, and from the great heat of the water in the South Seas, they could remain in it nearly all day without feeling chilled. Many of these children were almost infants, scarce able to walk; yet they staggered down the beach, flung their round, fat little black bodies fearlessly into deep water, and struck out to sea with as much confidence as ducklings.|$|R
60|$|The blame {{of their}} city evils is not {{altogether}} with the gentlemen, chiefly of foreign extraction, {{who control the}} city. These find a people made to their hand--a lawless breed ready to wink at one evasion of the law if they themselves may profit by another, and in their rare leisure hours content to smile over {{the details of a}} clever fraud. Then, says the cultured American, 'Give us time. Give us time, and we shall arrive.' The otherwise American, who is aggressive, straightway proceeds to <b>thrust</b> a <b>piece</b> of half-hanged municipal botch-work under the nose of the alien as a sample of perfected effort. There is nothing more delightful than to sit for a strictly limited time with a child who tells you what he means to do when he is a man; but when that same child, loud-voiced, insistent, unblushingly eager for praise, but thin-skinned as the most morbid of hobbledehoys, stands about all your ways telling you the same story in the same voice, you begin to yearn for something made and finished--say Egypt and a completely dead mummy. It is neither seemly nor safe to hint that the government of the largest city in the States is a despotism of the alien by the alien for the alien, tempered with occasional insurrections of the decent folk. Only the Chinaman washes the dirty linen of other lands.|$|R
60|$|As {{no farther}} {{objection}} was offered, it only remained with Julian to thank and reward {{those who had}} been active in his assistance.

They would have remained to protect him, but, fearful of farther disorder, and relying entirely on the good faith of Major Bridgenorth, he dismissed them all except Lance, whom he detained to attend upon him for a few minutes, till he should depart from Moultrassie. But ere leaving the Hall, he could not repress his desire to speak with Bridgenorth in secret; and advancing towards him, he expressed such a desire.|$|R
60|$|The days passed. The wind grew colder, and one subdued dawn we {{awoke to}} find that the pines had fantastic white arms, and the stream ran black between white banks. All that day, and for many days after, the snow added silently to the {{thickness}} of its blanket, and winter was upon us. It was a long winter and a rare one. Polly Ann sat by the little window of the cabin, spinning the flax into linsey-woolsey.

Environmental issues will continue to influence social, economic and political thought as we move towards midcentury.

5000|$|Spoorbek {{was widely}} {{credited}} {{with the ability to}} prevent and put out fires. Thatch roofs under his protection would not burn - even when tested. The homestead Uitvlucht used to be pointed out as one of the dwellings under his protection. Spoorbek took part in the 1834 defense of Kerkplaats (now Alexandria) in the Olifantshoek area against the Xhosa during the 6th Xhosa War (1834-1836). All the houses in town were destroyed and the settlers made their last stand in the schoolhouse. When the Xhosa horde surrounded the schoolhouse and tried to burn it down, Spoorbek assured the townsfolk: [...] "Wees gerus, die skoolhuis sal nie brand" [...] (Be calm, the schoolhouse will not burn). The Xhosa warriors repeatedly <b>thrust</b> flaming <b>pieces</b> of wood into the thatch roof of the schoolhouse, but it did not catch fire. After hours of shooting, the settlers managed to drive the Xhosaâs away. All the other buildings, including the church, were burned down. Only the schoolhouse was unharmed and stands to this day. In another case, a house was on fire and Spoorbek was called in to help. He allegedly rode around the house in a circle with his white horse and dragged a long staff on the ground. After he completed the circle around the house the fire leaped from the roof onto the magic circle. Spoorbek rode away on his horse and the flames followed him - most possessions in the house were saved from the fire. In another account, Spoorbek put out a fire in a sheepkraal between Bedford and AdelaÃ¯de which smouldered for eight days despite constant rain. He gave the farmer three pieces of white paper and told him: [...] "Gooi dit in die brandende kraal, loop, en kijk nie om" [...] (Throw it in the burning kraal, walk away, and do not look back). The man did what Spoorbek told him and the smouldering fire was extinguished.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{analysis}} and FTIR spectroscopy {{of organic matter}} dispersed in sediments, as well as X-ray diffraction of clay minerals were performed on the Mesozoic-Cenozoic successions of the outer Carpathian fold-andthrust belt and the Paleozoic successions of the Podolia foreland in order to unravel the thermal evolution of the Carpathian orogenic system. Our results indicate higher thermal maturity for samples collected in the Podolia foreland {{with respect to the}} Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt. In the Carpathian area a decreasing trend of thermal maturity can be recognized moving from Cretaceous formations to the Oligocene-Miocene ones with values comprised between the immature and mature stage of hydrocarbon generation. This trend is preserved in all the analyzed <b>thrust</b> sheets. This <b>piece</b> of evidence suggests a weak influence of tectonic loading due to thrust emplacement since Early Miocene on thermal maturity distribution. On the other hand, petrographic and mineralogical data from Podolia foreland show thermal maturity levels compatible with late diagenetic conditions. These values are not justified for an area that was not deformed by the Caledonian and Variscan orogenic phases and where structural data do not show any evidence of deformation that can justify the observed levels of thermal maturity. A possible cause of the high thermal maturity may be the occurrence of high heat flow values close to the major tectonic lineament of the Trans-European Suture Zone.

5000|$|During the Sundance, {{the arrow}} <b>thrust</b> through the <b>piece</b> of meat {{represents}} the arrow {{in the side}} of the buffalo woman. Both arrow and meat are placed in the Thunder's nest as an offering. The man's child looking like his mother is in accord with the Cheyenne kinship system by which a child belongs to the mother's people. The child became a buffalo calf because the buffalo people were his mother's tribe. Red and black paint used on the rafter beams and center pole of the Medicine Lodge are symbols of the painted sticks using in the great race. During the final dance in the Medicine Lodge, the instructor and pledger dance side by side. While they are dancing, the instructor pushes the pledger against the cottonwood brush surrounding the altar. This represents the attempt of the buffalo grandfather to push the Suhtai over the edge of the cliff. The only part of the buffalo not eaten by the Cheyenne was the sweetbreads (thymus gland) which the Cheyenne call âhuman fat'. This was because the [...] "buffalo originally ate human beings." [...] It is believed that some buffalo that had killed a man were surprised by enemies. They fled, taking some human flesh with them. This fat became internalized in the buffalo, leaving a residue of human flesh in the buffalo's body to this day.|$|R
40|$|China {{has shown}} a âdismayingly {{cavalier}} attitude toward the well-being of its people,â a British journalist turned pop historian determined recently {{in the pages of}} the New York Times. The Chinese, he explained, long ago handed over science â and by extension earthquake resistant engineering â to âthe West,â leaving âthemselves to become mired, time and again, in the kind of tragic events that we are witnessing this week. â The <b>thrust</b> of this <b>piece</b> by Simon Winchester (which simultaneously appeared in the International Herald Tribune and evidently stems from his latest books, The Man Who Loved China (2008), on Joseph Needham, the chronicler of the history of Chinese science, and A Crack in the Edge of the World(2005), on the San Francisco quake of 1906) was Chinaâs fall in the sixteenth century from mankindâs technological pioneer to a âculture that turned its back on its remarkable and glittering historyâ and âbecame impoverished, backward and prey to the caprices of nature. â On the face of it, this bestselling author is right to point out that China has a long way to go with quake-resistant construction. The fact that Sichuan, until recently Chinaâs biggest province by population, is a mountainous area where landslides and cracked dams exacerbate such disasters does not help. But by asking why China has not kept pace with âAmericaâ on this, Winchester forgets that Western advances in this regard are remarkably recent. San Francisco, as he well knows, was reduced to a pancake in 1906. And I donât know what he means by todayâs âAmericaâ (trend-setting San Francisco? or the trailer home communities across the country that fly like poker cards from every tornado?) but the University of California from which I am writing started retro-fitting its buildings just in the last few decades. Winchester must then mean China is a few decades behind, but he makes it sound like centuries...|$|R
40|$|Sibelius {{repeatedly}} {{maintained that}} tempo fluctuations in his music {{ought to be}} barely perceptible. Dealing with the subtle tempo modulations in the one-movement Seventh Symphony is thus not surprisingly {{one of the most}} challenging aspects of performing the piece. The present study addresses the matters of time and tempo from a variety of perspectives: harmony, compositional process, metronome markings. Throughout, the piece reveals itself as an organism evolving through and in time. First, we look at ways in which harmonic interruptions and sonic echoes are used to create at once continuity and discontinuity in the musical narrative. Borrowing terms from literary studies, we examine the importance of aposiopesis and stylems (a term whose use is owed to Antonin ServiÃ¨re) in the symphony. Each of these forms of interruption exerts a contrary force on the forward <b>thrust</b> of the <b>piece</b> that affects one's experience of time. Second, we examine Sibelius's compositional process by looking at the evolution of the piece from sketch to final form. This analysis reveals the composer stripping away cadences, strategically inserting pedal points, shifting tempo markings to avoid structural downbeats, all to achieve an elasticity and fluidity of time where the perception of tempo changes is blurred. Third, we look at Sibelius's metronome markings. While they contain helpful information, they also withhold information, particularly about the first 93 bars of the piece. We take stock of what this absence reveals about the structure of the piece and about problems in performance related to time and tempo. The ending of the piece receives separate treatment as it is particularly revelatory of Sibelius's compositional process. Here, what the composer discarded sheds light on the enigmatic but highly poetic final version of the ending of the piece. Finally, we offer in the appendix a performance history of the Seventh Symphony. The difficulty of programming this concise but epic work accounts to some measure for its lack of performance. The two tables {{at the end of this}} study are intended as a resource for conductors seeking to program this poetic work...|$|R
40|$|I {{imagine this}} piece {{as a kind}} of {{instrumental}} opera, in which the solo cello assumes the lead role amidst a cast of supporting characters â i. e. the eight other players. In the first movement, âPrologue,â various combinations of the ensemble serve as a Greek Chorus that precedes the main drama of the work. At the pieceâs beginning, the solo cellist acts as an accompanist to this chorus. Gradually, as the movement unfolds, the cello emerges as the soloist, culminating in a cadenza or âsoliloquyâ {{at the end of the}} first movement. In the episodic second movement, âAct One,â I envision a series of short, unfolding arias compacted into a span of six minutes â culminating in a melodic passage full of nostalgic associations. The third and shortest movement, âDances and Interludesâ is a light and casual jaunt featuring pizzicato cello, double bass, and bassoon. I think of it as a dramatic foil between the weightier second and fourth movements. The fourth movement, âAct Two,â is the workâs core. Here, an increasingly fraught and virtuosic cello solo is underpinned by call-and-response gestures between the accompanying strings and woodwinds. Fast and unrelenting, the movement builds through a series of climaxes, with an enflamed cadenza halfway through the movement. Before the final and most violent crescendo, a lone bassoon recalls a frail and fleeting fragment of Act Oneâs nostalgic âaria. â In the fifth and last movement, âEpilogue and Processional,â the cello takes on a meditative and lyrical character â with a slow, simple ostinato rolling forward in the piano and bass. I imagine this movement as both a love scene and ritualistic procession. Several narrative threads run throughout the course of the five movements. For example, overall, the general <b>thrust</b> of the <b>piece</b> is from the lowest registers to the highest â as embodied in the solo cellistâs move from the lowest C in bar one to the highest E in the penultimate measure. Another narrative strand is the reoccurrence and reorchestration of unisons throughout the piece â most obviously in Movements I, III and V...|$|R
40|$|Extract: Although it is a trite {{fact that}} legal {{scholars}} {{ought to be}} concerned about the status and future of legal scholarship, it is rare to find an article that grapples with the problem in an honest and unambiguous fashion. This is why I found Professor Lassonâs commentary on âScholarship Amok: Excesses in the Pursuit of Truth and Tenureâ most instructive and thought-provoking. The commentary touched, in fact, upon many personal concerns that have long troubled me about legal scholarship generally (indeed, it should be mentioned, many of the issues canvassed in the commentary can be generalised, with modifications of course, to apply to many other disciplines as well). These concerns, as well as the fact that the commentary has (to the best of my knowledge) received little comment, have prompted the present response. In deference to the general thrust and tenor of Professor Lassonâs commentary, however, have refrained from using many footnotes; I have in fact, ensured that the various arguments are as highly condensed as possible. It is also hoped that, if nothing else, this brief response would have achieved two broader objectives â that it will be of at least some interest to readers of the Legal Education Review; and secondly, that Professor Lasson will be gratified by the fact that his views are being taken seriously by academics outside the United States of America. There are many things to applaud in Professor Lassonâs commentary â above all, his timely reminder that âlaw review scholarshipâ ought not to be the sole determinant of oneâs status in the academy. His honesty, albeit tinged with a sharp edge at times in the style of the late Professor Rodell, is, as already alluded to above, refreshing and his wry humour (witness for example, his âelaborateâ graph at note 60 which is reminiscent of Robin Williamsâ putdown of âmechanistic poetryâ in âDead Poets Societyâ) is more than welcome. What is disturbing, however, is his very sweeping and all too reductionist view of legal scholarship. He does not persuade me why his rather drastic observations (mostly negative) ought to prevail. The fact that law reviews will probably continue to thrive (as Lasson himself admits) does not, of course, swing the argument the other way either. I thus propose to briefly review the main <b>thrust</b> of his <b>piece</b> in order to demonstrate why it does not hold, in the final analysis...|$|R
