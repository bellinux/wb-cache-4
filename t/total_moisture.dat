50|$|In winter, Mediterranean climate zones {{come into}} contact with the {{westerlies}} and associated periodic storms can reach into the mediterranean climate zones. Since the high-pressure anticyclones are no longer there to deflect storms away from these regions, thunderstorms and heavy rain become possible. As a result, areas with this climate receive almost all of their precipitation during their winter and spring seasons, and may go anywhere from 3 to 6 months during the summer without having any significant precipitation. In the lower latitudes, precipitation usually decreases in both the winter and summer because they are closer to the Horse Latitudes which brings calm winds and clear skies; thus bringing smaller amounts of rain. Toward the polar latitudes, <b>total</b> <b>moisture</b> usually increases; the Mediterranean climate in Southern Europe has more rain. The rainfall also tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the year in Southern Europe, while in the Eastern Mediterranean (the Levant) and in Southern California the summer is nearly or completely dry and the dry season most severe. Places where evapotranspiration is higher, steppe climates tend to prevail, but still follow the weather pattern of the Mediterranean climate.|$|E

And the type of processing is also essential in harvesting the grain's maximum nutrition. Feeding steam-flaked sorghum showed an increase in milk production when compared to dry-rolling. When a grain is steam-flaked, it is cooked slightly, this makes certain nutrients more available to be digested.|$|E

Pre-rigor pressure treated cooked beef portions showed significantly (P< 0. 05) greater <b>total</b> <b>moisture,</b> pH, exterior a+ color values and subjective tenderness and ease of fiber separation scores than the untreated portions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Water or a {{phosphate}} {{salt solution}} {{was added to}} turkey breast muscle. The effects of those additives on the stability of cooked, stored muscle were determined by physical and chemical measurements. Adding phosphate salt solution to freshly cooked or reheated muscle resulted in increased percentage <b>total</b> <b>moisture</b> in those samples. <b>Total</b> <b>moisture,</b> however, was not affected by adding water probably because injected water was not bound by the muscle. Volume of expressed juice was greater in freshly cooked than in reheated muscle but was not affected by either added phosphate or added water. Water activity (Aw), measured as the equilibrium relative humidity of the atmosphere above a sample, was not affected by additive or heating treatment. Physical determinations of moisture were correlated with sensory impressions of juiciness. <b>Total</b> <b>moisture</b> was correlated positively with panel scores for juiciness; however, there also was {{a positive relationship between}} panel scores for juiciness and percentage cooking loss. As would be expected, the addition of phosphate salts increased the pH of muscle. Storage and/or reheating resulted in increased TBA values. The phosphate-treated, reheated sample had a TBA value below that of freshly cooked samples, indicating that phosphate salts retarded oxidative changes in cooked, stored muscle.

40|$|ABSTRACT Chicken for a prebrowned {{fried chicken}} product was soaked in {{phosphate}} (Kena) and/or salt for 16 hours, then fried, {{to evaluate the}} effect of marination solutions. This was followed by an evaluation of eight cooking methods. These methods included precooking by: steaming, simmering, boiling, all followed by breading, battering and breading then frying to brown; and breading, battering and breading followed by deep fat frying to doneness. Also included were four methods involving steaming after breading and/or battering and breading. The methods were evaluated by taste paneling for tender-ness, juiciness, flavor and overall acceptability. Shear press values, <b>total</b> <b>moisture</b> and yields were determined. Marination in 1 - 3 % Kena improved flavor and yield, reduced shear values and in-creased <b>total</b> <b>moisture</b> {{when compared to the}} unsoaked control. Adding salt with the Kena improved flavor as well, after four days of refrigerated storage. Evaluation of the cooking methods indicated that simmering was slightly the best of the precook methods.
