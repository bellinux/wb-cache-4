25|$|In March {{the same}} year, Lebanese National Movement leader Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. The murder was widely {{blamed on the}} Syrian government. While Jumblatt's role {{as leader of the}} Druze Progressive Socialist Party was filled {{surprisingly}} smoothly by his son, Walid Jumblatt, the LNM disintegrated after his death. Although the anti-government pact of leftists, Shi'a, Sunni, Palestinians and Druze would stick together for some time more, their wildly divergent interests <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> opposition unity. Sensing the opportunity, Hafez al-Assad immediately began splitting up both the Maronite and Muslim coalitions in a game of divide and conquer.|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-documented}} gunfight {{resulted in}} the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854. Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out of the brush, pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way. Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being [...] "in a fever of excitement at the time." [...] Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws' bullets <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> Davis's clothing, but caused only two slight flesh wounds. Within moments, seven of the bandits were dead or dying {{on the ground and}} Davis's pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis whipped out his Bowie knife, and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011 Jello Biafra and his band were {{scheduled}} {{to play at the}} Barby Club in Tel Aviv. They came under heavy pressure by the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, and finally decided to cancel the gig – after a debate which according to Biafra [...] "deeply <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> the fabric of our band [...] This whole controversy {{has been one of the}} most intense situations of my life – and I thrive on intense situations".|$|E
2500|$|Firmus gained {{support for}} his revolt (372–375) from three of his {{brothers}} and from Mauri tribal allies that he through his family could summons to the struggle. Also attracted were the dissendent Donatist Christian churches, and anti-Roman, anti-taxation sentiment. Evidently Firmus styled himself King of Mauritania. Perhaps {{he went over to}} the side of the rural dispossessed and championed their cause. Yet he was opposed by his younger brother Gildo, who remained aligned with Rome. The formidable Comes Theodosius (father of the future Emperor) led a Roman force to Africa against Firmus. The subsequent military campaign, wrote Ammianus, <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> social loyalties, [...] "disrupted the balance of power relationships in the region." [...] In the fighting that led to the defeat of Firmus, Gildo served the Romans under the Comes Theodosius.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the tornado}} hit, a SEC tournament game between Mississippi State and Alabama which {{had just been}} sent into {{overtime}} minutes earlier by a shot from Mykal Riley, was in progress at the Georgia Dome. [...] The storm ripped panels from {{the exterior of the}} building and <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> least two holes in the roof of the Dome, causing insulation to fall and the scoreboard and catwalks suspended from the roof to sway. [...] Mykal Riley's shot was considered to have saved lives by keeping people safe inside the Georgia Dome. [...] After a 64-minute delay, the game was completed, however the next scheduled game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed. [...] The remainder of the tournament games were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech, with spectators restricted to team and conference personnel, media, team bands, and families of players only due to the much smaller size of the alternate venue. At the nearby Philips Arena, little disruption was noticed by the attendees during the game between the Hawks and the Los Angeles Clippers, even though damage occurred to the outside of the arena.|$|E

2500|$|At dawn [...] {{set out to}} find , the Horned Monster. [...] He came to a broad plain at {{the foot}} of the mountains, and saw [...] lying at rest.

[...] "There is someone here I seek," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "Do you not fear , the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?" [...] asked Gopher.

[...] And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. [...] You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart." [...] , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. [...] "Raise your right leg," [...] said Gopher. [...] While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. [...] Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where [...] lay above the opening. [...] He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into [...] [...] The monster roared and <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. [...] <b>tore</b> <b>at</b> the earth around the tunnel. [...] Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. [...] dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. [...] began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. [...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "What brings you to this place?" [...] "I am looking at something," [...] said , Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder what you are looking at," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "I am looking at ," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder if I need fear him." [...] "I will go over there and see if he is dead," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. [...] If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." [...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. [...] So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. [...] And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that [...] was slain.|$|E
