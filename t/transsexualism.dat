After a period of charity work, he moved to Stockholm to study at Paideia, the European Institute for Jewish Studies in Sweden, on a one-year fellowship. In 2013, while living in Stockholm, he published some of his plays, {{as well as a}} dystopian novella called The People's Republic of Nowhere.|$|E
25|$|The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and <b>Transsexualism</b> is a 2003 book by the {{psychologist}} J. Michael Bailey, published by Joseph Henry Press.|$|E
25|$|Hepp, Milos, and Braun-Scharm {{state in}} their study on gender {{identity}} disorder and anorexia nervosa in male monozygotic twins that the correlation between childhood gender identity disorder and adult homosexuality is stronger than the correlation between childhood gender identity disorder and adult <b>transsexualism.</b> Cohen-Kettenis and Gooren note in their {{review of the literature}} on <b>transsexualism</b> that children with gender identity disorder are more likely to identify as gay or lesbian later in life, as opposed to identifying as transgender. Additionally, gay and lesbian adults report having exhibited more opposite-sex gender role behavior than heterosexual adults.|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>transsexualism</b> {{has also}} been {{included}} in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With the DSM-5, <b>transsexualism</b> was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria was created in its place. This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that transsexuality is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual people should not be stigmatized unnecessarily. By including a diagnosis for gender dysphoria, transsexual people are still able to access medical care through the process of transition.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} gender {{identity}} {{appeared in the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), {{in the form of}} two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and <b>transsexualism</b> (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R, added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and <b>transsexualism</b> into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder. In 2013, the DSM-5 renamed the diagnosis gender dysphoria and revised its definition.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{identity}} {{disorder in}} children is more heavily linked with adult homosexuality than adult <b>transsexualism.</b> According to limited studies, {{the majority of}} children diagnosed with GID cease to desire to be the other sex by puberty, with most growing up to identify as gay or lesbian with or without therapeutic intervention.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{dysphoria}} {{or gender}} identity disorder (GID) {{occurs when the}} child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as <b>transsexualism,</b> occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{writes of}} <b>transsexualism</b> in Hindu literature: [...] "Few {{cultures}} have accorded this phenomenon so prominent {{a place in}} the realms of mythology and religion as has that of traditional India." [...] Goldman considers the numerous myths concerning gender change to be a manifestation of patriarchal cultures desire to control the sexuality of women, but writes that many myths [...] "project a positive valuation of women and femininity". Changes in gender may be caused by a god or through the use of magic, in order to deceive others or to facilitate a romantic encounter. A change in gender may also occur spontaneously due to changes in a person's spiritual or moral character, either in a single life, or through reincarnation.|$|E
500|$|Tripp {{discusses}} bisexuality, inversion, transvestism, and <b>transsexualism</b> {{in relation}} to homosexuality. Tripp maintains that homosexuality and inversion, though sometimes associated with each other, are distinct phenomena. He argues that there are several different kinds of bisexuality, and that while some bisexuals are simply unconcerned by the gender of their sexual partners, others [...] "rate and choose their male and female partners by applying quite separate sets of criteria", which could be formed by various different processes, including {{but not limited to}} early sexual experiences with persons of both sexes, or for a men a special form of machismo. [...] Tripp argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and of non-conformist behavior in general, arguing that such respect for diversity has many potential benefits to society.|$|E
500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of <b>transsexualism</b> in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchard's <b>transsexualism</b> typology, also Blanchard autogynephilia {{theory and}} Blanchard's taxonomy, is a {{psychological}} typology of male-to-female (MtF) <b>transsexualism</b> created by Ray Blanchard through the 1980s and 1990s, {{building on the}} work of his colleague, Kurt Freund. [...] Blanchard divided trans women into two different groups: [...] "homosexual transsexuals", whom Blanchard says seek sex reassignment surgery to romantically and sexually attract (ideally heterosexual) men, and [...] "autogynephilic transsexuals" [...] who purportedly are sexually aroused at {{the idea of having a}} female body. [...] The typology suggests distinctions between MtF transsexuals, but does not speculate on the causes of <b>transsexualism.</b> This distinction is a recurring theme in scholarly literature on <b>transsexualism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Transsexualism</b> {{appears in}} the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD, {{currently}} in its tenth edition). The ICD-10 incorporates <b>transsexualism,</b> dual role transvestism, and gender identity disorder of childhood into its gender identity disorder category. It defines <b>transsexualism</b> as [...] " [...] desire to live and be accepted {{as a member of}} the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex." [...] The World Health Organisation lists <b>transsexualism</b> as a mental and behavioural disorder.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002, the Lord Chancellor's office {{published}} a Government Policy Concerning Transsexual People document that categorically states that <b>transsexualism</b> [...] "is not a mental illness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bailey's book The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender Bending and <b>Transsexualism</b> was {{published}} in 2003. In it, Bailey reviewed evidence that male homosexuality is innate, a result of heredity and prenatal environment. He also reviewed the theory of Ray Blanchard {{that there are two}} unrelated forms of <b>transsexualism,</b> one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a paraphilia known as autogynephilia. [...] Written in a popular science style, the book summarized research supporting Bailey's opinions.|$|E
2500|$|Because organ {{differentiation}} and brain differentiation occur at different times, {{in rare cases}} <b>transsexualism</b> can result. Only 23% of childhood gender problems will result in transsexuality in adulthood.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), {{and many}} {{transsexual}} people, have recommended {{the removal of}} <b>transsexualism</b> from the mental health chapter of the upcoming ICD, ICD-11 (due {{to be released in}} 2017). They argue that at least some mental health professionals are being insensitive by labelling <b>transsexualism</b> as [...] "a disease", rather than the inborn trait which those who have it believe it to be. Principle 18 of The Yogyakarta Principles, a document of international human rights law, opposes such diagnosis as mental illness as medical abuse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{early history}} {{of the study of}} <b>transsexualism</b> is sparse; however, the concept of a {{categorization}} of transsexual people can be seen as early as 1923 with the work of Magnus Hirschfeld. [...] In 1966, Harry Benjamin wrote that researchers of his day thought that attraction to men, while feeling that oneself is a woman, was the factor that distinguished a transvestite from a transsexual. [...] In 1980 in the DSM-III, a [...] new diagnosis was introduced, that of [...] "302.5 Transsexualism" [...] under [...] "Other Psychosexual Disorders". This was an attempt to provide a diagnostic category for gender identity disorders. The diagnostic category, <b>transsexualism,</b> was for gender dysphoric individuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in transforming their physical and social gender status. The subtypes were asexual, homosexual (same [...] "biological sex"), heterosexual (other [...] "biological sex") and unspecified. [...] This was removed in the DSM-IV, in which gender identity disorder replaced <b>transsexualism.</b> Previous taxonomies, or systems of categorization, used the terms classic transsexual or true transsexual, terms once used in differential diagnoses.|$|E
2500|$|The terms gender {{dysphoria}} and gender identity disorder {{were not used}} until the 1970s, when Laub and Fisk published several works on <b>transsexualism</b> using these terms. [...] "Transsexualism" [...] was replaced in the DSM-IV by [...] "gender identity disorder in adolescents and adults".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the second}} edition, LeVay {{added a new}} chapter dealing with aspects of {{sexuality}} and gender such as bisexuality, asexuality, attraction to different age groups, [...] "butch" [...] and [...] "femme" [...] behavior, preferences for different sexual roles or positions, and <b>transsexualism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Male-to-female <b>transsexualism</b> has {{sometimes}} been called [...] "Harry Benjamin's syndrome" [...] after the endocrinologist who pioneered the study of dysphoria. As the present-day medical study of gender variance is much broader than Benjamin's early description, there is greater understanding of its aspects, {{and use of the}} term Harry Benjamin's syndrome has been criticized for delegitimizing gender-variant people with different experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Penthouse Variations is {{a monthly}} {{magazine}} containing ostensibly reader generated erotic stories (primarily) and some pictures and reviews. It is a spin-off magazine from Penthouse Letters. [...] It was initially published in 1978. Variations focuses on [...] "kinkier" [...] topics of sexuality such as bondage, fetish clothing, exhibitionism, voyeurism, foot fetishism, water sports, female dominance, bisexual exploration, <b>transsexualism</b> and sadomasochism among others.|$|E
2500|$|In Talbot (otherwise Poyntz) v. Talbot in 1967, the {{prohibition}} {{was held to}} extend where one spouse was a post-operative transsexual, with Mr Justice Ormerod stating [...] "Marriage is a relationship which depends on sex, not on gender". In 1971, the Nullity of Marriage Act was passed, explicitly banning marriages between same-sex couples in England and Wales. The parliamentary debates on the 1971 act included discussion {{on the issue of}} <b>transsexualism</b> but not homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Transsexualism</b> was {{discussed}} {{in the mass media}} as long ago as the 1930s. The American magazine Time in 1936 devoted an article to what it called [...] "hermaphrodites", treating the subject with sensitivity and not sensationalism. It described the call by Avery Brundage, who led the American team to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, that a system be established to examine female athletes for [...] "sex ambiguities"; two athletes changed sex after the Games.|$|E
2500|$|Therapeutic {{approaches}} for GIDC {{differ from those}} used on adults and have included behavior therapy, psychodynamic therapy, group therapy, and parent counseling. Proponents of this intervention seek to reduce gender dysphoria, make children more comfortable with their bodies, lessen ostracism, and reduce the child's psychiatric comorbidity. The majority of therapists currently employ these techniques. [...] "Two short term goals have been discussed in the literature: the reduction or elimination of social ostracism and conflict, and the alleviation of underlying or associated psychopathology. Longer term goals {{have focused on the}} prevention of <b>transsexualism</b> and/or homosexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Darryl Hill stated, [...] "Zucker and Bradley {{believe that}} reparative {{treatments}} (encouraging {{the child to}} accept their natal sex and associated gender) can be therapeutic for several reasons. They believe that treatment can reduce social ostracism by helping gender non-conforming children mix more readily with same sex peers and prevent long-term psychopathological development (i.e., {{it is easier to}} change a child than a society intolerant of gender diversity). Reparative therapy is believed to reduce the chances of adult GID (i.e., <b>transsexualism)</b> which Zucker and Bradley characterize as undesirable." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{an initial}} {{psychological}} evaluation, trans men and trans women may begin medical treatment, starting with {{hormone replacement therapy}} or hormone blockers. In these cases, people who change their gender are usually required to live as members of their target gender {{for at least one}} year prior to genital surgery, gaining real-life experience, which is sometimes called the [...] "real-life test" [...] (RLT). Transsexual individuals may undergo some, all, or none of the medical procedures available, depending on personal feelings, health, income, and other considerations. Some people posit that <b>transsexualism</b> is a physical condition, not a psychological issue, and assert that sex reassignment therapy should be given on request. (Brown 103) ...|$|E
2500|$|Cauldwell {{appears to}} be the first to use the term to refer to those who desired a change of {{physiological}} sex. In 1969, Harry Benjamin claimed to have been the first to use the term [...] "transsexual" [...] in a public lecture, which he gave in December 1953. Benjamin went on to popularize the term in his 1966 book, The Transsexual Phenomenon, in which he described transsexual people on a scale (later called the [...] "Benjamin scale") of three levels of intensity: [...] "Transsexual (nonsurgical)", [...] "Transsexual (moderate intensity)", and [...] "Transsexual (high intensity)". In his book, Benjamin described [...] "true" [...] <b>transsexualism</b> as the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Drawing on some <b>transsexualism</b> cases, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab {{state that}} [...] "rom these {{examples}} {{it appears that}} the direct action of testosterone on the developing brain in boys and the lack of such action on the developing brain in girls are crucial factors in the development of male and female gender identity and sexual orientation ..." [...] Countless studies have been run on peripheral levels of sex steroids in male and female homosexuals, a considerable number of which claimed to find [...] "less 'male hormone' and/or more 'female hormone' in male homosexuals and vice versa in female homosexuals". [...] However, these findings have been reviewed and have subsequently been dismissed by scholars as suffering from faulty design and interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|Factors {{implicated in}} the {{development}} of transsexuality include chromosomal abnormalities, polymorphisms of certain genes, and variations in aromatase (cytochrome P450 CYP19) and CYP17. [...] Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia show an increase in probability of transsexuality later in life; however, this risk is still only 1–3% in CAH. [...] Although historically abnormal sexual differentiation has pointed to androgens as a causal factor, there are codeterminants of gender identity and sexual orientation with overriding effects of androgens on the brain, in male transsexuals or homosexuals, or making androgen effects on the brain redundant, as in female transsexuals or homosexuals. [...] These factors are currently unknown, and thus no clear cut answer for the cause of <b>transsexualism</b> and homosexuality exists.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} section of the book, Bailey {{discusses}} gender-atypical behaviors and gender dysphoria in children, emphasizing the biological determination of gender. [...] In the second section he deals primarily with gay men, including the link between childhood gender dysphoria and male homosexuality later in life. Bailey reviews evidence that male homosexuality is congenital (a result of genetics and prenatal environment), and he argues for the accuracy of some stereotypes about gay men. In the third section, Bailey summarizes evidence for a psychological typology of trans women that says there are two forms of <b>transsexualism</b> that affects transgender women: one that he describes as an extreme type of male homosexuality and one that is a sexual interest in having a female body, called autogynephilia.|$|E
2500|$|Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University {{coined the}} term {{transgender}} in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and Pathology, writing that the term which had previously been used, <b>transsexualism,</b> [...] "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism' is meant, because sexuality {{is not a major}} factor in primary transvestism." [...] The term transgender was then popularized with varying definitions by various transgender, transsexual, and transvestite people, including Virginia Prince, who used it in the December 1969 issue of Transvestia, a national magazine for cross dressers she founded. By the mid-1970s both trans-gender and trans people were in use as umbrella terms, and their spouses would not necessarily have been regarded as gender-different. In Mexico, the Zapotec culture includes a third gender {{in the form of the}} Muxe.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of <b>transsexualism,</b> the European Court of Human Rights in Goodwin v UK and I v UK (July 2002) {{concluded}} {{that there is no}} justification for barring a transsexual from enjoying the right to marry. In Bellinger v Bellinger [...] UKHL 21, (2003) Times, 11 April the English courts held that the non-recognition of change of gender for the purposes of marriage in s 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 was incompatible with Convention rights. But the House of Lords did not consider that the issues raised in the case were suitable for determination by courts and left the matter for Parliament, which has now enacted the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and matches the majority of European states in permitting marriage in the adoptive gender role. The same rights may be allowed in Australia, Canada, and some other states.|$|E
2500|$|The public {{response}} {{of members of}} the transgender community was almost entirely negative. Among other things, they opposed the book's endorsement of Blanchard's taxonomy of male-to-female <b>transsexualism,</b> and its publication by the National Academies Press, by whom it was [...] "advertised as science" [...] and marketed as [...] "scientifically accurate," [...] which they argued was untrue. [...] They also claimed the book exploited children with gender dysphoria. Among those criticizing the book were computer scientist Lynn Conway, biologists Joan Roughgarden and Ben Barres, physician Rebecca Allison, economist Deirdre McCloskey, psychologist Madeline Wyndzen, writers Dallas Denny, Pauline Park, Jamison Green, and Andrea James, as well as Christine Burns of Press for Change, and Executive Director Monica Casper of the Intersex Society of North America. James, a transgender advocate, attacked Bailey by constructing a website with pictures of Bailey's children taken from his public website beside sexually explicit captions, in one instance calling his young daughter a [...] "cock-starved exhibitionist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health is that treatment aimed at trying to change a person's gender identity and expression to become more congruent with sex assigned at birth [...] "is no longer considered ethical." [...] Clinicians have called Zucker and Bradley's therapeutic intervention [...] "something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals" [...] and have noted that the goal is preventing transsexualism: [...] "Reparative therapy is believed to reduce the chances of adult GID (i.e., <b>transsexualism)</b> which Zucker and Bradley characterize as undesirable." [...] Author Phyllis Burke wrote, [...] "The diagnosis of GID in children, as supported by Zucker and Bradley, is simply child abuse." [...] Zucker dismisses Burke's book as [...] "simplistic" [...] and [...] "not particularly illuminating;" [...] journalist Stephanie Wilkinson said Zucker characterized Burke's book as [...] "the work of a journalist whose views shouldn't be put into the same camp as those of scientists like Richard Green or himself." [...] However, strong critiques of Dr. Zucker's approach do not come from lay activists and journalists alone, but also from psychiatrists and psychologists within his own field. Edgardo Menvielle, a child-adolescent psychiatrist at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington states, [...] "Therapists who advocate changing gender variant behaviours should be avoided." [...] Developmental and clinical psychologist Diane Ehrensaft told the Psychiatric Times, [...] "The mental health profession has been consistently doing harm to children who are not 'gender normal,' {{and they need to}} retrain," ...|$|E
2500|$|This type of [...] "insensitivity" [...] is likened by Ştefănescu {{with that}} of [...] "a cadaver on a {{dissection}} table", or [...] "a statue that we can examine from all sides". The critic finds the work more daring than any possible analogy in local letters. He compares it to Miron Radu Paraschivescu's Jurnalul unui cobai ("The Diary of a Guinea Pig"), which is however [...] "unforgiving" [...] only with its author's acquaintances; to Livius Ciocârlie's diaries, which nevertheless [...] "remain with the limits of literary decency"; to Mircea Cărtărescu's Travesti novel, which discusses <b>transsexualism</b> in metaphors that make it [...] "less shocking." [...] The same overall comparison was made by critic Ioana Pârvulescu, who found Straja dragonilor to evade the tradition of Romanian autobiographical literature, {{in that it was}} freed from [...] "the obsession of the image", without courting the reader's sympathy. She adds: [...] "Approaching death is a guarantee for a sincerity of the best quality. The only danger that stalks among the pages is that of time running out, and this provides [...] chaotic impatience and hastening, like the agglomeration of the last sand grains inside the neck of an hourglass." [...] The episodes in Negoiţescu's book portray the boy as a seeker of promiscuous sexual experiences, who enjoys the advances of grownup males (such as his father's orderly), but also experiments with girls his own age. In one narrative sequence, the author recounts how, finding himself inside a dark cinema, he satisfied his urges by fondling the genitalia of an unknown man sitting next to him, thus taking a gamble with public condemnation of a homosexual acts. Such experiences, Stan proposes, reveal the protagonist-narrator to have been [...] "hedonistic", [...] "Dionysian" [...] and [...] "histrionic", characterized by an unwillingness in taking critical distance from [...] "the object of his contemplation", and displaying [...] "a psychology of the excess".|$|E
2500|$|A {{transgender}} {{woman that}} he {{described in the}} book {{filed a complaint with}} Northwestern University alleging that her many discussions with Bailey about his view of trans women and the book he was writing made her a non-consensual subject of IRB-regulated research by Bailey, and that during this time, she had consensual sex with him. Northwestern found no basis for the complaint. [...] Transgender professors Lynn Conway and Deirdre McCloskey filed a complaint against Bailey with Illinois state regulators, alleging that he practiced psychology without a license by providing brief case evaluation letters suggesting candidacy for sex reassignment surgery; however, the department did not pursue those allegations, as he did not accept remuneration for the services and therefore did not violate the law. [...] At least two women who said they were subjects in his book filed a complaint with Northwestern alleging that Bailey committed scientific misconduct by not informing them that they were to be the subjects of research used in the writing of his book. Northwestern did investigate this allegation. [...] Although the findings of that investigation were not released, Northwestern's Vice President for Research, C. Bradley Moore, said, [...] "The allegations of scientific misconduct made against Professor J. Michael Bailey do not fall under the federal definition of scientific misconduct." [...] and that the university [...] "has established a protocol to help ensure that Professor Bailey's research activities involving human subjects are conducted in accordance with the expectations of the University, the regulations and guidelines established by the federal government and with generally accepted research standards." [...] Bailey says that he did nothing wrong and that the attacks on him were motivated by the desire to suppress discussion of the book's ideas about <b>transsexualism,</b> especially autogynephilia. Alice Dreger, a bioethicist, published an account of the controversy in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. According to Dreger, the allegations of misconduct could accurately be described as [...] "harassment", and an [...] "anti-Bailey campaign". Dreger wrote that of the four women who complained to Northwestern, two acknowledged that they were aware they would be included in Bailey's book in their letter to the university. The other two were not described in the book. Dreger also reported that while there was no definitive evidence to refute the allegation of sexual misconduct, datestamps on e-mails between Bailey and his ex-wife indicated that he was at her home looking after their two children at the time the misconduct was said to have occurred. The journal published in the same issue 23 commentaries regarding multiple aspects of the controversy, including criticism of Dreger's analysis.|$|E
