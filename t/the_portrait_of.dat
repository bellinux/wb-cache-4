5|$|A Chera coin with <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> a king {{wearing a}} Roman helmet was {{discovered}} from Karur. The obverse {{side of the}} silver coin has <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through the head of <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E

50|$|When all of {{this may}} be true, even so, Henry Raeburn left us with some {{astonishing}} portraits: <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> Baroness Cécile Van Houtte and of Monsieur André Pirmez, <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> Richard Durand Trotter and of Dr. James Charles Thomson and <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Andrew Rae Gilchrist and of Kevin Connolly are fine examples of his post-war production.|$|R

5|$|The film {{plays out}} with a {{recapitulation}} of a mock Kazakhstan national anthem glorifying the country's potassium resources and its prostitutes as being the second cleanest in the region.

5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|In 751 Ruler Z {{erected a}} stela {{that was never}} finished, paired with another with <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> a queen. A hieroglyphic {{stairway}} mentions someone called B'olon K'awiil {{at about the same}} time. B'olon K'awiil was king by 771 when he raised two stelae and he was mentioned at Toniná in 789. Sites to the north of Calakmul showed a reduction in its influence at this time, with new architectural styles influenced by sites further north in the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman {{were the}} leading {{portrait}} {{artists of the}} first half of the century. John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720. His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary, which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank (1749), who was chief cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig, but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland Dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.|$|E
