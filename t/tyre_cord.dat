40|$|Two {{factors are}} driving {{advances}} in synthetic fibre yarns, cords and rope technology. The {{first is the}} development and exploration of first and second generation synthetic fibres {{and the introduction of}} new rope constructions that offer the potential for major improvements in rope properties. The second is the growing range of synthetic fibre engineering applications being studied. A number of major ventures have already been brought to realisation. For example, the US Navy interest in mooring a large “air-base ” in deep water in the Pacific and the exploitation of oil fields in greater water depths (500 – 3000 m) makes light weight fibre ropes an attractive practical alternative to wire ropes or chains. Fibre structures are also replacing steel wire structures in some other traditional uses and have the potential for important advances in <b>tyre</b> <b>cords,</b> medical ligaments, bridges, textile architectural buildings, towed arrays, space structures and other engineering applications. Polymeric fibres have complex mechanical properties and fibre structures can be geometrically complex involving interactions between millions of fine fibres.

His repertory largely consisted of well-known Irish songs from traditional sources and light contemporary ballads, and this regard resembled much of the recorded repertoire of John McCormack.

40|$|A {{series of}} viscose fibres from the <b>tyre</b> <b>cord</b> type varying in {{mechanical}} parameters and titre were compounded with polypropylene to produce fibre reinforced composites. Single fibre strength is analysed in detail and conclusions are drawn {{with respect to}} effective strength values in composite applications. Composites were analysed in terms of tensile and impact properties. Correlations between single fibre and composite properties are studied. High fibre elongation leads to favourable composite impact properties via high composite elongations at break. Using water as a plastisizing agent increasing fibre elongation, notched Charpy impact strength can be improved by more than 50 %. Using a modified rule of mixtures and a shear lag model for the composite modulus it was shown how a titre reduction improves the composite stiffness by an increased interfacial area. A direct fibre-composite strength correlation was not found...|$|E

40|$|Spun {{cellulose}} fibres {{from the}} viscose, lyocell and carbamate processes {{have been used}} to reinforce thermoplastic commodity polymers, such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and (high impact) polystyrene (HIPS) as well as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) for injection moulding applications. A specially developed double pultrusion technique has been employed for compounding. Fibres were analysed in single fibre tensile tests. Strength, stiffness, impact strength, and heat distortion temperature (HDT) were determined for injection-moulded standard test specimen and structural features were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. A strong reinforcing effect was observed in all cases. In particular, high tenacity <b>tyre</b> <b>cord</b> rayon gives excellent composite strength and impact strength, often doubling or tripling the pristine matrix values. In the case of PP, Lyocell type fibres provide enhanced stiffness and HDT, and thus the combination of both fibre types leads to a balanced composite property profile. The PE case is very similar to PP. For HIPS mainly strength and stiffness is increased, while for TPE the property profile is changed completely. With PLA, a biogenic and biodegradable composite with excellent mechanical properties is presented...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of <b>tyre</b> <b>cord</b> has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|E
