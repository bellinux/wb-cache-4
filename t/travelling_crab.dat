50|$|Eventually, {{the army}} breaks {{up and the}} {{individual}} <b>crabs</b> <b>travel</b> up the shore, and dig themselves into the sand in a unique corkscrew motion. The crabs dig down with the legs {{on one side of}} their bodies, while the legs on the other side walk backwards. They then leave this burrow, and dig another. During this period, encounters between adult males result in both males adopting the threat display (rearing up onto the last one of two pairs of legs, and stretching the other limbs out as wide as possible), after which the loser - generally the smaller crab - backs down. Eventually, the crabs remain in one of the burrows and await the next falling tide.|$|R
40|$|Arthropods possess {{spectacular}} {{diversity in}} locomotor design. Yet {{it is not}} clear what unique constraints, if any, variation in design imposes on mechanics, metabolic energy cost or endurance during terrestrial locomotion. In the present study metabolic energy cost and endurance on a treadmill are measured for an arthropod, the eight-legged sideways <b>travelling</b> ghost <b>crab,</b> Ocypode quadrata (Fabricius). In a second paper the mechanics of locomotion are determined during walking and running over a force plate. Severe limitations in O 2 uptake during exercise are not inherent in the design of a crab's O 2 transport system, which consists of gills and an open circulatory system. The ghost crab's capacity to elevate oxygen consumption (VOz) rapidly is correlated with a lesser dependence on anaerobic sources than observed in other crab species. Accelerated glycolysis contributed at the onset of submaximal exercise, before O 2 uptake adjustments were completed, but played only a minor role during steady-state exercise. O. quadrata elevated VOz 6 * 4 - to 8 -fold above resting rates. The ghost crab's maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 mlx) was not different from that of a...|$|R

For this reason the timings of astronomical events such as supernovae are usually recorded in terms of when the light from the event reached Earth, as the [...] "real time" [...] that the event occurred depends on the rest frame chosen. For example, in the rest frame of a neutrino particle <b>travelling</b> from the <b>Crab</b> Nebula supernova to Earth the supernova occurred in the 11th Century AD only a short while before the light reached Earth, but in Earth's rest frame the event occurred about 6300 years earlier.|$|R

25|$|Migration and {{reproduction}} patterns differ between crab populations along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. A distinct and large scale migration occurs in Chesapeake Bay, where C.sapidus undergoes a seasonal migration {{of up to}} several hundred miles. In {{the middle and upper}} parts of the bay, mating peaks in mid to late summer, while in the lower bay there are peaks in mating activity during spring and late summer through early fall. Changes in salinity and temperature may impact time of mating because both factors are important during the molting process. After mating, the female <b>crab</b> <b>travels</b> to the southern portion of the Chesapeake, using ebb tides to migrate from areas of low salinity to areas of high salinity, fertilizing her eggs with sperm stored during her single mating months or almost a year before.|$|R
40|$|Many mobile animals migrate {{because of}} the {{different}} benefits provided by different localities in time and space. For hermit crabs, such benefits include resource (shell, water, food) acquisition and gamete release. One of the more successful crustacean land-invaders, Coenobita hermit crabs, undertake complex short-range migrations in SW Madagascar. Number of active hermit crabs was inversely related to wind strength and positively related to tidal range, emphasising that movement would conserve water. A circadian component was also recorded in the locomotory activity of Coenobita pseudorugosus and C. rugosus. Path linearity varied {{with many of the}} same parameters, but also with beach slope. Movement was primarily perpendicular to shore in small individuals, but the parallel proportion increased with hermit crab size and tidal range, probably driven mostly by shell and food searching. Despite the costs of movement and shell carriage in the terrestrial environment, C. pseudorugosus and C. rugosus were as fast as their marine counterparts. Their speeds varied principally with individual size and were approximately 20 % faster without shells and about 20 % slower when climbing up a 20 ° slope, compared to horizontal or downhill <b>travel.</b> Hermit <b>crabs,</b> which are highly numerous and speciose in SW Madagascar, do not seem to partition niches by differential movement patterns. Aside from provision of shells in middens and capturing large adults for bait or pets, human activity may {{have a profound effect on}} hermit crab movement: observations at rare uninhabited marine reserves like Nosy Ve show that considerable diurnal activity may take place despite the apparent hostility of the environment to an essentially marine animal...|$|R
40|$|Coenobita compressus (H. Milne Edwards) walk {{forward on}} six legs using an {{alternating}} tripod gait {{similar to that}} of insects. The first walking leg provides the driving force for locomotion aided secondarily by the second walking leg, while the chelipeds act largely as supports. The left appendages are longer and heavier than the right, and they extend further laterally from the midline during their stride, thus compensating for the asymmetry of the crab which has a dextrally coiled shell and an abdomen displaced to the right. The abdomen is normally carried off the ground, but it is dragged when the shell is large. Bilateral leg autotomy alters gait patterns; usually a diagonal quadrupedal gait was adopted. Walking was poor in crabs without chelae (Li and Ri) because of problems of balance. Crabs without their first walking legs (L 2 and R 2) were the most accomplished amputee walkers. Crabs lacking legs L 3 and R 3 showed the most gait diversity. Velocity of travel is a function of crab size and the substrate walked upon. Large <b>crabs</b> <b>travel</b> faster than small ones on the beach by increasing their stride length rather than stepping frequency. Studies on a miniature treadmill showed individual crabs change velocity by changing both stepping frequency and stride length. Snail shells of the genus Nerita are carried; they are the lightest shells on the beach. Shell mass for an individual may vary three-fold, but usually the masses of the shell and crab are similar. Crabs running with and without shells have the same step frequency and stride length...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at {{the wheels of the}} crane is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric overhead travelling crane (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and wheel spacing of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure as well as to measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the crane wheels are measured through strain gauges on the end carriage load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, longitudinal crane travel with payload and lateral <b>crab</b> <b>travel</b> with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a longitudinal drive mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric overhead travelling crane and its supporting structure...|$|R
