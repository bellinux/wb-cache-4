2500|$|To {{receive a}} radio signal, a {{suitable}} antenna is required. [...] The {{output of the}} antenna may be very small, often only a few microvolts. The signal from the antenna is tuned and may be amplified in a so-called radio frequency (RF) amplifier, although this stage is often omitted. One or more tuned circuits at this stage block frequencies that are {{far removed from the}} intended reception frequency. In order to tune the receiver to a particular station, the frequency of the local oscillator is controlled by the <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> (for instance). Tuning of the local oscillator and the RF stage may use a variable capacitor, or varicap diode. The tuning of one (or more) tuned circuits in the RF stage must track the tuning of the local oscillator.|$|E
5000|$|Planetary {{reduction}} drives {{are typically}} attached between {{the shaft of}} the variable capacitor and the <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> of any radio, to allow fine adjustments of the tuning capacitor with smooth movements of the knob. Planetary drives are used in this situation to avoid [...] "backlash", which makes tuning easier. If the capacitor drive has backlash, when one attempts to tune in a station, the <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> will feel sloppy {{and it will be}} hard to perform small adjustments. Gear-drives can be made to have no backlash by using split gears and spring tension but the shaft bearings have to be very precise.|$|E
50|$|Bandspread {{controls}} {{were found on}} communications receivers, amateur radio receivers, and some broadcast receivers. With the advent of digital frequency synthesizers that could be set with high resolution by a keypad or incremental <b>tuning</b> <b>knob,</b> the requirement for bandspread control in many applications was eliminated.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{traditional}} RF circuits are static or minimally tunable using some digital controllability. For example, high power, low power and shut down modes are available in some commercially available transceivers. If available, the <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> affect different specifications in an interdependent manner. This {{is not enough for}} optimal operation of complete self-aware self-adaptive systems. Independent or orthogonal tunability of the important conflicting specifications using built-in <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> allow optimal adaptation of the wireless systems. In this paper we demonstrate the design and benefits of orthogonal <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> using an inductorless LNA as a test vehicle. The design of an orthogonally tunable LNA is discussed that has a 14 dB Gain and 30 dB OIP 3 tuning range as its power consumption goes down by 20 ×. Measurement results on this LNA validate the concept of orthogonal tunability. Use of this orthogonally tunable LNA within an adaptive wireless receiver framework shows an extra 22. 35 % system power savings compared to a traditional non-orthogonal case. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In the mid 1960s, some British {{portable}} radios had a separate 'Bandspread' waveband covering the highest frequencies {{of the medium}} wave (AM) band (typically 1400 - 1600kHz) to simplify tuning of popular commercial stations such as the offshore Radio Caroline and the continental Radio Luxembourg. A single <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> was used for all wavebands.|$|E
50|$|Body {{capacitance}} was {{a significant}} nuisance when tuning the earliest radios; touching a <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> would couple the body capacitance into the tuning circuit, slightly changing its resonant frequency. However, body capacitance is very useful in the Theremin, a musical instrument in which it causes slight frequency shifts of the instrument's internal oscillators. One of them changes pitch, and the other causes loudness (volume) to change smoothly between silence and full amount.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Eventually-consistent {{key-value}} storage systems {{sacrifice the}} ACID semantics of conventional databases to achieve superior latency and availability. However, {{this means that}} client applications, and hence end-users, can be exposed to stale data. The degree of staleness observed depends on various <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> set by application developers (customers of key-value stores) and system administrators (providers of key-value stores). Both parties must be cognizant of how these <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> affect the consistency observed by client applications {{in the interest of}} both providing the best end-user experience and maximizing revenues for storage providers. Quantifying consistency in a meaningful way is a critical step toward both understanding what clients actually observe, and supporting consistency-aware service level agreements (SLAs) in next generation storage systems. This paper proposes a novel consistency metric called Γ (Gamma) that captures client-observed consistency. This metric provides quantitative answers to questions regarding observed consistency anomalies, such as how often they occur and how bad they are when they do occur. We argue that Γ is more useful and accurate than existing metrics. We also apply Γ to benchmark the popular Cassandra key-value store. Our experiments demonstrate that Γ is sensitive to both the workload and client-level <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs,</b> and is preferable to existing techniques which focus on worst-case behavior. I...|$|R

5000|$|Each RF stage {{had to be}} {{tuned to}} the same frequency, so the {{capacitors}} had to be tuned in tandem when bringing in a new station. In some later sets the capacitors were [...] "ganged", mounted on the same shaft or otherwise linked mechanically so that the radio could be tuned with a single knob, but in most sets the resonant frequencies of the tuned circuits could not be made to [...] "track" [...] well enough to allow this, and each stage had its own <b>tuning</b> <b>knob.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} [...] "magic-eye" [...] tubes in radio sets {{is to help}} with {{accurate}} tuning to a station; the tube makes peaks in signal strength more obvious by producing a visual indication, which is better than using the ear alone. The eye is especially useful because the automatic gain control (AGC) action tends to increase the audio volume of a mistuned station, so the volume varies relatively little as the <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> is turned. The tuning eye was driven by the AGC voltage rather than the audio signal.|$|E

50|$|Early TRF sets had {{typically}} two {{or three}} <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> and tube filament voltage-control rheostats, all of {{which had to be}} set correctly to receive a station. Later (late 1920s) TRF sets had ganged <b>tuning</b> (one <b>knob</b> was used to control all stage tuning capacitors simultaneously), AC house current operation, and eliminated the filament voltage adjustments. All of these changes greatly simplified operation and made radio a household appliance that even a small child could operate, instead of the highly skilled hobbyists of the brief preceding generation. Reaction sets also had the filament adjustment rheostats for each valve, and again settings had to be right to achieve reception.|$|R

5000|$|Tuning: To {{select a}} {{particular}} station the radio is [...] "tuned" [...] {{to the frequency}} of the desired transmitter. The radio has a dial or digital display showing the frequency it is tuned to. Tuning is adjusting {{the frequency of the}} receiver's passband to the frequency of the desired radio transmitter. Turning the <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> changes the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit. When the resonant frequency is equal to the radio transmitter's frequency the tuned circuit oscillates in sympathy, passing the signal on {{to the rest of the}} receiver.|$|E

Most manufacturers claim the signal transmits over a range of 150 to 300 feet. Many wireless speakers feature variable transmission channels that can be set using a <b>tuning</b> <b>knob</b> to overcome potential RF interference with other nearby wireless devices such as cordless phones or baby monitors. Bluetooth devices use a radio communications system and therefore {{do not have to be}} in a visual line of sight with each other.|$|E

50|$|Although most early radio {{receivers}} used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's David Sarnoff, who {{he had known}} since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public. (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the Lévy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple <b>tuning</b> <b>knobs</b> and used nine vacuum-tubes. However, in conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the U.S. market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other U.S. manufacturing companies until 1930.|$|R
