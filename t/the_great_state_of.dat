[...] This public remark got national press coverage, and was even aired on the CBS Evening News. [...] The governor's remarks also created a demand for Oregon ungreeting cards, which were popular for many years. [...] The most famous ungreeting card read: [...] "Governor Tom Lawson McCall, {{on behalf of the}} citizens of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Oregon, cordially invites you to visit ...Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, or Afghanistan…" [...] The sale of bumper stickers with phrases like [...] "Don't Californicate Oregon" [...] also became popular across the state in the 1970s. [...] The governor's [...] "come visit, but don't stay" [...] remark as well as the ungreeting cards and bumper stickers articulated the values of the James G. Blaine Society.|$|E
60|$|Whenever {{the anniversary}} of the Mayflower comes round, there is a chorus of Anglo-American {{congratulation}} and comradeship, as if this at least were a matter on which all can agree. But I knew enough about America, even before I went there, to know that there are a good many people there at any rate who do not agree with it. Long ago I wrote a protest in which I asked why Englishmen had forgotten <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Virginia, the first in foundation and long the first in leadership; and why a few crabbed Nonconformists {{should have the right to}} erase a record that begins with Raleigh and ends with Lee, and incidentally includes Washington. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Virginia was the backbone of America until it was broken in the Civil War. From Virginia came the first great Presidents and most of the Fathers of the Republic. Its adherence to the Southern side in the war made it a great war, and for a long time a doubtful war. And in the leader of the Southern armies it produced what is perhaps the one modern figure that may come to shine like St. Louis in the lost battle, or Hector dying before holy Troy.|$|E

All that was now necessary was to turn the Territory into a State. He did it without any difficulty. That undeveloped country and that sparse population were not well fitted for the heavy burden of a State Government, but no matter, the people were willing to have the change, and so the Governor's game was made.|$|E

60|$|The {{citizens}} of the United States of America are not without their experience in this matter. The crisis of the national history of the American community, the war between Union and Secession, was essentially a crisis between <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the new age and the local feeling of an earlier period. But Union triumphed. Americans live now in a generation that has almost forgotten that there once seemed a possibility that the map of North America might be broken up at last into as many communities as the map of Europe.

60|$|I {{mention this}} {{peaceful}} spot with all possible laud, {{for it is}} in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> New York, that population, manners, and customs remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes {{in other parts of}} this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still water which border a rapid stream where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.|$|E

6000|$|The empty {{building}} {{which was}} thus appropriated {{to the use}} of the Indians was quite a century old, having been erected by my ancestor, Herman Mordaunt, as the original farm-house on his own particular farm. For a long time it had been used in its original character; and when it was found convenient to erect another, in a more eligible spot, and of more convenient form, this old structure had been preserved as a relic, and from year to year its removal had been talked of, but not effected. It remained, therefore, for me to decide on its fate, unless, indeed, the [...] "spirit of the institutions" [...] should happen to get hold of it, and take its control out of my hands, along with that of the rest of my property, by way of demonstrating to mankind how thoroughly <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> New York is imbued with a love of rational liberty! ...|$|E

It {{was easy to see}} by the newspapers that if ever they had known what it was to bear a good name, that time had gone by. It was plain that in these latter years they had become familiar with all manner of shameful crimes. But at the very moment that I was exalting my advantage and joying in it in secret, there was a muddy undercurrent of discomfort [...] "riling" [...] the deeps of my happiness, and that was--the having to hear my name bandied about in familiar connection with those of such people. I grew more and more disturbed. Finally I wrote my grandmother about it. Her answer came quick and sharp. She said: ...|$|E
60|$|When the Constitution {{came to be}} written, a man {{had arisen}} in the States who was peculiarly suited for the work in hand: {{he was one of}} those men to whom the world owes much, and of whom the world in general knows but little. This was Alexander Hamilton, who alone on the part of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> New York signed the Constitution of the United States. The other States sent two, three, four, or more delegates; New York sent Hamilton alone; but in sending him New York sent more to the Constitution than all the other States together. I should be hardly saying too much for Hamilton if I were to declare that all those parts of the Constitution emanated from him in which {{permanent}} political strength has abided. And yet his name has not been spread abroad widely in men's mouths. Of Jefferson, Franklin, and Madison we have all heard; our children speak of them, and they are household words in the nursery of history. Of Hamilton, however, it may, I believe, be said that he was greater than any of those.|$|E

6000|$|Oct., Nov., and Dec., '79.--The {{points of}} St. Louis are its position, its {{absolute}} wealth, (the long accumulations {{of time and}} trade, solid riches, probably a higher average thereof than any city,) the unrivall'd amplitude of its well-laid-out environage of broad plateaus, for future expansion--and <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> which it is the head. It fuses northern and southern qualities, perhaps native and foreign ones, to perfection, rendezvous the whole stretch of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and its American electricity goes well with its German phlegm. Fourth, Fifth and Third streets are store-streets, showy, modern, metropolitan, with hurrying crowds, vehicles, horse-cars, hubbub, plenty of people, rich goods, plate-glass windows, iron fronts often five or six stories high. You can purchase anything in St. Louis (in {{most of the big}} western cities for the matter of that) just as readily and cheaply as in the Atlantic marts. Often in going about the town you see reminders of old, even decay'd civilization. The water of the west, in some places, is not good, but they make it up here by plenty of very fair wine, and inexhaustible quantities of the best beer in the world. There are immense establishments for slaughtering beef and pork--and I saw flocks of sheep, 5000 in a flock. (In Kansas City I had visited a packing establishment that kills and packs an average of 2500 hogs a day the whole year round, for export. Another in Atchison, Kansas, same extent; others nearly equal elsewhere. And just as big ones here.) ...|$|E
60|$|And {{since the}} Fabian socialists {{have created a}} {{widespread}} belief that in their projected state every man will be necessarily a public servant or a public pupil because the state {{will be the only}} employer and the only educator, it is necessary {{to point out that the}} Great State presupposes neither the one nor the other. It is a form of liberty and not a form of enslavement. We agree with the older forms of socialism in supposing an initial proprietary independence in every citizen. The citizen is a shareholder in the state. Above that and after that, he works if he chooses. But if he likes to live on his minimum and do nothing--though such a type of character is scarcely conceivable--he can. His earning is his own surplus. Above the basal economics of the Great State we assume with confidence there will be a huge surplus of free spending upon extra-collective ends. Public organisations, for example, may distribute impartially and possibly even print and make ink and paper for the newspapers in the Great State, but they will certainly not own them. Only doctrine-driven men have ever ventured to think they would. Nor will the state control writers and artists, for example, nor the stage--though it may build and own theatres--the tailor, the dressmaker, the restaurant cook, an enormous multitude of other busy workers-for-preferences. In <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> the future, as in the life of the more prosperous classes of to-day, the greater proportion of occupations and activities will be private and free.|$|E

Now, in the first place, here is a citizen who has got as much property as he wants, and who wishes to live for other purposes than to accumulate. This property is not only invested to his entire satisfaction, as regards convenience, security and returns, but also {{in a way that is}} connected with some of the best sentiments of his nature. It is property that has descended to him through ancestors for two centuries; property that is historically connected with his name--on which he was born, on which he has lived, and on which he has hoped to die; property, in a word, that is associated with all the higher feelings of humanity. Because some interloper, perhaps, who has purchased an interest in one of his farms six months before, feels an aristocratic desire not to have a landlord, and wishes to own a farm in fee, that in fact he has no other right to than he gets through his lease, the governor of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> New York throws the weight of his official position against the old hereditary owner of the soil, by solemnly suggesting, in an official document that is intended to produce an effect on public opinion, that he should sell that which he does not wish to sell, but wishes to keep, and that at a price which I conceive is much below its true pecuniary value. We have liberty with a vengeance, if these are some of its antics!" ...|$|E

6000|$|So far the {{movement}} towards a world state has lacked any driving power of passion. We have been {{passing through a}} phase of intellectual revision. The idea of a world unity and brotherhood has come back again into the world almost apologetically, deferentially, asking for the kind words of successful politicians and for a gesture of patronage from kings. Yet this demand for one world-empire of righteousness was inherent in the teachings of Buddha, it flashed {{for a little while}} behind the sword of Islam, it is the embodiment in earthly affairs of the spirit of Christ. It is a call to men for service as of right, it is not an appeal to them that they may refuse, not a voice that they may disregard. It is too great a thing to hover for long thus deferentially {{on the outskirts of the}} active world it has come to save. To-day the world state says [...] "Please listen; make way for me." [...] To-morrow it will say: [...] "Make way for me, little people." [...] The day is not remote when disregardful [...] "patriotic" [...] men hectoring in the crowd will be twisted round perforce to the light they refuse to see. First comes the idea and then slowly the full comprehension of the idea, comes realization, and with that realization will come a kindling anger at the vulgarity, the meanness, the greed and baseness and utter stupidity that refuses to attend to this clear voice, this definite demand of our racial necessity. To-day we teach, but as understanding grows we must begin to act. We must put ourselves and our rulers and our fellow men on trial. We must ask: [...] "What have you done, what are you doing to help or hinder the peace and order of mankind?" [...] A time will come when a politician who has wilfully made war and promoted international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the noose than a private homicide. It is not reasonable that those who gamble with men's lives should not stake their own. The service of the world state calls for much more than passive resistance to belligerent authorities, for much more than exemplary martyrdoms. It calls for the greater effort of active interference with mischievous men. [...] "I will believe in the League of Nations," [...] one man has written, [...] "when men will fight for it." [...] For this League of Nations at Geneva, this little corner of Balfourian jobs and gentility, no man would dream of fighting, but for <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> mankind, men will presently be very ready to fight and, as the thing may go, either to kill or die. Things must come in their order; first the idea, then the kindling of imaginations, then the world wide battle. We who live in the bleak days after a great crisis, need be no more discouraged by the apparent indifference of the present time than are fields that are ploughed and sown by the wet days of February and the cold indifference of the winds of early March. The ploughing has been done, and the seed is in the ground, and the world state stirs in a multitude of germinating minds.|$|E
