5|$|In March 1975, Rowland {{was raised}} to air marshal and took over from Air Marshal Charles Read as CAS, {{becoming}} the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World WarII. He {{was also the first}} engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the Defence Secretary, Sir Arthur Tange. The CAS was nevertheless required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the General Duties Branch was removed.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens.

5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{is one of the}} New World warblers or wood-warblers in {{the family}} Parulidae. This species was {{originally}} placed under the genus Dendroica.

5|$|The phylogenetic {{position}} of Diptera has been controversial.
