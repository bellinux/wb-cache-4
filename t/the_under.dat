5|$|A {{survey of}} citizens' attitudes {{conducted}} in May 2006 included two {{questions on the}} issue of the Parliament's seat. On average, 32% people from all member states supported the two-location policy while 68 were against. Support for one location was higher among men than women, and among people over 35 than under. Support for both locations was one percentage point lower in the 10 countries which joined in 2004 than in the 15 earlier members; No group have more than 40 percent support to two locations. Of those against two seats, 76% supported Brussels and 24% supported Strasbourg. In this case support for Brussels was 6 percentage points higher in the 10 new members with women and <b>the</b> <b>under</b> 35 year-olds. The group with the highest support for Strasbourg was the over 35-year-olds with 28 percent support. The citizens of Strasbourg are of course strong supporter's of the Parliament being based in Strasbourg with each session being worth four million euro to the city's economy. In September 2008, Strasbourg's government passed a motion demanding all of Parliament's activities be relocated to the city.|$|E

6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> LAW, OR <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of <b>the</b> law are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse; for mark, they that are <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace are not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} clarify the water-accumulation {{phenomena}} in an operating polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), the water distribution in a small fuel cell was measured in the through-plane direction by using neutron radiography.

The experimental results were compared with numerical results. The water accumulation in <b>the</b> GDL <b>under</b> <b>the</b> lands was larger than that <b>under</b> <b>the</b> channels {{during the period of}} early PEFC operation. The difference of the water accumulation in <b>the</b> GDL <b>under</b> <b>the</b> land and channel was related to the water vapor. Because of the land, the vapor fraction in <b>the</b> GDL <b>under</b> <b>the</b> land was also higher than that <b>under</b> <b>the</b> channel.
