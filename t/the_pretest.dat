30|$|In <b>the</b> <b>pretests,</b> all of <b>the</b> {{participants}} presented well-established construction responding {{from the}} beginning of the study and had practically 100 % correct responses for printed sentences for auditory (AE) and visual (BE) samples. High variability in performance among the participants was found in the MTS procedure. Tasks that required auditory conditional control produced more correct selections of printed sentences (AC) compared with pictures of scenes (AB). All of the participants, except LET, gradually increased their number of correct responses when matching printed sentences to dictated sentences (AC), obtaining 100 % correct responses in <b>the</b> last <b>pretest.</b> LET improved performance from 0 % correct in the first test to 66 % correct in <b>the</b> following <b>pretests.</b> In tasks that required matching pictures to dictated sentences (AB), the participants presented variable performance in <b>the</b> <b>pretests,</b> and all of them concluded <b>the</b> last <b>pretest</b> with 33.3 % correct responses. Variability was also verified for the CB relation, and the participants’ percentage of correct responses was between 0 and 66.67 % when matching pictures to printed sentences, with more likely performance of 33.33 %.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} exclude random factors from the experiment, several {{measures}} {{were conducted to}} minimize unintentional and external influences. First, student’s prior level of English learning achievement was measured as the average score of three <b>pretests,</b> while <b>the</b> interval of these pretests was 1 month. In <b>the</b> <b>pretests,</b> students had no idea about the eSchoolbag, and the eSchoolbag haven’t {{been used in the}} classroom practice. In doing so, a relatively correct estimate of students’ prior English-learning levels were acquired. Second, this study was designed as a longitudinal research that involves repeated observations of students’ learning outcomes to ensure that the differences observed were more accurate. Third, similar with the design of <b>the</b> <b>pretests,</b> students’ learning achievement were tested for three times with an interval of 1 month after using eSchoolbag for 9  months. Last, it’s important to mention that the English exams taken in <b>the</b> <b>pretests</b> and posttests were designed by school English-teaching teams as standardized tests, whose validity can be verified to some extent.|$|R

50|$|One way to {{minimize}} the influence of artifacts {{is to use a}} pretest-posttest control group design. Within this design, “groups of people who are initially equivalent (at <b>the</b> <b>pretest</b> phase) are randomly assigned to receive the experimental treatment or a control condition and then assessed again after this differential experience (posttest phase)”. Thus, any effects of artifacts are (ideally) equally distributed in participants in both the treatment and control condition.|$|E

30|$|Thirty-six {{male and}} female {{participants}} with at least 2  years of experience in resistance training were recruited from the German Sport University Cologne. The participants were randomized into two training groups: vibration training group (VG) and traditional training group (TTG). Both groups underwent a 4 -week training phase, where each participant worked out at 70  % of the individual 1 repeat maximum (RM—maximum load capacity of a muscle for one lift to fatigue) (4 sets with 12 repetitions each). For participants in the VG group, local vibration was additionally applied directly to hamstring muscles during exercise.

50|$|In {{asymptomatic}} patients {{where there}} is a very low clinical suspicion for splenomegaly, physical examination alone is unlikely to rule-in splenomegaly due to the inadequate sensitivity of the examination. Similar to many other findings in medicine, Castell's sign must be combined with clinical findings to rule in splenomegaly. To achieve a positive predictive value over 90%, <b>the</b> <b>pretest</b> probability must be 70%. Grover et al., recommends a greater than 10% preexamination clinical suspicion of splenic enlargement to effectively rule in the diagnosis of splenomegaly with physical exam. However, a 10% pretest probability only yields a positive predictive value of 35%.|$|E

Kelly [...] used AGA in a curriculum study. In a curriculum development project called “Justice and the City,” to evaluate whether the concept of justice is learnt by students from the curriculum project, 41 themes grouped into four basic domains (Basic Values, Means/End, Analytical Units, and Political-Economic Orientation domains) were given to students. A content analysis of {{the responses to the}} stimulus word “justice,” revealed that the meaning of justice was substantially changed in the experiment. Students in all urban affairs/public policy classes listed specific kinds of justice (e.g., religious, corporate, natural, liberal, Marxist) and public policy issues in the cards while these responses did not appear in <b>the</b> <b>pretest.</b>|$|E

50|$|D.B. Wolf and N. Abell {{conducted}} a study to distinguish the effect of chanting the maha-mantra on stress, depression and the three gunas-sattva ("enlightenment"), rajas ("passion"), and tamas ("inertia"). They used the Vedic Personality Inventory (VPI) for measuring three gunas-sattva, the Generalized Contentment Scale (GCS) which scaling the magnitude of nonpsychotic depression and the Index of Clinical Stress (ICS). They hypothesized that singing the real mantra {{will lead to a}} reduction in stress, depression and inertia levels, and will increase enlightenment and passion compared to the placebo group (with a set of mantra-like sentences) and control group. Each of these groups was pretested and post-tested and was examined in follow-up stage. The entire study was completed in 61 subjects, 23 of them participated in Mantra`s group, 19 were on placebo and 19 in control group. 31 subjects female and 30 male respectively. After <b>the</b> <b>pretest,</b> members of Mantra and Placebo groups were instructed how to chant mantras for 28 days. They had to read the mantra 3 times per day, about 20-25 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Life-review therapy using Autobiographical Retrieval Practice {{for older}} adults with {{depressive}} symptoms, in a study carried out by Serrano JP, Latorre JM, Gatz M, and Montanes J, Department of psychology at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, demonstrated that, with increased specificity of memories, individuals show decreased depression and hopelessness and increased life satisfaction. The test was designed to measure participants’ ability to recall a specific memory, {{in response to a}} cue word, while being timed.Thirty cue words; including five words classified as 'positive' (e.g., funny, lucky, passionate, happy, hopeful), five as 'negative' (unsuccessful, unhappy, sad, abandoned, gloomy), and five as 'neutral' (work, city, home, shoes, family); were presented orally in a fixed, alternating order to each member of a focus group. To ensure that the participants understood the instructions, examples were provided of both 'general' memories (e.g., summers in the city) and 'specific' memories (e.g., the day I got married). For each cue word, participants were asked to share a memory evoked by that word, of an event that should have occurred only once, at a particular time and place, and that lasted no longer than a day. If the person could not recall a memory within 30 seconds, then that cue instance was not counted. Two psychologists served as raters and independently scored the responses of each participant. Each memory was tagged either as 'specific' - if the recalled event lasted no more than one day - or, otherwise, as 'general'. The raters were not informed regarding the hypotheses of the study, the experimental (control) group's membership, nor the content of <b>the</b> <b>pretest</b> or post-test.|$|E
30|$|We {{conducted}} {{multiple regression}} analysis to estimate {{the potential impact of}} using the practice system on four performance measures that we mentioned in the “Performance measures” section.

For the regressions that were fitted for learning gains, we could not directly use <b>the</b> <b>pretest</b> score as a control variable, because learning gain was derived from <b>the</b> <b>pretest</b> score itself.
