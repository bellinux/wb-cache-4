50|$|Since {{keeping the}} prayers (salat) {{is one of}} the tenets of Islam, Muslims need to have mosques {{in order to keep the}} weekly (Juma) prayer.

As a result, in 1289, they built a small mosque for their household needs and the mosque, most probably, is named after the householder’s name Ahmed Al-Aga. This is the first mosque in Kosovo at least 100 years before the Ottoman arrival in Kosovo and the well-known battle of Kosovo in 1389.|$|R

25|$|Further inroads {{came with}} the {{founding}} of a new school for the training of Western style music instructors in 1924, renaming the Istanbul Oriental Music School as the Istanbul Conservatory in 1926, and sending talented young musicians abroad for further music education. These students include well-known Turkish composers such as Cemal Reşit Rey, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Ahmet Adnan Saygun, Necil Kazım Akses and Hasan Ferit Alnar, who {{became known as the}} Turkish Five. The founding of the Ankara State Conservatory with the aid of the German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith in 1936 showed that Turkey in terms of music wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> West.|$|E

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idealised figure of her own father and tried, as best she could, to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E

500|$|The Egyptians {{distinguished}} nṯrw, [...] "gods", from rmṯ, [...] "people", but {{the meanings}} of the Egyptian and the English terms do not match perfectly. The term nṯr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life. Deceased humans were called nṯr because they were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> gods, whereas the term was rarely applied to many of Egypt's lesser supernatural beings, which modern scholars often call [...] "demons". Egyptian religious art also depicts places, objects, and concepts in human form.

Built on a bouncy beat, [...] "Radio" [...] is instrumentally complete with a Roland TR-808 drum, bass instruments, and synthesizers. Several music critics, including Ben Westhoff of OC Weekly, noted that [...] "Radio" [...] bears resemblance to Rihanna's single [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007) as they are both set to 1980s-style synthesizers." [...] Similarly, James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> latest electro-pop confection from Rihanna. Darryl Sterdan of the Canadian website Jam! wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] sounds like a record Madonna would sing because of its electropop and dance-pop musical styles.|$|E

500|$|Frank Langella {{was cast}} as Louis Zabel. His death [...] "ultimately leads the {{characters}} {{to discover the}} shady practices" [...] of James's bank. Susan Sarandon portrays Sylvia Moore, Jacob's real-estate agent mother who is just as consumed by greed as Gekko is, but in a different sense. Audrey, a [...] "tough, intelligent trader in the Wall Street trenches", is portrayed by Vanessa Ferlito. John Buffalo Mailer plays Jacob's Long Island financier friend, Robby and Eli Wallach plays the part of Jules Steinhardt, a Churchill Schwartz top executive and Wall Street patriarch who considers the current economic climate <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 1929 stock market crash. Pressman deemed the actor's role as the [...] "crier of doom," [...] who, [...] "reveals just how much more devastating things can be today."

She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the family}} and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that [...] "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit [...] but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment." [...] Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé. In the episode [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time. Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Rings Around the World was the Super Furry Animals' {{first album}} for Epic Records {{following}} the demise, in 1999, {{of their previous}} label Creation {{and the success of}} 2000's Mwng, which was issued on the band's own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a [...] "laid back and sort of wiped clean" [...] record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as [...] "a very ambitious project" [...] stating that [...] "We were trying to make a blockbuster album that was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting." [...] Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was [...] "into the excess of it, that was the whole point". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E

500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|In this episode, Michael Scott {{describes}} the Dundies as [...] "like the Golden Globes but less mean" [...] referring to Ricky Gervais' hosting of the 2011 Golden Globe Awards; which left critics questioning {{if he had}} gone [...] "too far". As {{executive producer of the}} American series and creator of the original British series, Gervais stated on his blog that the line was inserted as a metajoke was intended as [...] "a little in-joke". Near the beginning of the episode, Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Michael notes that [...] "When Larry King died, they didn't just cancel his show", showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased. Later, he notes that [...] "they got Piers Morgan to come in and do his show" [...] instead. The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of [...] "Seasons of Love" [...] from the Broadway musical Rent. Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner, and never a Jedi knight, a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise. Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 1990 film The Godfather Part III, rather than the [...] "confusing" [...] 1972 film The Godfather I, which he notes had [...] "three big laughs". Additionally, the episode contains several references to the film The King's Speech, notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume.|$|E
500|$|The {{second book}} {{to use the}} name Unearthed Arcana was written by Andy Collins, Jesse Decker, David Noonan, and Rich Redman, and {{published}} in February 2004 by Wizards of the Coast, for use with the Dungeons & Dragons third edition rules. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Ed Cox, Wayne England, Emily Fiegenschuh, David Hudnut, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, John and Laura Lakey, David Martin, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Mark Nelson, James Pavelec, Steve Prescott, David Roach, Richard Sardinha, Ron Spencer, Stephen Tappin, Joel Thomas, and Ben Thompson. The designers aimed the book at experienced players and DMs looking for something new, encouraging them to customize the game's rules. The designers {{did not want the}} third edition book <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original Unearthed Arcana mechanically, because according to Andy Collins: [...] "Every book on the market looks like the original Unearthed Arcana. New classes, new spells, new magic items - that's the default [...] "recipe" [...] for a d20 product these days. We saw no need to do that with this book." [...] Where the original Unearthed Arcana had simply expanded the rules and options of the core game, this 224-page supplement was aimed at providing an extensive list of variant rules and options to change the standard game itself. The volume of options added was intentionally excessive; according to the designers, a Dungeon Master who reads the book must be prepared to [...] "Drink from the fire hose" [...] and to think before using options that may radically imbalance the game. [...] The book ends with a checklist of the included variants, preceded by a short chapter discussing ways of transitioning among multiple games using different rulesets (one of which explicitly emulates the [...] "Eternal Champion" [...] stories of Michael Moorcock).|$|E
