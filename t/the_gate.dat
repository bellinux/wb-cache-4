5|$|Alphonse {{is guided}} by the homunculus Wrath to the {{underground}} city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony, who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open <b>the</b> <b>Gate.</b> Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society {{plans to use the}} weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution, and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted {{at the same time that}} Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.|$|E

5|$|Constructed in 1476, <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Ponte is {{situated}} westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, {{built at the}} same period, leads from <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> to St. John Fortress. The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century when the sewage system was completed, and building houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed.|$|E

2500|$|According to Josephus, {{there were}} ten entrances {{into the inner}} courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women {{to the court of}} the Israelites, named <b>the</b> Nicanor <b>Gate.</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>gates</b> were: On <b>the</b> south side (going from west to east) <b>the</b> Fuel <b>Gate,</b> <b>the</b> Firstling <b>Gate,</b> <b>the</b> Water <b>Gate.</b> On <b>the</b> north side, from west to east, are <b>the</b> Jeconiah <b>Gate,</b> <b>the</b> Offering <b>Gate,</b> <b>the</b> Women's <b>Gate</b> and <b>the</b> Song <b>Gate.</b> On <b>the</b> Eastern side, <b>the</b> Nicanor <b>gate,</b> which is where most Jewish {{visitors}} entered.

5|$|Edward {{appears in}} his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend Winry Rockbell, who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris {{military}} manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers {{with the help}} of Roy Mustang. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> and killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> and follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah, intending to close <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> and destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack. They enjoy their new lives together as they leave Germany with Noah, while on the Elric brothers homeworld, their friends go back to their normal lives.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> and {{projecting}} out from <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
25|$|The bell begins ringing {{when the}} lights begin {{flashing}} and stops when <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> have completely lowered, and then resumes ringing when <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> begin to go up, until <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> have returned to their original position.|$|R
50|$|These are {{magnetic}} field generators that {{are able to}} detect metal when it passes into the field. The detector gives a signal to <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> either causing <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> to open or preventing <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> from closing.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|The Thevaphibal Gate is {{the central}} {{entrance}} to the hall, however the central doorway is reserve exclusively {{for use by the}} king, others must enter through the two other doors on either side. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> is guarded by Chinese-style statues, including mythical warriors and lions. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> is topped by three Thai-style spires covered in Chinese ceramics.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} Graham and Macdonnell {{continue}} {{to be remembered as}} an iconic moment in the battle of Waterloo. In 1915, cigarette manufacturers W.D. & H.O. Wills portrayed Graham and Macdonnell on one of the cigarette cards printed to commemorate the centenary of Waterloo. Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> and even if they include their own fictional heroes they attribute the closing of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E

5|$|The eastern gate, {{constructed}} between 1213 and 1215, is {{the only}} one that opens toward the area enclosed by the city walls of Damascus. It is located in one of the citadel's square towers and protected by another tower immediately south of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> tower and a barbacan running between these towers. It is a bent-axis gate running through vaulted passages before reaching the courtyard. Behind it is a square hall in which four columns support a central unusually shaped dome. It incorporates a gate tower from the old Seljuq citadel. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> lacks defensive structures like murder-holes and is more decorated than the northern gate, which must be related to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> faces the city. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> is decorated with a superb muqarnas canopy that is now hidden because the outer door is blocked.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gate</b> lodge, {{gates and}} gatepiers were built around 1820.|$|E
5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> was moved up, or awarded additional points for <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up the hill to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
50|$|During Numa's reign, <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of <b>the</b> Temple of Janus {{were closed}} and Rome {{remained}} at peace. The next king, Tullus Hostilius, opened <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Janus {{when he went to}} war with Alba Longa. <b>The</b> <b>Gates</b> of Janus remained open for the next 400 years until after the First Punic War when T. Manlius Torquatus closed <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Janus in 235 BC. This closure lasted about eight years. War with the Gauls in Northern Italy forced <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Janus to reopen. They did not close again until 29 BC, following the deaths of Antony and Cleopatra.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> {{were once}} opened {{only for the}} king, today they are always closed, and so <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> have in a way become a sacred space themselves, {{representative}} of the actual sacred space behind them.

25|$|In 2006, {{there was}} {{discussion}} in the MCC about possibly removing <b>the</b> Grace <b>Gates</b> {{to another part of}} Lord's.
