5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends,</b> and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E

25|$|Henry Ford, the {{automobile}} magnate, later lived {{a few hundred}} feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends</b> until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.|$|E

25|$|Frederick Eaton and William Mulholland {{were two}} {{critical}} {{actors in the}} California Water Wars. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends,</b> having worked together in the private Los Angeles Water Company in the 1880s. In 1886, Eaton became City Engineer and Mulholland became superintendent of the Water Company. In 1898, Eaton was elected mayor of Los Angeles, and was instrumental in converting the Water Company to city control in 1902. When the company became the Los Angeles Water Department, Mulholland continued to be superintendent, due to his vast knowledge of the water system.|$|E
500|$|Sean Lennon, Lennon's son, {{has gone}} on record calling the {{production}} and making of the film, including Lindsay Lohan's involvement with it, [...] "tacky."

500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends</b> and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends,</b> friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends</b> and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E

This helped get him his world recognition break when Ali agreed to a match. Joe Frazier, who'd sparred with Norton, presciently said of Ali, [...] "He'll have plenty of trouble!" [...] Though both were top boxers in the mid 1970s, Norton and Frazier never fought each other, {{in part because they}} shared the same trainer, Eddie Futch, and also that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|E

2500|$|They also {{controlled}} their club, record, radio, {{and television}} appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In Dean & Me, Lewis calls Martin {{one of the}} great comic geniuses of all time. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends,</b> as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction. He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis. Martin told his partner he was [...] "nothing to me but a dollar sign". The act broke up in 1956, 10 years to the day from the first teaming.|$|E
2500|$|O'Neill was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Reagan administration's domestic and defense policies. Following the 1980 election, with the U.S. Senate controlled by Republicans, O'Neill became {{the leader of the}} congressional opposition. O'Neill even went as far as calling Ronald Reagan [...] "the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the White House". O'Neill also said that Reagan was [...] "Herbert Hoover with a smile" [...] and [...] "a cheerleader for selfishness." [...] He also said that Reagan's policies meant that his presidency was [...] "one big Christmas party for the rich." [...] Privately, O'Neill and Reagan were always on cordial terms, or as Reagan himself put it in his memoirs, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends</b> [...] "after 6PM". O'Neill in that same memoir when questioned by Reagan regarding a personal attack against the President that made the paper, explained that [...] "before 6PM it's all politics". Reagan once compared O'Neill to the classic arcade game Pac-Man in a speech, saying that he was [...] "a round thing that gobbles up money". He also once joked he had received a valentine card from O'Neill: [...] "I knew it was from Tip, because the [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|While Hammer {{may have}} {{challenged}} and competed with Michael Jackson {{during the height}} of his career, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>friends,</b> proven by a phone call Hammer had with Jackson about his [...] "Too Legit to Quit" [...] video which he shared on The Wendy Williams Show (July 2009). Hammer wanted to ensure he was not offended by the ending of the video where a purported Michael Jackson (seen only from behind) does the [...] "2 Legit 2 Quit" [...] hand gesture with his famous glove. They also appeared together at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006, where Hammer danced in honor of The Godfather of Soul. After Jackson's death, Hammer posted his remembrance and sympathy of the superstar on Twitter. Michael's friend and fellow pop culture icon Hammer told Spinner that, [...] "now that the King of Pop has passed, it's the duty of his fans and loved ones to carry Jackson's creative torch." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Michael Jackson lit the fuse that ignited the spirit of dance in us all. He gave us a song and a sweet melody that will never die.
