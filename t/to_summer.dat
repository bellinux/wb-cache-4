5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring <b>to</b> <b>summer.</b> The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards.

The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E

The route passes Union Pond and Dicks Pond {{to the south and}} Spectacle Pond and Sandy Pond to the north before entering the town of Plymouth. In Plymouth, Route 25 passes to the north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds. While the freeway has no interchanges in Plymouth, a rest area is located off eastbound Route 25 in the town; the area is inaccessible from westbound Route 25. Due to state funding cutbacks, services at the rest area are limited <b>to</b> <b>summer</b> weekends (Friday to Sunday) as of 2010. After the rest area, Route 25 passes over Bourne Road and turns sharply to head in a southwestern direction. The route passes under Bournedale Road after entering the town of Bourne. In Bourne, Route 25 has its final interchange; Exit 3 (formerly Exit 2) serves the villages of Buzzards Bay and Sagamore, connecting to US 6 (Scenic Highway) and Route 28 north. From Exit 3, US 6 is used to access the Sagamore Bridge in northern Bourne and the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia is {{generally}} considered to be more suited <b>to</b> <b>summer</b> sport, several ice-based sports take place as well. Snow falls on the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania. The Australian Alps are within six hours' drive for residents of Sydney, but within two hours' drive for residents of Melbourne and Canberra, Tasmanian ski slopes are within a day's drive for residents of the major cities of Hobart and Launceston. However, the season is quite short, as the snow is skiable for only about four months per year. Skiing in Australia was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the goldrush town of Kiandra, New South Wales, around 1859, near today's Selwyn Snowfields ski resort. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major alpine skiing resorts include Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass in New South Wales; Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller in Victoria and Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania. Victoria has three dedicated cross-country ski resorts and extensive areas are available for cross-country skiing within national parks including Kosciuszko National Park (NSW), Alpine National Park (VIC); Namadgi National Park (ACT) and in the Tasmanian Wilderness.|$|E

5|$|Auden began {{summering}} in Europe, {{together with}} Chester Kallman, in 1948, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting in 1958, in Kirchstetten, Austria, where {{he bought a}} farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957, and, he said, shed tears of joy at owning {{a home for the}} first time. In 1956–61, Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, and <b>to</b> <b>summer</b> in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and other magazines.|$|E

The serial's creator Alan Bateman thought of the idea while observing the locals of a rural town in New South Wales opposing the idea of foster children living in the area.

5|$|However, the Germans {{were now}} {{trapped in the}} {{interior}} of Gaul, as their return route to the Rhine was barred by the Roman armies. In Julian's sector, the Caesar despatched squadrons of cavalry to lie in ambush on three roads and these successfully intercepted and destroyed the returning barbarian bands. But in Barbatio's sector, the main body of Germans were allowed to pass unmolested: Barbatio's chief-of-staff Cella rejected the urgent plea of two of his cavalry tribuni (regimental commanders) Valentinianus (later emperor Valentinian I ruled 364-75) and Bainobaudes to deploy their squadrons on a highway that they expected the enemy would use. The escaping force reached some islands in the Rhine near Strasbourg where the raiding-bands had moved their camps for safety in response to the Roman pincer movement. Nevertheless, Julian pursued them vigorously. Although without boats, his men succeeded in reaching one island, as the river had become fordable at some points due <b>to</b> <b>summer</b> drought. An entire raiding-band was surprised and slaughtered, a success repeated on a few other islands. In response, the Germans evacuated the remaining islands, removing their sutlers, baggage and booty {{to the far side of}} the Rhine.|$|E
