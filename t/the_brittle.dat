5|$|The Russulaceae are {{a diverse}} family of fungi {{in the order}} Russulales, with roughly 1,900 known species and a {{worldwide}} distribution. They comprise the brittlegills and the milk-caps, well-known mushroom-forming fungi that include some edible species. These gilled mushrooms are characterised by <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> flesh of their fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|The feature {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> fruitbody {{structure in the}} mushroom-forming species are globular cells, called sphaerocytes or sphaerocysts, that compose the flesh (trama) alongside the usual hyphae. Sometimes, these cells are clustered, and the position and arrangement of these clusters differs among genera.|$|E
5|$|The milk {{is first}} carrot-red {{and becomes a}} maroon colour within 10 to 30minutes. <b>The</b> <b>brittle</b> and pale-yellowish flesh is often infested with maggots. If cut or injured it becomes, as the milk, first carrot-red, then maroon and within hours dirty green. The fruit body smells harsh, fruit-like and first tastes mild, but then {{slightly}} resinous-bitter and nearly spicy or somewhat astringent.|$|E

5000|$|An {{extremely}} thin blade as per its namesake, meaning [...] "needle", {{it is in}} {{the possession}} of Hakuhei Sabi. It is <b>the</b> <b>brittlest</b> blade as <b>the</b> blade itself is made of glass, which gives it its light weight, but it is rather fragile if used incorrectly. The sheath and hilt are white and decorated with floral patterns.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula are valued as {{excellent}} edible mushrooms. This {{is the case}} for example for the north temperate species Lactarius deliciosus, Lactifluus volemus, or Russula vesca, and other species are popular {{in other parts of the}} world, e.g. Lactarius indigo in Mexico, or Lactifluus edulis in tropical Africa. Some species, like Russula vesca, can even be eaten raw. <b>The</b> <b>brittle</b> texture of Russula fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. <b>The</b> <b>brittle</b> titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{task of the}} metallurgists was {{to determine}} how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. <b>The</b> <b>brittle</b> α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300°C to 450°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
5|$|The Bengalee, a reformist newspaper, {{presents}} a rare {{view of the}} true victim Elokeshi being forgotten in the debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin. In the First Meeting painting, Elokeshi is sometimes depicted as a courtesan, indicating {{that she is the}} one who seduces the mahant. She is often described as unchaste and to have developed the adulterous affair and even lived with him for some time {{despite the fact that he}} first rapes her. In one play, Elokeshi's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes. The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman, question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent. The prostitutes empathise with Elokeshi, another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace, which for them illustrates <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> status of a wife. Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the mahants lust on her father's command. Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives in to her father's orders than on the depiction of rape.|$|E
25|$|Strike-slip faults {{tend to be}} {{oriented}} near vertically, {{resulting in}} an approximate width of 10nbsp&km within <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> crust, thus earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because {{many of them are}} located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> layer is only about 6nbsp&km.|$|E

50|$|Brittle stars live {{in areas}} from the low-tide level downwards. Six {{families}} live at least 2 m deep; the genera Ophiura, Amphiophiura, and Ophiacantha range below 4 m. Shallow species live among sponges, stones, or coral, {{or under the}} sand or mud, with only their arms protruding. Two of the best-known shallow species are <b>the</b> green <b>brittle</b> star (Ophioderma brevispina), found from Massachusetts to Brazil, and <b>the</b> common European <b>brittle</b> star (Ophiothrix fragilis). Deep-water species tend to live in or on the sea floor or adhere to coral or urchins. The most widespread species is <b>the</b> long-armed <b>brittle</b> star (Amphipholis squamata), a grayish or bluish, strongly luminescent species.|$|R

25|$|Crabs are {{arthropods}} whose carapace {{is made of}} a mineralized hard component (which exhibits brittle fracture) and {{a softer}} organic component composed primarily of chitin. <b>The</b> <b>brittle</b> component is arranged in a helical pattern. Each of these mineral ‘rods’ (1 μm diameter) contains chitin–protein fibrils with approximately 60nm diameter. These fibrils are made of 3nm diameter canals which link the interior and exterior of the shell.|$|E

25|$|Menkes {{patients}} exhibit severe neurological abnormalities, apparently due to {{the lack}} of several copper-dependent enzymes required for brain development, including reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity. <b>The</b> <b>brittle,</b> kinky hypopigmented hair of steely appearance is due to a deficiency in an unidentified cuproenzyme. Reduced lysyl oxidase activity results in defective collagen and elastin polymerization and corresponding connective-tissue abnormalities including aortic aneurisms, loose skin, and fragile bones.|$|E
25|$|Valhalla {{consists}} of a bright central region 360km across, an inner ridge and trough zone and striking concentric rings extending up to about 1,900km from the center. Several large impact craters and catenae are superimposed on Valhalla. Valhalla multi-ring system is of impact origin and may have formed as semi-liquid or liquid material underlying <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> lithosphere punctured by the impactor slumped towards {{the center of the}} crater following the impact.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{foundation}} of the Pampas, the Sierras has been involved in a series of extensional events in the Late Paleozoic (Gondwanan cycle), the latter accompanied by a large magmatism, volcanism, and finally the Cenozoic Andean orongenic cycle, which produced the present morphology. <b>The</b> <b>brittle</b> tectonic Andica is represented by reverse faults among which stand out in the hills of Cordoba those high peaks, the Giants, Copina and Cumbrecita.|$|E

25|$|Traditional jian blades {{are usually}} of sanmei (three plate) construction, which {{involved}} sandwiching {{a core of}} hard steel between two plates of softer steel. The central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces, allowing for a sharp edge, while the softer spine protects <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> core. Some blades had wumei or five plate construction, with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge. Bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner: in this case an alloy with a high copper content {{would be used to}} make a resilient core and spine, while the edge would be made from a high-tin-content alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade.|$|E
25|$|A {{large-scale}} Capitol dome restoration project, {{the first}} extensive such work since 1959–1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration. As of 2012, $20 million in {{work around the}} skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in <b>the</b> <b>brittle</b> iron {{that have led to}} rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair the exterior of the dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations, but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014. Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome. All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.|$|E
