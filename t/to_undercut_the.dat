5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> <b>the</b> NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{addition}} {{has been}} implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2001), showing that both Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events may show hysteresis behaviour. This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas, {{such as a}} 0.15 Sv increase or 0.03 Sv decrease, would suffice to cause profound shifts in global circulation (Rahmstorf et al. 2005). The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south, mostly in the subtropical Atlantic, a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data. This idea was connected to D-O events by Maslin et al. (2001). They suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, and cause melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce {{the strength of the}} North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern-hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving northern hemisphere melting and another D-O cold event. Eventually, the accumulation of melting reaches a threshold, whereby it raises sea level enough <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> <b>the</b> Laurentide ice sheet, thereby causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September1 and continued westward until reaching the eastern Pacific fifteen days later. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed along the wave axis on September16 as convective activity organized, and by 0600UTC on September18, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Convective bands began to form {{near the center}} a few hours later, leading to an improved satellite presentation overall. Tracking west-northwestward {{as a result of the}} mid-level ridge, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000UTC on September19. Turning northwest, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite, prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category1 hurricane 24 hours later. With an area of deep convection near the center, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mb (hPa; 29.06inHg) at 0000UTC on September21. Westerly flow associated with a large upper-level low began <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> <b>the</b> outflow of Ivo, and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours. The convective pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear, and despite a brief burst of convection, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000UTC on September 23. Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward, and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly. The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction.|$|E

5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> <b>the</b> cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

25|$|On lap 23, Räikkönen {{was drawing}} closer to Massa and the Williams team responded by {{bringing}} {{him into the}} pit lane to install soft compound tyres for a potential under cut, and rejoined in ninth behind teammate Bottas.

That same lap, Ferrari elected to bring Alonso into the pit lane for the change to super soft compound tyres. Vettel made his pit stop on lap 25 for soft compound tyres and emerged in third place behind Alonso's faster Ferrari. Massa overtook Hülkenberg on the main straight for eighth on the same lap. Hamilton made his stop from the lead for super soft compound tyres on the following lap, giving it to Ricciardo; his team {{took advantage of the}} large gap he established to remove rubber debris from his front wing.

25|$|Magnussen {{made a good}} getaway off the grid, {{moving to}} sixth, which {{involved}} passing Massa outside of track limits at the fifth corner, but later slid sideways at turn seven while fending off teammate Button which dropped him to ninth. Button made the best start in the field, gaining four positions {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Rosberg's pit lane start meant he lost 21 positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Hamilton led from Vettel, Alonso, Ricciardo, Räikkönen, Massa, Button, Bottas, Magnussen and Kvyat. Alonso's start was investigated by the stewards but elected to take no further action against the driver. Rosberg left the pit lane on the second lap but was initially unable to maintain the pace of Chilton's Marussia. DRS was enabled on the third lap as the field spread out and Magnussen was investigated by the stewards for going beyond track limits. McLaren teammates Magnussen and Button avoided colliding with each other on lap four and the result meant they fell behind both Williams cars. Vettel kept Hamilton's lead advantage constant, prompting the latter to increase his pace by going half a second faster than Vettel while conserving fuel.Rosberg overtook Chilton to move into 20th on lap five, while Kvyat was told over his radio to battle Magnussen after going three-tenths of a second faster than Magnussen in the first sector on the following lap. Rosberg was not able to overtake Ericsson and was more than 40 seconds behind race leader Hamilton by the same lap. It was announced on the seventh lap that no further action against Magnussen was necessitated. Magnussen, Kvyat and Vergne were within one second of each other and battle for ninth place. Vergne encouraged his team get teammate Kvyat to cede a position to him but Kvyat insisted he had the pace to get past Magnussen. Kvyat lost tenth place to teammate Vergne on lap eight and the latter began gaining on Magnussen. Rosberg was only able to shift gears two at any one point and was five seconds slower than teammate Hamilton. Hamilton led the field by five seconds by the start of lap ten despite having balance problems with his car over the space of one lap. Massa ran closely behind Räikkönen by the time of his first pit stop at the end of lap ten as part of a plan by the Williams team <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> <b>the</b> second Ferrari car.

500|$|In August 1943 and March 1944, the Polish Underground State {{announced}} its long-term plan, which was partly designed <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> <b>the</b> attractiveness {{of some of}} the communists' proposals. The communists, in their increasingly radical What We Fight For declarations (from March and November 1943), were proposing the creation of a heavily socialist or even communist state, denouncing capitalism, which they equated to slavery. They demanded nationalization of most if not all of the economy, introduction of central planning, The Underground State's declaration What the Polish Nation is Fighting For declared the reconstruction of Poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal, guaranteeing full equality to the minorities, as well as full freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of political activity. The plan also called {{for the creation of a}} Central European federal union, without domination by any single state. In the economic sector, planned economy would be endorsed, by embracing the socialist and Christian Democrat principles, such as income redistribution, aiming at a reduction of economic inequality. The plan promised land reform, nationalization of the industrial base, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the country's pre-1939 eastern border. According to the plan, the country's Eastern borders, as delineated by the 1921 Treaty of Riga, would be kept while in the north and west compensation would be sought from [...] German territories. Thus, the main differences between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms, which both sides advocated, but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations.

30|$|It {{was also}} {{observed}} that the landslides are concentrated at the confluence of two streams. As described in the previous section, these landslides are attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>undercutting</b> of <b>the</b> slopes associated with gullying.

Numerous ancillary factors include bedrock-loess interface, slope steepness, vegetation cover, and land utilization. As already noted, the upper surface of the Neogene bedrock is often weathered and contains variable amounts of smectites. In this zone, wetting-drying results in a progressive decrease in strength that may ultimately lead <b>to</b> slope failure. <b>Undercutting</b> of <b>the</b> slopes along the gullies is frequent, which {{increases the risk of}} slope failure.
