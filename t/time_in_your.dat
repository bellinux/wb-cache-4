500|$|After the 2001 {{inauguration of}} Harvard University's twenty-seventh president, Lawrence Summers, Lewis and Summers came into {{conflict}} over {{the direction of}} the College and its educational philosophy. Lewis, for example, emphasized the importance of extracurricular pursuits, advising incoming freshmen that [...] "flexibility in your schedule, unstructured <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> day, and evenings spent with your friends rather than your books are all, in a larger sense, essential for your education", while Summers complained of an insufficiently intellectual [...] "Camp Harvard" [...] and admonished students that [...] "You are here to work, and your business here is to learn." [...] After Lewis issued what The Harvard Crimson called [...] "a scathing indictment of the view that increasing intellectual rigor ought to be the [...] priority"pointing out that prospective employers show less interest in grades than in personal qualities built outside the classroomhe was peremptorily removed as dean in March 2003.|$|E
500|$|Television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman {{originally}} pitched Friends as a {{show about}} [...] "that special <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life when your friends are your family" [...] to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield shortly after their short-lived sitcom Family Album was canceled by CBS. Inspired by their own experiences as young adults living in New York City, the writers loosely based the six main characters on {{some of their own}} friends and family; Monica is based on Kauffman herself. Observing that each main character was originally written as a [...] "one-note stereotype", Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Monica as the group's [...] "uptight fun-killer". When Friends first aired, the majority of its earliest episodes revolved around Monica, via whom each character appears to be interconnected; Friends stars the character's brother, her best friend, her former roommate and her two neighbors socializing in Monica's apartment.|$|E

500|$|After their {{short-lived}} {{television series}} Family Album was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about [...] "that special <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life when {{your friends are}} your family," [...] basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends. Conceived {{as a young woman}} who is unprepared for adulthood, the character Rachel Green was originally named Rachel Robbins. Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character when Friends premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot's most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on [...] "finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E

[...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of schoolâ€”in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

"Wind It Up", the album's lead single, {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics {{for its use}} of yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music, but was moderately successful, peaking inside the top 10 in the US and the UK. The title track was well received and was a major success, reaching the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Three more singles were released from the album; [...] "4 in the Morning", [...] "Now That You Got It" [...] which featured Damian Marley and [...] "Early Winter". To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated {{that she had no}} plans to continue work as a solo artist, adding, [...] "That was a moment in time... It went on a little longer than we all thought it would, because it was inspired and you have to go with wherever you're at in that <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life...
