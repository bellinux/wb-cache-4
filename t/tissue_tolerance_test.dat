The results showed that significant reductions (p < 0. 05) of photochemical efficiency in P. juliflora leaves were found after 96 h of exposure to 0. 52 M Cu 2 + compared with Cd-treatments and controls. In contrast, P. glandulosa leaves showed a progressive increase on photochemical efficiency at 72 h after Cu-treatment. The results also showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 05) of epidermal polyphenols in P. juliflora leaves after 24 h of exposure to 0. 52 M Cu 2 + compared with Cd-treatments and control leaves. On the other hand, the values of leaf epidermal polyphenols observed in P. glandulosa exposed to copper and cadmium did not show any difference with respect to control. These findings are very important and suggest that these compounds could {{be considered as a}} protection mechanism of P. glandulosa when is treated with these heavy metals. Finally, the results of bioaccumulation showed that the copper concentration in P. glandulosa was higher than the values detected in P. juliflora Nevertheless, the cadmium concentration in foliar tissues of P. juliflora was significantly higher than P. glandulosa after 96 h of exposure to Cu 2 + or Cd 2 +. Therefore, future studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of heavy metals on the biosynthesis of flavonoids and participation of these compounds in the reduction of metal toxicity in Prosopis species...|$|E

40|$|Ghrelin, a gastric peptide hormone, {{has been}} {{reported}} to regulate GH secretion and energy homeostasis. Here, we examined the effect of des-acyl ghrelin driven from the fatty acid-binding protein- 4 (FABP 4) promoter on adiposity and glucose metabolism. A high level of expression of des-acyl ghrelin (692 ± 293 fmol/g fat) in adipose tissue was detected in FABP 4 -ghrelin transgenic mice, but not in wild-type littermates. Circulating des-acyl ghrelin was significantly higher in FABP 4 -ghrelin transgenic mice (8409 ± 3390 pm) compared with wild-type mice (513 ± 58 pm). No significant change was observed for plasma acylated ghrelin and obestatin. Epididymal and perirenal fat masses decreased 35 ± 9 and 52 ± 9 %, respectively, in FABP 4 -ghrelin transgenic mice. FABP 4 -ghrelin transgenic mice are resistant to obesity induced by high-fat diet. Brown fat mass was not affected by overexpression of ghrelin in adipose <b>tissue.</b> Glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> showed glucose levels to be significantly lower in FABP 4 -ghrelin transgenic mice than in controls after glucose administration. Insulin sensitivity testing showed that FABP 4 -ghrelin transgenic mice had a 28 ± 5 % greater hypoglycemic response to insulin. Our study demonstrates that overexpression of ghrelin from the FABP 4 promoter impairs the development of white adipose tissues, and alters glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice...|$|R

Methods We selected and genotyped 80 men and postmenopausal women heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolaemia (main group) as well as 11 healthy control subjects. Patients were subgrouped based on their response to oral fat <b>tolerance</b> <b>test.</b> The oral fat <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> was defined as pathological when postprandial triglyceride concentration was higher than the highest triglyceride concentration observed in healthy subjects (220 mg/dl) at any time (2, 4, 6 or 8 h). Results In the pathological subgroup, men had significantly higher incremental area under the curve after oral fat <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> than postmenopausal women. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a gender association of TaqIB and I 405 V influence on postprandial lipaemia in this subgroup. Conclusion In conclusion, it seems that gender and TaqIB polymorphism of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene were both associated with the distribution of triglyceride values after oral fat <b>tolerance</b> <b>test,</b> only in subjects with a pathological response to oral fat <b>tolerance</b> <b>test.</b> Specifically, men carrying the B 2 allele of the TaqIB polymorphism showed a higher postprandial triglyceride peak and a delayed return to basal values compared with women carrying B 2.

40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdSalinity {{stress is}} a major factor inhibiting cereal yield throughout the world. Tolerance to salinity stress can be considered to contain three main components: Na+ exclusion, tolerance to Na+ in the <b>tissues</b> and osmotic <b>tolerance.</b> To date, most experimental work on salinity tolerance in cereals has focused on Na+ exclusion due in part to its ease of measurement. It has become apparent, however, that Na+ exclusion is not the sole mechanism for salinity tolerance in cereals, and research needs to expand to study osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Here, we develop assays for high throughput quantification of Na+ exclusion, Na+ <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> and osmotic tolerance in 12 Triticum monococcum accessions, mainly using commercially available image capture and analysis equipment. We show that different lines use different combinations of the three tolerance mechanisms to increase their total salinity tolerance, with a positive correlation observed between a plant's total salinity tolerance and the sum of its proficiency in Na+ exclusion, osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The assays developed in this study can be easily adapted for other cereals and used in high throughput, forward genetic experiments to elucidate the molecular basis of these components of salinity tolerance.

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} was the {{investigation}} of the intravenous glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> in young dairy bulls as an additional selection criterion in breeding value estimation. Response on glucose challenge in 541 bulls of the breed Deutsche Holstein within a defined period of 200 to 520 days of age {{on the basis of the}} intravenous glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> is targeted on within this study. The time response course after glucose challenge was the basis for the creation of individual glucose curves. All parameters glucose basal value; maximum glucose levels, maximum glucose increase; glucose area under the curve and glucose half-life fulfilled the criteria of normal distribution after logarithmic transformation. The fixed effects of each parameter were determined with the software program VCE (Groeneveld et al. 2010). Subsequently the heritability coefficients of glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> parameters were calculated with the program PEST (Groeneveld und Kovac 1990), adjusted by the effects of herd, year and season. Additionally the correlations between the progeny breeding values and the adjusted glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> parameters were calculated. Insulin sensitivity and glucose absorption capacity, as well as basal glucose levels, are, in terms of phenotypic peculiarities with regard to intravenous glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> parameters, influenced by feed rations. In order to make intravenous glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> comparisons it is necessary to determine and maintain standardized breeding conditions with standardized rations. The relationship between intravenous glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> parameters and the offspring breeding values for functional useful life, reproduction and calving ease, is subjected to a high influence of environmental effects on both sides of the algorithm. There are no significant correlations between the progeny breeding values and the results of glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests.</b> Thus it is not possible to establish a statement on the proportion of the genetically determined metabolic capacity in the health and reproductiveness of progeny on the basis of progeny breeding values. The tested animals were divided in groups of bulls with high, low and medium mean glucose half-life. The progeny breeding values were compared between those groups. Here as well were no significant relations observed. The least heritabilities were calculated for the parameters glucose basal value (h² = 0, 19), maximum glucose level (h² = 0, 14) and maximum glucose increase (h² = 0, 12). Thus those parameters are not qualified as a additional breeding value information. The heritability of the parameters glucose are under the curve (h² = 0, 43) and glucose half-life (h² = 0, 4) is significantly higher. The determined heritabilities indicate a medium genetic influence on the parameters of the intravenous glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests.</b> The glucose half-life is the most meaningful glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> parameter about the individual glucose homeostasis capacity. In contrast to the slightly higher heritable glucose area under the curve there are only minor methodical and mathematical influences on the glucose half-life. Therefore the glucose half-life is the best suited parameter for the characterization of the genetically determined reaction on a glucose stimulus in the glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test.</b> So it could be shown that the glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> in young bulls is suited as an additional selection criterion in breeding value estimation because of its genetically determination. To clarify the question about a relation between glucose tolerance and animal welfare further investigations are necessary. By the collection of clinical data in a large daughter count according to a rule a statement could be made on the relation of the glucose elimination rate of the sires to metabolic disruptions of the progeny as well as reproductive and milk performance of the daughters...|$|R

Brassica napus was the most tolerant species {{in terms of the}} overall performance, with Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea being much more sensitive to salt stress with no obvious difference between them. While prominent reduction in net CO 2 assimilation was observed in both sensitive species, physiological mechanisms beyond this reduction differed strongly. Brassica juncea plants possessed high osmotolerance and were able to maintain high transpiration rate but showed a significant reduction in leaf chlorophyll content and efficiency of leaf photochemistry. On the contrary, B. oleracea plants possessed the highest (among the three species) <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> but showed a very significant stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that the high <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> in B. oleracea was related to the ability of leaf mesophyll cells to maintain highly negative membrane potential in the presence of high apoplastic Na(+). In addition to high osmotolerance, the most tolerant B. napus showed also lesser accumulation of toxic Na(+) and Cl(-) in the leaf, possessed moderate <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> and had a superior K(+) retention ability.
