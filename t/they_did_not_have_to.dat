5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in south-western France. These divisions raced {{north along the}} Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire to link up {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E
5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E

In the preliminary round, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play as Guiena withdrew from the tournament. In the first round, {{they were supposed to}} play Nigeria but withdrew from the tournament. They were supposed to compete in the 2010 African Women U-20 Championship Qualifying competition meeting Togo in the first round, but Togo earned a walk over win against Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone eventually withdrew from the competition. The announcement was made a week after the under-17 lost 0–3 to Gambia.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 1968, {{the team}} {{acquired}} Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers. In {{his first season}} as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1rpg. West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division. The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston {{for the first time}} in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points, and had a 3–2 lead after five. Boston won the series in seven games however, and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award. In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2ppg, the team returned to the finals, and {{for the first time in}} 16 years, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3. The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell {{resigned}} as manager in February 1950 {{and was replaced}} in April with Dick Duckworth, a former York player. York were forced to apply for re-election to retain {{their place in the}} Football League for the first time, after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949–50. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> enter the ballot because the Football League was to be extended to 92 clubs for 1950–51. Despite York's senior team's troubles, the reserve team scored over 100 goals to finish sixth in the Midland League, and won the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time after beating Middlesbrough 3–0 at Ayresome Park in the final. York's fortunes improved in 1950–51; they ranked 17th in the league and reached the FA Cup third round {{for the first time since}} 1946, when they were beaten 2–0 by First Division team Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park. York's best post-war season to date came in 1951–52, as they finished in 10th place and set a home record of 16 wins, four draws and three defeats. York chased promotion in 1952–53, and by late January 1953 they were third in the table. They finished in fourth place with 53 points; both new club records in the Football League. During this season, Duckworth was reluctantly released from his contract in October 1952 to take charge at Stockport County. His successor, the former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer, died in February 1953. Sheffield United's assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, and by late December York were bottom of the table. A win in the last match of 1953–54 meant they finished in 22nd place, and avoided having to apply for re-election. Sessions {{resigned as}} chairman in November 1953 and was succeeded by Hugh Kitchin.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, government officials said that women received the closer parking spots so <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> walk as far with kids.

25|$|The {{military}} contracts {{were very}} lucrative because <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> arrange distribution {{to a large}} number of retailers, rather they sold in bulk directly to one customer, the Third Reich. By 1939, HASAG had become one of the biggest arms manufacturers in Germany, with 3,700 employees and annual sales of 22 million Reichmarks. Under Renner's leadership, HASAG remained one of the largest arms manufacturers in central Germany till the end of World War II.|$|E

25|$|Prices dropped quickly {{both for}} {{passenger}} tickets and freight transfer.

25|$|The airline has its {{background}} {{in a group}} of parachuters who in 1968 established Paralift Air Service.

It took delivery of a Cessna 180 in February 1969, which it kept until August that year. It then took over a Cessna 182. These aircraft were both tailored as parachute-only aircraft. The following year the fleet was doubled with the arrival of a Cessna 310.|$|E
25|$|Survivors {{of ships}} sunk by Allied {{submarines}} frequently refused to surrender, {{and many of}} the prisoners who were captured by submariners were taken by force. US Navy submarines were occasionally ordered to obtain prisoners for intelligence purposes, and formed special teams of personnel for this purpose. Overall, however, Allied submariners usually did not attempt to take prisoners, and the number of Japanese personnel they captured was relatively small. The submarines which took prisoners normally did so towards the end of their patrols so that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be guarded for a long time.|$|E
