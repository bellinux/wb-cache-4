5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort.

His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E

In 1967, the highway-only Poplar Street Bridge opened to move traffic {{from all three}} expressways over the Mississippi River. The openings of the Arch in 1965 and the bridge in 1967 were accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new stadium for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals moved into Busch Memorial Stadium early in the 1966 season.

5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory.

5|$|On 14 January 1858, an Italian {{refugee from}} Britain called Felice Orsini {{attempted}} to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England. The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government, and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister. Victoria and Albert attended <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on 5 August 1858, {{in an attempt}} by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy {{in comparison to the}} French one. Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.|$|E

With <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new front in North Africa in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter this threat the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) were tasked with bombing raids in an effort to neutralise the RAF defences and the ports.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York {{consented to}} allow the board of {{trustees}} to authorize <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law school and a medical school. St. John's College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name Fordham refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the Bronx River ("ford by the hamlet"). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into the Bronx {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, the village became the borough's Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just to the west of the Rose Hill campus.|$|E

The service opened in November 1939 and remained part of the Bakerloo line until 1979 when it transferred to the Jubilee line.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw the Down Relief line, {{the most}} {{southern}} {{of the four}} running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage sidings to the east with the West Depot carriage sidings to the west.
