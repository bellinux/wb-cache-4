5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the <b>traveler</b> begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the <b>traveler</b> falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the <b>traveler</b> new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the <b>traveler</b> took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E
40|$|Business <b>travelers</b> visiting {{events have}} {{received}} limited attention from researchers {{compared with the}} attention paid to leisure <b>travelers.</b> In this study, economic impacts from various categories of visitors at various sporting events are compared with a specific focus on differences between business <b>travelers</b> and leisure <b>travelers</b> in terms of numbers and economic impacts. The {{article is based on}} empirical data from four different world championships in Nordic Ski, Ice Hockey, Judo, and Indoor Climbing. In terms of numbers, leisure <b>travelers</b> clearly outnumber business <b>travelers</b> whereas in terms of economic impacts business <b>travelers</b> are often equally important. These results indicate that particular efforts to describe business <b>travelers</b> may be needed in economic impact studies...|$|R

40|$|Background. Previous studies {{investigating}} the travelers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) profile indicated an important educational need among those traveling to risk destinations. Initiatives to improve such education should target all groups of <b>travelers,</b> including business <b>travelers,</b> those visiting {{friends and relatives}} (VFR), and older adult <b>travelers.</b> Methods. In the years 2002 to 2009, a longitudinal questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the Dutch Schiphol Airport with the aim to study trends in KAP of travel risk groups toward prevention of hepatitis A. The risk groups last-minute <b>travelers,</b> solo <b>travelers,</b> business <b>travelers,</b> <b>travelers</b> VFR, and older adult <b>travelers</b> were specifically studied. Results. A total of 3, 045 respondents were included in the survey. <b>Travelers</b> to destinations with a high risk for hepatitis A had significantly less accurate risk perceptions (knowledge) than <b>travelers</b> to low-to-intermediate-risk destinations. The relative risk for hepatitis A in <b>travelers</b> to high-risk destinations was probably mitigated by less intended risk-seeking behavior and by higher protection rates against hepatitis A as compared with <b>travelers</b> to low-to-intermediate-risk destinations. Logistic regression analyses showed that an age > 60 years was the only significant determinant for improvement of their knowledge. Trend analyses showed a significant change over time in attitude toward more risk-avoiding behavior and toward higher protection rates against hepatitis A in <b>travelers</b> to high-risk destinations. The KAP profile of the risk groups <b>travelers</b> VFR (irrespective of hepatitis A risk of their destination) and solo as well as last-minute <b>travelers</b> to high-risk destinations substantially increased their relative risk for hepatitis A. Conclusions. The results of this longitudinal survey in Dutch <b>travelers</b> suggest an annual 5 % increase in protection rates against hepatitis A coinciding with an annual 1 % decrease in intended risk-seeking behavior. This improvement may reflect the continuous efforts of travel health advice providers to create awareness and to propagate safe and healthy travel. The KAP profile of <b>travelers</b> {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFR) and solo as well as last-minute <b>travelers</b> to high-risk destinations substantially increased their relative risk for hepatitis A. These risk groups should be candidates for targeted intervention...|$|R

5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} each area are stones at which the <b>traveler</b> rests; these stones give the <b>traveler</b> the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), which allows Mainland Chinese <b>travelers</b> (hereafter called Chinese <b>travelers)</b> to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis, has been beneficial to the fast recovery of the local economy in Hong Kong from {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS). The INS <b>travelers,</b> together with the packaged <b>travelers</b> who visited Hong Kong by joining packaged tours, are presently forming the largest segment of inbound <b>travelers</b> to Hong Kong. Despite the significant economic contributions of Chinese <b>travelers</b> to Hong Kong in general, and to the foodservice sector in particular, there has been an absence of prior studies on IVS travelers' behavior of selecting restaurants in the existing hospitality and tourism literature. This paper reports on an exploratory study that investigated the perceived importance of attributes that pertain to the selection of restaurants from the perspective of IVS and packaged <b>travelers</b> from Mainland China. Empirical findings of a questionnaire survey with 230 Chinese <b>travelers,</b> including 127 IVS <b>travelers</b> and 103 packaged <b>travelers,</b> showed that the respondents in general viewed the included attributes as relatively important. In addition, only two attributes exhibited significant differences between IVS and packaged <b>travelers.</b> Findings of this research would be useful for hospitality and tourism practitioners to better prepare for receiving the growing number of Chinese <b>travelers.</b> School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{understand}} more about pre-travel preparations and itineraries of business and occupational <b>travelers.</b> METHODS: De-identified data from 18 Global TravEpiNet clinics from January 2009 to December 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 23, 534 <b>travelers,</b> 61 % were non-occupational and 39 % occupational. Business <b>travelers</b> were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business <b>travelers</b> indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational <b>travelers</b> sought consultations because of travel health concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-groups of occupational <b>travelers</b> have characteristic profiles, with business <b>travelers</b> being particularly distinct. Employers play a role in encouraging business <b>travelers</b> to seek pre-travel consultations.
