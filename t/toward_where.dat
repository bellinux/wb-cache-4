25|$|Not all the {{soldiers}} were agreed to stay together. They began grumbling and thinking {{that it was going}} to be every man for himself as the bison hunters described it. Two men fell behind and were lost to Nolan. Through the pounding heat and endless march, men began to fall. Nolan continued to assign the strongest with the weakest. The desire for water stood above all else as Nolan headed south-east <b>toward</b> <b>where</b> he knew water was.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place {{his hands behind his}} back, and handcuffed him, leaving him face down on the ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back <b>toward</b> <b>where</b> the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E
25|$|The Emir Farouk sank {{in about}} five minutes. Yohai Bin-Nun, {{who was in the}} reserve boat, noticed the mistake made by Vardi, and himself rammed the {{minesweeper}}. He was spotted and fired at, and managed to eject from his boat only 40m short of the target. The minesweeper suffered significant damage, but did not sink and was hauled back to Alexandria. It was subsequently scrapped by the Egyptian Navy. Egyptian coastal artillery opened a barrage on the general area, but did not spot their targets. The extraction boat collected the commandos and remained in the area to assess the damage, estimating about 200–300 Egyptian survivors. At 22:25 it started moving <b>toward</b> <b>where</b> it believed the Maoz was. The commandos, despite spotting it from a very close range, found the Maoz closer than they had thought, and by 23:10 all the commandos were back on the ship.|$|E

25|$|At the {{railroad}} tracks, Chanie {{turns in the}} direction away from the school and <b>toward</b> <b>where</b> he thinks his home will be. When it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold. After his death, a mother lynx lifts Chanie’s spirit and carries him into the forest, away from the tracks. In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.|$|E
500|$|A [...] fastball {{from the}} Cubs' Mike Montgomery on August 11, 2016, struck Holliday {{on the right}} thumb, {{fracturing}} it. [...] The Cardinals placed him on the DL. [...] Presented with the option to either allow the thumb to heal naturally or with surgery, Holliday elected surgery as that would have potentially allowed him to return before season's end. [...] He encountered multiple delays in recovery. [...] Having been informed {{in the final days}} of the 2016 season that the Cardinals would not pick up the option for 2017 worth $17 million, he was activated from the DL − although his thumb was still fractured − in time for the September 30 game against Pittsburgh. [...] He hit his first career pinch-hit home run in that game and 20th of the season. [...] Holliday released a statement: [...] "While I'm disappointed this could be it here in St. Louis, I understand that it might be time to move on." [...] While his batting average had dropped to a career-low [...]246, Holliday was optimistic about a rebound. [...] Because he produced the third-highest exit velocity at [...] of all hitters with at least 100 batted balls in 2016, he concluded that to [...] "have my misses be more in the air than on the ground, my numbers could really get back <b>toward</b> <b>where</b> they have been my whole career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{authors of}} expository writing show a {{predisposition}} to capitalizing the initials {{of the expansion}} for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention <b>toward</b> <b>where</b> the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals {{in the middle of}} sentences for proper nouns. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography. [...] Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters. For example, ...|$|E
