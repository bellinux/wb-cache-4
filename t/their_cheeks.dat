5|$|The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, {{in their}} plumage, {{and have a}} similar pattern {{to that in the}} {{corresponding}} sex of house sparrow. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks, as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.|$|E
5|$|When {{meeting for}} the first time or after they have separated, {{individuals}} may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing <b>their</b> <b>cheeks,</b> moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other's genitals. They then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their heads on one another. This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E

5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E

25|$|Tati (red) is {{the code}} {{for someone with}} an evil streak such as Ravana, Dushasana and Hiranyakashipu. Some {{characters}} have green face (representing heroic or excellences as a warrior) with red dots or lines on <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> or red colored mustache or red streaked beard (representing evil inner nature), while others have full face and beard colored red, the latter implying excessively evil characters. Kari (black) is the code for forest dwellers, hunters, and middle ground character. Demonesses and treacherous characters are also painted black but with streaks or patches of red.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{most members}} of the subfamily, the golden hamster has {{expandable}} cheek pouches, which extend from its cheeks to its shoulders. In the wild, hamsters are larder hoarders; they use <b>their</b> <b>cheek</b> pouches to transport food to their burrows. Their name in the local Arabic dialect where they were found roughly translates to [...] "mister saddlebags" [...] (Arabic: أبو جراب) due to the amount of storage space in <b>their</b> <b>cheek</b> pouches.

During lateral motion the leg {{in the direction of the}} movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.|$|E
25|$|Face {{painting}} {{died out}} in Western culture {{after the fall}} of the French aristocracy. During the 19th century blackface theatrical makeup gained popularity when it was used by non-black performers to represent black people, typically in a minstrel show. Its use ended in the United States with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s at about the same time that face painting re-entered the popular culture as part of the hippie movement of the late 1960s, when it was common for young women to decorate <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> with flowers or peace symbols at anti-war demonstrations.|$|E
25|$|About 70% of {{domestic}} cats are especially attracted to, and {{affected by the}} plant Nepeta cataria, otherwise known as catnip. Wild cats, including tigers, are also affected, but with unknown percentage. The first reaction of cats is to sniff. Then, they lick and sometimes chew the plant and after that rub against it, with <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> and the whole body by rolling over. If cats consume concentrated extract of the plant, they quickly show signs of over-excitement such as violent twitching, profuse salivation and sexual arousal. The reaction {{is caused by the}} volatile terpenoids called nepetalactones present in the plant. Although they are mildly toxic and repel insects from the plant, their concentration is too low to poison cats.|$|E
50|$|They also {{communicate}} through {{the sense of}} smell. A gland located in <b>their</b> <b>cheek</b> exudes chemicals which they rub on scenting points, such as shrubs and rocks, which can be smelled by other marmots in the area.|$|R

500|$|Typically diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), the jungle cat hunts {{throughout}} the day; activity tends to decrease during the hot noon hours. It rests in burrows, grass thickets and scrubs. The cat often sunbathes on winter days. Jungle cats have been estimated to walk [...] at night, although this likely {{varies depending on}} the availability of prey. The behaviour of the jungle cat has not been extensively studied. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably except in the mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking; some males have been observed rubbing <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> on objects to mark them.|$|E

[...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> at Joe and his comicalities."

They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on <b>their</b> <b>cheeks,</b> which can spark with electricity. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an indent {{at the end of}} its tail, giving it a heart-shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or [...] "evolve" [...] into a Raichu when exposed to a [...] "Thunderstone". In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named [...] "Pichu", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer.|$|E
50|$|Mirror-touch synesthesia is a {{condition}} which causes individuals to experience the same sensation (such as touch) that another person feels. For example, if someone with this condition were to observe someone touching <b>their</b> <b>cheek,</b> they would feel the same sensation on <b>their</b> own <b>cheek.</b> Synesthesia, in general, is described as {{a condition}} in which a stimulus causes an individual to experience an additional sensation. Synesthesia is usually a developmental condition; however, recent research has shown that mirror touch synesthesia can be acquired after sensory loss following amputation.|$|R

500|$|Slay Tracks {{received}} generally positive reviews. Much of {{the initial}} critical reception to Slay Tracks was from zines to whom Kannberg had sent the EP. A review in the San Francisco-based zine Maximum RocknRoll said [...] "Most of the tunes work {{by virtue of their}} eclecticism, freshness, and originality—this is a good one." [...] The zine Conflict called the EP [...] "absolutely perfect." [...] Slay Tracks also received attention from mainstream publications. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice rated Slay Tracks an A-, and selected it as his fourth favorite EP of 1990. Spins review said: [...] "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. ... What a party!" [...] A reviewer for Option praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP [...] "loose and intentionally lo-fi," [...] and saying [...] "let's hope this Pavement stays cracked." [...] College Music Journals review was also favorable, noting [...] "You're Killing Me" [...] and [...] "She Believes" [...] as highlights, and calling the EP a [...] "deep, intoxicating breath of homemade music from people with tongues in <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive [...] melodic balance, and whether that is in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential." ...|$|E

50|$|Most {{kangaroo}} rats are exclusively nocturnal. Even so, {{they tend}} to avoid being outside their burrows when the moon is full. The greater the amounts of moonlight the less time they spend collecting food, defending their territory, or searching for mates. When the amount of moonlight is great they retreat underground {{in order to avoid}} predation. In some areas, above ground activity is limited to two hours or less. During the day, they remain in their cool burrows. They often seal entrances to their burrows with soil to prevent exposure to heat. When they are active above ground they move about within their territory and attempt to fill <b>their</b> <b>cheek</b> pouches with seeds and plant material. When <b>their</b> <b>cheek</b> pouches are full they retreat to their burrows where they disgorge the seeds they have collected. Some of the food is eaten immediately while the remainder is stored (often building a seed cache of considerable size) in several chambers within the burrow system.|$|R

2500|$|The aye-aye is classically {{considered}} 'solitary' as {{they have}} not been observed to groom each other. However, recent research suggests it is more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to , while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to [...] It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range.

2500|$|Following the Spanish {{conquest of}} the Aztecs in 1521, many Spanish missionary-ethnographers arrived and {{recorded}} graphic and often unsympathetic descriptions of these rituals among both the Mayan and Nahuatl speaking peoples. Although most understood the religious significance of the rites, such idolatry merely confirmed the need for rapid conversion to Christianity. Many also confused genital bloodletting with circumcision, not least because they believed Indians were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. One {{of the first to}} recognise the distinction was Diego de Landa in a 1566 manuscript:"At times they sacrificed their own blood, cutting all around the ears in strips which they let hang as a sign. At other times they perforated <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> or the lower lip; again they made cuts in parts of the body, or pierced the tongue crossways and passed stalks through, causing extreme pain; again they hewed at the superfluous part of the penis, leaving the flesh in the [...] form of two floppy ears. It was this custom which misled [...] the historian-general of the Indies to say that they practised circumcision."(original translation) ...|$|E

Puyi commented as he read out his speech praising the glories of dying for the Emperor: [...] "Only then did I see the ashen grey of their faces and the tears flowing down <b>their</b> <b>cheeks</b> and hear their sobbing." [...] Puyi commented that he felt at that moment utterly [...] "terrified" [...] at the death cult fanaticism of Bushido ("the way of the warrior") which reduced the value of human life down to nothing, as to die for the Emperor {{was the only thing that}} mattered; he observed that the Japanese infantrymen all had families and friends who cared for them, and had quite possibly been bullied by their officers into becoming [...] "human bullets". Yoshioka tried to reassure Puyi by saying that the [...] "human bullets" [...] were crying [...] "manly Japanese tears" [...] as deep down they wanted to die for the Emperor, but Puyi later stated he was not convinced by this argument.|$|E
