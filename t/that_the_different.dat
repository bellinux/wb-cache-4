5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E

25|$|A recent use {{of equal}} {{protection}} doctrine came in Bush v. Gore (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in Florida {{in the aftermath}} of the 2000 presidential election. There, the Supreme Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices Souter and Breyer joined the majority of five—but only, it should be emphasized, for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.|$|E
25|$|A new way {{of looking}} at {{carcinogenesis}} comes from integrating the ideas of developmental biology into oncology. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> kinds of cells in a heterogeneous tumor arise from a single cell, termed Cancer Stem Cell. Cancer stem cells may arise from transformation of adult stem cells or differentiated cells within a body. These cells persist as a subcomponent of the tumor and retain key stem cell properties. They give rise to a variety of cells, are capable of self-renewal and homeostatic control. Furthermore, the relapse of cancer and the emergence of metastasis are also attributed to these cells. The cancer stem cell hypothesis does not contradict earlier concepts of carcinogenesis. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has been a proposed mechanism that contributes to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} compressors and stretchers. However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> wavelength components must experience about 10cm difference in path length. The most practical way to achieve this is with grating-based stretchers and compressors. Stretchers and compressors are characterized by their dispersion. With negative dispersion, light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With positive dispersion, it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor should cancel out. Because of practical considerations, the stretcher is usually designed with positive dispersion and the compressor with negative dispersion.|$|E

25|$|Krishna is also worshiped {{across many}} other traditions of Hinduism, and Krishna {{and the stories}} {{associated}} with him appear across {{a broad spectrum of}} different Hindu philosophical and theological traditions, where it is believed that God appears to his devoted worshippers in many different forms, depending on their particular desires. These forms include the different avataras of Krishna described in traditional Vaishnava texts, but they are not limited to these. Indeed, it is said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> expansions of the Svayam bhagavan are uncountable and they cannot be fully described in the finite scriptures of any one religious community. Many of the Hindu scriptures sometimes differ in details reflecting the concerns of a particular tradition, while some core features of the view on Krishna are shared by all.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} design {{decision}} Wertich made {{related to the}} complexity of the game's economic system. Due to the innovations he planned to introduce to the mechanics, and because the supply and demand-based gameplay of Settlers III was going to be more intricate than in previous titles, he felt that forcing players to concentrate too much on logistics would serve as an unwelcome distraction, and so decided to remove the need for a road network. Instead, settlers would have the freedom to move anywhere within the player's settlement, with the AI handling pathfinding. Another early decision was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> races in Settlers III wouldn't just look different, they would have different abilities, different economic models and certain buildings unique to each one. Wertich, in consultation with Hertzler, also decided to create the game in high color, a first for the series, which had used 8-bit color for previous titles.|$|E
25|$|The {{incoming}} beam {{is shaped}} by slits of a few tens of micrometers such that the transverse coherence length {{is greater than the}} grating period. The interferometer consists of three parallel and equally spaced phase gratings, and an x-ray camera. The incident beam is diffracted by a first grating of period 2P into two beams. These are further diffracted by a second grating of period P into four beams. Two of the four merge at a third grating of period 2P. Each is further diffracted by the third grating. The multiple diffracted beams are allowed to propagate for sufficient distance such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> diffraction orders are separated at the camera. There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third grating to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the incident beam. The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E

25|$|Whether or {{not this}} or indeed any so called 'super-dairy' is ever built, this {{controversy}} {{is likely to have}} a lasting impact on Britain's future dairy policy. Supporters claim large scale farming offers opportunities to meet food security and climate change challenges of the future. Research by opponents counter this hypothesis with an argument that the economics of the system are unsustainable in a report titled: ''; however, the figures used in this report have also been heavily criticised by the industry's leading providers of economics data DairyCo, part of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> systems are not being compared on a like for like basis and are ‘astonishingly naïve’. However, there are concerns that any similar proposal, if successful, would set a precedent for the development of large-scale farming systems more commonly associated with the US where such units are known as CAFOs - although with the definition of a dairy CAFO being over 750 cows, , the dairy industry's levy and advisory body, says there are already at least 12 such farms operating successfully and without issues - as proven by the lack of media interest in these farms - in England.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the other}} poems {{making up the}} Four Quartets, Little Gidding deals with the past, present, and future, and humanity's place within them as each {{generation}} is seemingly united. In the second section, there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets, including Dante, Swift, Yeats, and others. When the ghost joins the poet, the narrator states [...] "Knowing myself yet being someone other". This suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> times merge {{at the same time}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> personalities begin to merge, allowing a communication and connection with the dead. Later, in the fourth section, humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London; redemption or destruction. God's love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the living hell through purgation by fire. The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet. He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society.|$|E
