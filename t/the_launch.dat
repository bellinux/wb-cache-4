5|$|On 18 January, {{a problem}} with the {{computers}} aboard Mir developed shortly before fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> was due to occur. <b>The</b> <b>launch</b> attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the computer and the station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed.|$|E
5|$|Challenger finally {{launched}} at 06:32 UTC (02:32 EDT) on August 30, 1983, after a final 17-minute delay due to thunderstorms near <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>launch</b> window {{extended from}} 06:15 to 06:49.

Following <b>the</b> <b>launch,</b> Progress M1-5 {{spent three}} days in free flight before docking with the rear port of the Kvant-1 module of Mir at 05:33:31 GMT on 27 January. The docking port had previously been occupied by Progress M-43, which departed at 05:19:49 on 25 January, and subsequently remained in orbit until Progress M1-5 had docked with Mir. Progress M-43, which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise Mirs orbit, in anticipation of manned flights which were never launched, was subsequently deorbited at 02:12 GMT on 29 January, burning up during re-entry at 02:58.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>launch</b> had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> pad. During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall {{just south of the}} Kennedy Space Center on the morning of August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and {{there was no time to}} roll Challenger back from the pad; the decision was made to secure <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
