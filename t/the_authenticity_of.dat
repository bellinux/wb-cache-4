2500|$|Origen's {{statement}} in his Commentary on Matthew (...) that Josephus [...] "did not accept Jesus as Christ", is usually {{seen as a}} confirmation of the generally accepted fact that Josephus did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah. This forms a key external argument against <b>the</b> total <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Testimonium in that Josephus, as a Jew, would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and the reference to [...] "he was Christ" [...] in the Testimonium must be a Christian interpolation. Based on this observation alone, Paul L. Maier calls the case for <b>the</b> total <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Testimonium [...] "hopeless".

40|$|An exegetic-hermeneutical {{research}} on the Jonah evidences in Matthew 12 : 38 ff The New Testament interpretation of the “sign of Jonah” (Math 12 : 38 ff) cannot be applied as a criterion to legitimate <b>the</b> historical <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story about Jonah and the great fish in the Old Testament. It is, however, possible to recognise the authority of Jesus’ citation in Matthew 12 : 38 ff and simultaneously quash <b>the</b> historical <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence about Jonah and the great fish. Matthew created a new authoritative text with an exegitical method inherent in his own context and never tried to verify <b>the</b> historical <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence about Jonah and the “three days and three nights” {{in the belly of}} the fish.

5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> this charter. In particular, {{he felt that}} the two {{separate}} addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> evidence.|$|E
