Setting: Neonatology unitof the Paediatrics department of a teaching hospital. Participants: Randomly selected pregnant mothers admit­ted to the maternity ward and <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> delivered to them. Sample Size: 120 pregnant mothers and <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> delivered. Study Variables: Candida, Site of colonization. Statistical Analysis: By tests of significance Results: Candida was isolated from 23 (19. 16 %) infants on the first day increasing to 52 (43. 33 %) infants on the sixth day.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} cognitive and social competences of newborn infants as face recognition, ability to imitate facial gestures and communicative skills. The preferential looking paradigm showed that newborns prefer {{to look at}} a human face-like stimulus compared to any other non human face-like stimulus. Furthermore, it is highlighted a newborn preference {{to look at a}} new face compared to a face previously seen from the habituation procedure (novelty effect); to explain this effect, it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> are able to build a perceptive representation of the face that they looked at, like an expression of a motivation for novelty. This effect disappeared if the known face is the mother’s face which is looked at more when it is compared to a new face (familiarity effect); it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> are able to build a dynamic “social” representation of the face through few communicative interactions with their mother in the first hours of life. The studies about the novelty effect and the familiarity effect are based on a preference-task, where a new face is compared with a known face.

40|$|Maternal smoking {{has been}} {{associated}} with elevated risk of type 2 diabetes among the offspring in adulthood. The mechanisms underlying this fetal "programming" effect remain unclear. The present study sought to explore whether maternal smoking affects metabolic health biomarkers in fetuses/newborns. In a prospective singleton pregnancy cohort (n = 248), we compared metabolic health biomarkers in <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> of smoking and non-smoking mothers. Outcomes included cord plasma insulin, proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, leptin and adiponectin concentrations, glucose-to-insulin ratio (an indicator of insulin sensitivity) and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (an indicator of β-cell function). Independent of maternal (glucose tolerance, age, ethnicity, parity, education, body mass index, alcohol use) and infant (sex, gestational age, birth weight z score, mode of delivery, cord blood glucose concentration) characteristics, <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> of smoking mothers had lower IGF-I concentrations (mean: 6. 7 vs. 8. 4 nmol/L, adjusted p = 0. 006), and marginally higher proinsulin-to-insulin ratios (0. 94 vs. 0. 72, adjusted p = 0. 06) than <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> of non-smoking mothers. Cord plasma insulin, proinsulin, IGF-II, leptin and adiponectin concentrations and glucose-to-insulin ratios were similar in <b>the</b> <b>newborns</b> of smoking and non-smoking mothers. Maternal smoking was associated with decreased fetal IGF-I levels, and borderline lower fetal β-cell function. Larger cohort studies are required to confirm the latter finding.
