5|$|After {{the release}} of Simple Science, the band decided to combine the {{remaining}} tracks—along with three more newly recorded songs—into a new full-length album, <b>There</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Rules.</b> They also confirmed that the album would not be released on Vagrant Records, who had released their previous three albums, but on their own Quality Hill Records. The album was produced by Ed Rose and mixed by Bob Weston, who produced the band's debut album. <b>There</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Rules</b> was released on January 25, 2011, and {{was supported by a}} co-headlining tour with Saves The Day.|$|E

Rick pleads with Hershel to not force them to leave and to reconsider his request.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{internal}} conflicts, the band broke up in 2005. Three years later, the band reunited {{to support the}} tenth anniversary re-release of Something to Write Home About, and soon afterward entered the studio to write new material. In early 2010, the band released Simple Science, their first release in six years, followed in 2011 by the full-length <b>There</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Rules.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since {{the colonial}} age, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>rules</b> {{issued by the}} {{authorities}} from Spain to regulate the official documents’ preservation, such as real identification cards (<b>there</b> <b>were</b> obligatory <b>rules</b> issued by the king in the West Indies) and real provisions (document used by the royal audience to execute a real identification card to the province’s governors and other lower authorities) which help to prove some established norms with documents during that period.|$|R
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules.</b> And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
25|$|In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, {{catching}} and kicking.

25|$|Most MMORPGs provide {{different}} types of classes that players can choose. Among those classes, {{a small portion of}} players choose to roleplay their characters, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> that provide functionality and content to those who do. Community resources such as forums and guides exist in support of this play style.|$|E
25|$|For {{refutation}} tableaux, {{the objective}} is to show that the negation of a formula cannot be satisfied. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> for handling each of the usual connectives, starting with the main connective. In many cases, applying these rules causes the subtableau to divide into two. Quantifiers are instantiated. If any branch of a tableau leads to an evident contradiction, the branch closes. If all branches close, the proof is complete and the original formula is a logical truth.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{television}} game shows, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> {{in place for}} who is allowed to appear as a contestant on Jeopardy!

50|$|Lord Hoffman for the Privy Council {{advised that}} ‘there {{would be little}} sense in deeming such a persona ficta to exist unless <b>there</b> <b>were</b> also <b>rules</b> to tell one what acts were to count as acts of the company. It is {{therefore}} {{a necessary part of}} corporate personality that <b>there</b> should <b>be</b> <b>rules</b> by which acts are attributed to the company. These may <b>be</b> called ‘the <b>rules</b> of attribution’. <b>There</b> can <b>be</b> <b>rules</b> in the constitution or rules implied (e.g. shareholders acting unanimously are the company, Multinational Gas). Otherwise, the principles of agency apply, and the company acts through its servants and agents.|$|R

25|$|In Korea, {{unlike in}} China, Japan and Vietnam, the rice or soup bowl is not {{lifted from the}} table when eating from it. This {{is due to the}} fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> which reflect the decorum of sharing {{communal}} side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal.|$|E
25|$|During general play, players may {{position}} themselves {{anywhere on the}} field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as pushing an opponent in the back), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, spectacular marking, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.|$|E
500|$|Another {{view is that}} Section 3 {{provides}} a much strengthened basis {{for the sort of}} [...] "weak review" [...] the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other [...] in a statutory form. There have been at least three criticisms put forward: firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament. Secondly, whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable; thirdly, if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent, section 3 may render section 4 necessary. However, judicial powers are probably not unconstrained. The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism, depending on the viewpoint. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague, and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament, this viewpoint is controversial: they do not seem to have yet so encroached and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> emerging about the application of section 3.|$|E

500|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{film critics}} have written favorably about the film. It has been {{hailed as a}} masterpiece by Kent Jones, Adolf Heinzlmeier, Berndt Schulz and Penelope Gilliatt, who said it was [...] "not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, not only a great work of humanism in a perfect rococo frame, but also an act of historical testimony." [...] Its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and Renoir's biographer Leo Braudy, who observed that the film [...] "embodies a social world in which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> but no values. If you don't know the rules, you are crushed; {{but if you do}} know the rules you are cut off from your own nature." [...] Dudley Andrew described the film's [...] "complex social criticism" [...] while Kenneth Browser and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity. Other critics have written about the film's darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir's storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it [...] "so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can't simply watch it, you have to absorb it", Luc Sante, who called it [...] "a dense clockwork mechanism" [...] and Robin Wood, who said the film [...] "operates on all levels." [...] Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael called it [...] "a great satirical comedy, a dance of death" [...] and Gerald Mast wrote [...] " [...] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care." [...] David Thomson praised Renoir's performance and remarked on [...] "Renoir's admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances." [...] Amy Taubin said [...] "I can think of no other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium." [...] J. Hoberman wrote about its influence on Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.|$|E

2500|$|The Market's [...] "Meet the Producer" [...] mandate now {{includes}} craftspeople {{as well as}} farmers. Both can rent daystalls. Farmers take historic precedence, but the PDA [...] "acknowledges the rightful and permanent position of handmade arts and crafts as an integral use of the Market's Daystalls" [...] and their rules seek to encourage a lively mix. Some [...] "grandfathered" [...] vendors are allowed to sell merchandise not of their own making on essentially the same terms as craftspeople.

2500|$|According to Orthodox Judaism, {{the first}} oleh (person called to read) is a kohen [...] {{and the second}} a levi; the {{remaining}} olim are yisr'elim [...] Jews who are neither kohen [...] nor levi. (This assumes that such people are available; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> in place for what is done if they are not.) The first two aliyot {{are referred to as}} [...] "Kohen [...] " [...] and [...] "Levi," [...] while the rest are known by their number (in Hebrew). This practice is also followed in some but not all Conservative synagogues. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have abolished special ritual roles for the descendants of the Biblical priestly and levitical castes.|$|E
2500|$|The consonants in Pitman's {{shorthand}} are pronounced bee, pee, dee, tee, jay, chay, gay, kay, vee, eff, thee, ith, zee, ess, zhee, ish, [...] em, el, en, ray ar, ing, way, yay, and [...] hay. When both an unvoiced consonant and its corresponding voiced consonant {{are present}} in this system, the distinction is made by drawing the stroke for the voiced consonant thicker than the one for the unvoiced consonant. (Thus s is [...] and z is [...]) There are two strokes for r: ar and ray.
