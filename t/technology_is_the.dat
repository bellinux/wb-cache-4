These type of <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> telecommunications <b>technologies</b> that offers transmission of wireless. In such kind of networks each mobile user is controlled by its owner base station. As a node move outside the coverage area of its base station, this process is called handover. To keep the uninterrupted communication between two nodes during <b>the</b> handover process <b>is</b> a challenging task. In case of vertical handover this process is more critical. To perform the effective handover process <b>the</b> parametric changes <b>are</b> suggested here to perform the selection of Base Station. The obtained results shows the proposed work has improve the network throughput during vertical handover process...|$|R
