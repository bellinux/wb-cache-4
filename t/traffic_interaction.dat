40|$|This paper {{developed}} a cell-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) formulation {{that follows the}} ideal dynamic user optimal (DUO) principle. Through defining an appropriate gap function, we transformed a formulation based on the nonlinear complementarity problem to an equivalent mathematical program. To improve the accuracy of dynamic traffic modelling, this formulation encapsulates a network version of the cell transmission model (CTM). We set up four scenarios to evaluate the properties of this formulation, in the aspects of <b>traffic</b> dynamics, <b>traffic</b> <b>interactions</b> across multiple links, and the ideal DUO principle. This formulation produced outputs that are in agreement with what the results ought to be. Namely, the formulation is able to capture dynamic traffic phenomena, such as shock-waves, queue formation, and dissipation. Moreover, {{it is capable of}} capturing dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>interactions</b> across multiple links. Both of these characteristics are inherent from the underlying traffic model adopted in this formulation. The results also demonstrate that this cell-based formulation follows the ideal DUO principle. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{will have to}} coordinate their behavior with human road users such as drivers and pedestrians. The majority of recently proposed solutions for autonomous vehicle-to-human communication consist of introducing additional visual cues (such as lights, text and pictograms) on either the car’s exterior or as projections on the road. We argue that potential shortcomings in the visibility (due to light conditions, placement on the vehicle) and immediate understandability (learned, directive) {{of many of these}} cues make them alone insufficient in mediating multi-party interactions in the busy intersections of day-to-day traffic. Our observations of real-world human road user behavior in urban intersections indicate that movement in context is a central method of communication for coordination among drivers and pedestrians. The observed movement patterns gain meaning when seen within the context of road geometry, current road activity, and culture. While all movement communicates the intention of the driver, we highlight the use of movement as gesture, done for the specific purpose of communicating to other road users and give examples of how these influence <b>traffic</b> <b>interactions.</b> An awareness and understanding of the effect and importance of movement gestures in day-to-day <b>traffic</b> <b>interactions</b> is needed for developers of autonomous vehicles to design forms of human-vehicle communication that are effective and scalable in multi-party interactions...|$|R
40|$|Good {{characterization}} of traffic interactions among urban roads can facilitate traffic-related applications, such as traffic control and short-term forecasting. Most studies measure the <b>traffic</b> <b>interaction</b> between two roads by their topological distance or {{the correlation between}} their traffic variables. However, the distance-based methods neglect the spatial heterogeneity of roads’ traffic interactions, while the correlation-based methods cannot capture the non-linear dependency between two roads’ traffic variables. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Road 2 Vec to quantify the implicit traffic interactions among roads based on large-scale taxi operating route data using a Word 2 Vec model from the natural language processing (NLP) field. First, the analogy between transportation elements (i. e., road segment, travel route) and NLP terms (i. e., word, document) is established. Second, the real-valued vectors for road segments are trained from massive travel routes using the Word 2 Vec model. Third, the <b>traffic</b> <b>interaction</b> between any pair of roads {{is measured by the}} cosine similarity of their vectors. A case study on short-term traffic forecasting is conducted with artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to validate the advantages of the presented method. The results show that the forecasting achieves a higher accuracy {{with the support of the}} Road 2 Vec method than with the topological distance and traffic correlation based methods. We argue that the Road 2 Vec method can be effectively utilized for quantifying complex traffic interactions among roads and capturing underlying heterogeneous and non-linear properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} multimedia' {{applications}} depends primarily {{on how the}} different media are compressed, packetised, and transported over a network. Compression algorithms {{reduce the amount of}} data to be transmitted by removing redundancy in the media. Most of these algorithms are lossy, and can significantly degrade the media quality. Furt~ermore, degradations occur when packets are transported over lossy and unreliable networks such as the Internet. Due to the heterogeneous nature of multimedia <b>traffic,</b> complex <b>interactions</b> occur when they are transported over the same medium. This is true in packetswitched networks such as the Internet, where packet delivery is not guaranteed. Each traffic requires different treatment from the network transport services, which can have direct impact on other traffic. This thesis presents an evaluation of how multimedia traffic affect one another when transported over the same medium, for various network conditions.

The framework supports a cognitive control multimodality based on the crossing of two orthogonal dimensions: symbolic/subsymbolic; anticipative/reactive control. BI car drivers' behaviour was compared with that of a control group (CTRL) during driving simulator scenarios. Eye movement analysis, among other variables, revealed that BI car drivers made use of a more symbolic and reactive control than did CTRL drivers. CTRL drivers showed a more stable cognitive compromise than BI drivers. The latter became less symbolic and more reactive in the case of difficult scenarios.

30|$|The {{concept of}} gap {{acceptance}} {{is inherent in}} the <b>traffic</b> <b>interaction</b> which takes place when the minor-street vehicles enter the intersection merging into or crossing a traffic major stream. Gap acceptance models are aimed at representing to what extent the minor-street vehicles entering a roundabout {{will be able to use}} an acceptable gap between two consecutive vehicles in the major traffic stream. When a gap acceptance model is going to be developed, assumptions need to be made both for the psycho-technical headways (or the critical headway and the follow-up headway), and for the arrival headway distribution (or the distribution of the gaps between the vehicles in the different circulating streams), as well as for the distribution of traffic flows among the circulating lanes. The accuracy of the capacity estimation is primarily determined by the accuracy of the estimation of the critical headway and the follow-up headway. In calculation process, single mean values usually replace these random variables, disregarding their inherent variations, and thus providing a single-value of entry capacity. However, the model performance in predicting capacities can be limited, although when one is assessing the operational performance of an existing roundabout or deciding whether (or not) a roundabout should be planned, designed or built, an important role is played by the capacity estimations and level-of-service determinations. Hence, analysts would like to perform estimations as complete and correct as possible.|$|E

Traditionally, extensive attention has been given to accidents in the view of safety when studying occurrence frequency. The regularity of incident frequency, however, deserves equal attention by practitioners and researchers, especially on urban expressways with dense ramps and high traffic volume. The objective {{of this study was to}} have a thorough exploration of environmental and traffic-related causative factors of incident rate on three urban expressways in central Shanghai City, including disability incidents and crash incidents. Incident data obtained by CCTV-monitoring system were used, which contain large quantities of minor and short-duration incidents. The disaggregation of expressway sections and time intervals of this study was rare in its scope: disability frequency is analyzed on an hourly basis and segment-hour aggregation is applied for crash frequency. To account for temporal correlation among different time intervals, Generalized Estimation Equation procedure was used in this paper. In particular, the effects of <b>traffic</b> <b>interaction</b> features on incident occurrence were analyzed by considering segment length, merging and diverging volume. Results showed that temporal correlation of crash incident occurrence was larger than that of disability occurrence. There is a significant relationship of disability rate with rain and temperature, and there was more risk of vehicle disability in dense-traffic and low-speed condition. It also pointed out that the regularity of crash incident occurrence is quite different from that of accidents on highways or rural freeways: Environmental factors exert little impact on crash occurrence except from visibility; Short segment, high merging and diverging volume increased crash rate remarkably...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} brought great {{change in the}} {{telecommunication}} environment: Separate voice, video and data networks are being replaced by "broadband integrated service digital network" (B-ISDN) networks capable of supporting heterogeneous traffic. One possible protocol for implementation of B-ISDN is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Quality of Service (QoS) has become {{an important factor in}} the deployment of this next-generation of data networks. The continuing increase in the volume of data to be carried has boosted the need for efficient QoS administration. Although the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm is not specified by the International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications (ITU-T), it is still widely used to moderate bandwidth allocation, and User Parameter Control (UPC) algorithms can ensure that contractual stipulations are met. However, if an accurate QoS monitoring technique is implemented, both the CAC and UPC mechanisms will have a firmer foundation upon which to base their decisions. QoS monitoring will allow a network operator to take an action if deterioration in the network is detected. This research focuses on the use of data interpretation to monitor the QoS of source bursty traffic based upon delay. The author has studied the monitoring process in a simulated environment of sufficient detail to produce statistically significant results. This research employs the implementation of a purpose-built simulation of an ATM network, in which the QoS experienced by different monitored sources is monitored in the presence of heterogeneous cross-traffic. The results from this simulation provide a deeper understanding of <b>traffic</b> <b>interaction</b> in broadband networks. Techniques have been deivised, tested and validated for the monitoring of both Constant Bit rate (CBR) and Variable Bit rate (VBR) traffic.

In this paper, we consider a specific freeway weaving type, which is formed when an on ramp is near to an off ramp and these two ramps are joined by an auxiliary lane. <b>Traffic</b> <b>interactions</b> in this weaving zone are very complex due to the involvement of weaving flows and non-weaving flows in the so-called mandatory lane-changing process. To handle this complexity, {{it is essential to}} have a good understanding of the (microscopic) driving behavior within the weaving zones. These behaviors are modeled based on a gap-acceptance model. The methodology to obtain a weaving continuum traffic model is thus twofold.

The three best-characterized Rho family members are Cdc 42, RhoA and Rac 1. Cdc 42 regulates endocytosis, the transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi transport and exocytosis. Cdc 42 influences <b>trafficking</b> through <b>interaction</b> with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp 2 / 3 complex, leading to changes in actin dynamics. Rac 1 mediates endocytic and exocytic vesicle <b>trafficking</b> by <b>interaction</b> with its effectors, PI 3 kinase, synaptojanin 2, IQGAP 1 and phospholipase D 1. RhoA participates in the regulation of endocytosis through controlling its downstream target, Rho kinase.

With the option to modify the TCP implementation at the receivers we further propose TCP-WOW algorithm, which estimates the flow queue size on the forward path and further uses such estimates as quantitative indication of the congestion level to dynamically guide the congestion response. TCP-WOW is robust to reverse <b>traffic</b> <b>interactions.</b> TCP-WOW also shows a better RTT fairness and consistently good performance in our IEEE 802. 11 WLAN simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of managing {{air and space}} <b>traffic</b> <b>interactions</b> will increase as the frequency of commercial space operations increases in the future. It is desirable that commercial operators of both aircraft and spacecraft receive equitable access to the shared resource of the National Airspace System while maintaining {{a high level of}} safety by protecting air traffic from possible spacecraft malfunctions. Current operational practice is conservative, reserving large volumes of airspace over a substantial time window. Space transition corridors are 4 -dimensional envelopes, tailored to the trajectories of spacecraft during their launch and reentry flight phases, that provide a safety buffer without imposing excessive re-routing/delay costs on air traffic. Corridors with various spatial and temporal parameters were modeled in a simulation study, using air traffic re-routing distance as a performance metric. It was found that distance penalty contours can provide a basis for conducting tradeoffs within a corridor’s temporal design space (time window duration vs. window midpoint time). A tool based on these contours could be useful for launch and reentry planning to reduce re-routing/delay costs for aircraft flying in the vicinity of spaceports while maintaining safety...|$|R
