40|$|The {{excess of}} noise {{in large cities}} is a {{recurrent}} situation which creates irritability, loss of efficiency at work and loss of life quality, in such way that the silence and the tranquility of smaller cities {{end up being a}} touristic appeal. But, at the same time, the touristic activities have great potential of generating noise energy, which leads to a conflicting situation. The city of Campos de Jordão, nationally known for its cool climate, European architecture and sophisticated gastronomy, is popular among people who seek both tranquility and entertainment. The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the urban impact created by the increase of noise energy due to touristic activities in the city of Campos do Jordão. Thus, measurement of sound pressure levels were carried out on holidays and working days in 15 chosen spots. The results showed a considerable elevation of noise levels, even in areas away from touristic zones.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, Ben Jebli et al. (2015 a) was the first paper {{studying}} the dynamic causal relationships between tourism and renewable energy consumption, more precisely combustible renewables and waste consumption. They employ the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to investigate the causal relationship between GDP, combustible renewables and waste (CRW) consumption, CO 2 emissions, and international tourism for the case of Tunisia. They show the presence of short-run unidirectional causality running from GDP and CRW to international tourism, while there is long-run bidirectional causality between all considered variables. Long-run parameter estimates indicate that CRW consumption increases international tourism, while both CRW consumption and international tourism increase CO 2 emissions and GDP. These authors recommend that Tunisia should use more CRW energy, because this contributes to eliminate wastes from <b>touristic</b> <b>zones,</b> while it increases both the number of tourist arrivals and GDP. Our contribution in the present paper comes from studying the dynamic interaction between renewable energy and tourism and their long-run impact on CO 2 emissions using dynamic panel cointegration methods and a panel of Central and South American countries.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{enlighten}} the role second home owners can play within the dynamic of touristic coastal territories. Under the rising globalization, coastal zones are generally concerned with an important economic and demographic attractiveness. Second homes play a major part in this coastal pressure, first of all because of their number. In many cities, not only second homes form an important part of the housing stock, but they also represent numerous touristic accommodations and contribute to the local economy. Second homes owners are a hybrid population: somewhere between inhabitants and tourists, they are an example of new arts of dwelling and the mobility in our modern societies. They are also the subject of considerable debate and controversy. We assume that, far from being “secondary”, this population takes a full part in their territories dynamics, especially in coastal and <b>touristic</b> <b>zones.</b> Our research group has conducted a methodological reflection in order to launch a pioneering study about second homes owners’ habits in Charente-Maritime. France being the first destination of international tourism, Charente-Maritime is the second touristic region in the country in terms of visits. As tourism represents the first economy in Charente-Maritime, the study leans on a significant partnership between La Rochelle University and local institutional and economic stakeholders. Thanks to this study, an important database has been built, and will be broadened in 2014 as the survey extends to all territories of Charente-Maritime.

The research effectuated mainly used empirical data from the United States, North and West Europe as well as East Asia, while a relative lack in papers is observed with regard to data coming from other touristic zones, like the Mediterranean, which, according to the EU is visited by nearly 30 % Sata A.

Furthermore {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the potential of Perceived Information Technology Beliefs, in combination with the employees ’ particular personal and individual characteristics, which are included in the Personal Characteristics and Subjective Norms factors, through a TAM, to affect Behavioural Intention (BI) to accept and use the Information Technologies (IT). Our findings, with the exception of the (non-significance) of Self-Efficacy, suggest that, in the Greek Tourism Sector, the harmonization of Personal Characteristics together with the other driving factors positively contributes, through a TAM, to the enhancement of Behavioural Intention; consequently, one of the first policy measures in the Sector should be the expansion of staff training in Informatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{time domain}} {{electromagnetic}} method (TDEM) {{is applied to}} monitor, to delineate and to map the saltwater intrusion zones in the Mediterranean Plio-Quaternary aquifer. Forty-two TDEM soundings were {{carried out in the}} coastal plain of Nabeul-Hammamet region (NE Tunisia). TDEM resistivity data were correlated with the existing borehole logging data to assign them to a particular lithology and to provide information about the position of the freshwater-seawater transition zone. The geoelectric sections showing the vertical configuration of seawater intrusion, with the brackish-salty-saturated zones, have a resistivity ranging from ~ 0. 1 to 5 Ω{dot operator}m and are detected at a depth lower than 1. 5 m. The salinized zones are located at Nabeul (Sidi Moussa, Sidi El Mahrsi, Al Gasba and Mrazgua) and at Hammamet (<b>Touristic</b> <b>zone</b> of Hammamet north and south, Baraket Essahel) and reached a distance of 4 km from the coastline, indicating a severe state for the aquifer in these zones. These TDEM results are confirmed by the increase of chloride concentration content in the analysed water samples of monitoring wells. Moreover, in the northeastern part, the presence of a saltwater front located far from the coast and along the NW-SE major surface fault can be explained by two hypothesis: (i) this fault seems to provide a conduit for seawater to move readily towards the water wells and (ii) the clay and gypsum infiltration of marine Messinian deposits through the fault plane leads to low resistivities. Finally, it comes out from this study that TDEM survey has successfully depicted salinized zones of this coastal aquifer...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{employs the}} autoregressive {{distributed}} lag (ARDL) bounds methodological approach {{to investigate the}} relationship between economic growth, combustible renewables and waste consumption, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, and international tourism for the case of Tunisia spanning the period 1990 – 2010. The results from the Fisher statistic of both the Wald test and the Johansen test confirm {{the presence of a}} long-run relationship among the variables under investigation. The stability of estimated parameters has been tested, while Granger causality tests recommend a short-run unidirectional causality running from economic growth and combustible renewables and waste consumption to CO 2 emissions, a bidirectional causality between economic growth and combustible renewables and waste consumption and unidirectional causality running from economic growth and combustible renewables and waste consumption to international tourism. In the long-run, the error correction terms confirm the presence of bidirectional causality relationships between economic growth, CO 2 emissions, combustible renewables and waste consumption, and international tourism. Our long-run estimates show that combustible renewables and waste consumption increases international tourism, and both renewables and waste consumption and international tourism increase CO 2 emissions and output. We recommend that (i) Tunisia should use more combustible renewables and waste energy as this eliminates wastes from <b>touristic</b> <b>zones</b> and increases the number of tourist arrivals, leading to economic growth, and (ii) a fraction of this economic growth generated by the increase in combustible renewables and waste consumption should be invested in clean renewable energy production (i. e., solar, wind, geothermal) and energy efficiency projects...|$|R

40|$|When we {{talk about}} the Serbian <b>touristic</b> <b>zones,</b> what we usually have in mind and what we point out are the mountainous zones of the {{national}} parks. But there exists a plain zone with exceptional natural potentials for the development of eco-tourism. Still adequate attention has not been paid to it neither performed an appropriate touristic evaluation. We are talking about the zone of POSAVINA. A big, navigable river, numerous meanders, river islands, effluents, marshes and swamps rich in flora and fauna, create a remarkable natural environment, quite close to the big cities and international highways that has not been adequately evaluated in the fields of ecotourism. This study is a result of our intention to pay public attention to the natural potentials for the formation of an ecotouristic zone in the lower Posavina in Serbia, which {{is at the same time}} the most beautiful and in the ecological sense the most interesting part of the river Sava. In this section (206. 5 km) Sava is very much alike a winding thread beaded with fantastic marsh terrains with rare floral and animal species, which are typical for this kind of biothop. Posavina in Serbia contains a whole chain of attractive zones and places, from the hunting forest of Bosut and Morović to the Ada Ciganlija. Natural complexes in their original state or slightly changed are an important eco-tourist resource in Posavina. They all should be to keep ecological balance, but at the same time to satisfied the rising ecological needs. Though some natural objects are protected, still it is not enough, and “the touristic digression”, i. e. degradation of environment, is higher and higher. In future ecostrategic planning, Posavina should be treated systematically, as a single ecotouristic zone. The red line of this zone is the river Sava that could be transformed into a single water ecopath. As a conclusion we could say that a complete protection of all marsh and water ecosystems in Posavina is needed not only as a widening of the tourist resource’s basis but also as a creation of an entire system of protection of flora and fauna (especially birds) world, as a basic natural recreation-touristic resource. Ecotourism of marshes and swamps (and of mountains as well) could become a touristic image of Serbia. Tourist destinations in Posavina can be tempting even up to the European standards. But this requires Sava to be accepted as a national eco-path and the integral solving of the ecological problems of Posavina. Only the ecological tourism can be profitable and at same time possible over a long period of time in the zone of Posavina...|$|R

40|$|The {{direction}} of the sea waves is a difficult parameter to measure on the coast because the wave transformation process can redistribute the energy in very different directions {{with respect to the}} incident waves from deep waters. A practical way to estimate the wave direction is using numeric techniques i. e. the inverse method, which consists in backward ray tracing (inverse refraction), obtaining the inverse direction function and the swell’s refracted wave directional spectrum a fixed point in shallow water to deep water. The inverse method was used to estimate the wave directions of distant swell that can potentially arrive with high energy to the important <b>touristic</b> <b>zone</b> of Playa Miramar, Tamaulipas, characterizing the swell according to wind conditions, such as, calm, average, cold front and storm. In this work, the convention used for directions, is that indicating the azimuth from the incoming waves. In general, the calculated directional swell spectra, it can be suggested that the directions with high wave energy that approximate from sea range between from 100 ° to 160 ° (quadrant ENE-SSE approximately) and arrive to Playa Miramar between 108 ° and 130 °. Additionally, the range of the numerically directions obtained for Playa Miramar, as well as the range of discussed frequencies were compared with the corresponding from virtual buoys that represent numeric results from the WAVEWATCH-III model of wave propagation. The results from these comparisons are that the interval of directions obtained (15 ° – 130 °) is localized within the corresponding to virtual buoys (0 ° – 174 °), while that range frequencies considerate are localized outside of the buoys (0. 097 Hz – 0. 380 Hz) for low frequencies...|$|E
