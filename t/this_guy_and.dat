"Basically, it's {{kind of like}} a ladies' night 'cause it's all us {{females and}} the song is about {{basically}} all these temptations you have with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> you're kind of fighting it.

500|$|Conn Smythe {{realized}} {{the importance of}} finding the right line-mates for Kennedy, telling coach Hap Day in September 1945, [...] "we must get something really rapid to team up with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> we'll be set for a decade with a first rate front line." [...] Smythe's first attempt was to acquire future Hockey Hall of Famer Edgar Laprade, {{at the time a}} star in senior hockey whose rights were owned by the New York Rangers. A deal could not be made as New York General Manager Lester Patrick was asking for several players in return.|$|E
500|$|The artwork of Royal Robertson, {{a self-proclaimed}} prophet from Louisiana, {{was used for}} the album's cover and interior. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said that Sufjan Stevens uses the artwork [...] "as a {{springboard}} for music that evokes a visionary psyche." [...] Stevens became interested in the work of Robertson after recording music for a friend's documentary on the artist, and said that [...] ", the more I felt a weird affinity to <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> the story of his life." [...] He began to transcribe some of the text that appears in Robertson's artwork, and says this process stayed with him a [...] "long time" [...] and [...] "that some of it started to come up in the lyrics, in the songs I was writing.|$|E

500|$|Fagerbakke {{has been}} {{compared}} to Patrick's character, which he concurs with. Kenny said that [...] "Bill [...] is a big guy. The world is almost too small for him. He's a force of nature, like Patrick." [...] Writer Jay Lender said, describing Fagerbakke in the recording studio, [...] "Bill Fagerbakke is the most thoughtful performer I've ever seen in the booth—he was always asking questions and really {{trying to get into the}} mindset, such as it is, of Patrick." [...] Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke, [...] "He is <b>this</b> big <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> he plays Patrick so well. He's just <b>this</b> big <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> he lumbers around." [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "I'm clumsy. I'm goofy. I make mistakes all the time" [...] and agreed that [...] "I guess I'm a lot of Patrick." ...|$|R
500|$|Gabby West, who won {{the second}} season of Scream Queens, plays Kara in the film. [...] Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist of the {{alternative}} rock band Linkin Park, has {{a role in the}} film playing Evan, a white power skinhead. Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult than I expected because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ". Devon Bostick was offered to reprise his role as Brent from Saw VI, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{acknowledged}} {{that from a}} musical stand point someone who inspires you creatively and acts as your muse, is a special bond. She attributed it to Liam's feelings for Ruby. Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another. As the scholarship develops they {{talk to each other}} about [...] "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship." [...] Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp. Breeds said [...] "She sees them flirting and she has a moment where she realises that she's so in love with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> it's kind of now or never. She needs to take action." [...] True to Ruby's persona she does not preconceive her actions and Ruby feels she has to [...] "set the record straight and to give it a really good crack." [...] For Ruby it is a spontaneous, impromptu moment; [...] "She's just totally spilling out with feelings for him." ...|$|E

What you want is {{to get rid of}} <b>this</b> fresh <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> have all the papers in a certain vault {{destroyed}}. You see to it that only the papers you want destroyed are in that vault, and I'll do the rest." ...|$|R

500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017, Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis {{indicated}} that the band would likely want to work again with Danger Mouse on the follow-up to The Getaway. Kiedis [...] "I think it's good {{to work with the}} same guy again to um, you know you had your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> see what we can accomplish." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>guy</b> {{approached}} me <b>and</b> {{asked me what}} time it was and then asked for my seat. When I refused he then went back to his seat {{at the back of the}} bus. Then an hour later he came up with a small knife or pocketknife and just reached around and slit the driver's throat.|$|R
2500|$|On March 18, 2017, Kiedis gave an {{interview}} with a Vancouver radio station and indicated that for band's next album they were likely to work with Danger Mouse again as their producer. [...] "I think it's good to work with the same guy again to um, you know you had your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> see what we can accomplish" [...] Kiedis said.|$|E
2500|$|The Thing-Fish {{characterization}} {{was performed}} by Ike Willis, who helped shaped the dialogue himself using African American Vernacular English According to Willis, [...] "in my family, we sort of joke around with dialects, and what it sounded like to me was [...] Paul Laurence Dunbar. [...] I asked Frank if he {{had ever heard of}} <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> he said, 'No,' so I started giving him examples of Dunbar's work, and eventually, that ended up being a big influence on the Thing-Fish dialect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Selma Blair as Liz Sherman: A pyrokinetic {{member of}} BPRD and Hellboy's girlfriend. Blair {{described}} her character as more {{engaging in the}} sequel, [...] "In the first one {{she was afraid to}} take a step. She was completely a zombie, not wanting to own up to her power and having the memory of what she'd created in her life... I was really eager to come and play Liz with a little more vibrancy." [...] Blair also had short hair for her role, avoiding long hair from her portrayal in the first film, which she felt [...] "brought her face down". The actress emphasized Liz Sherman's growth in the sequel, [...] "She's looking to the future much more, and things are happening in this one that she has to buck up... I think you're dealing with a lot knowing this young girl that we last saw as very damaged, and now she's with <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> all these people around her, I think, we've really had to step up a strength, and a confidence in her so that I don't look like the little baby kid sister tagging along." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guy {{appears in}} the American Street Fighter {{animated}} series in an episode titled [...] "Final Fight", which adapts the plot of its namesake. In <b>this</b> episode, <b>Guy</b> <b>and</b> Cody befriend Ryu and Ken, who aid them in fighting the Mad Gear Gang to save Jessica. He also makes an appearance in [...] {{as one of the}} warriors who have agreed to accompany Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li to Professor Sadler's base and rescue Shun, Ryu's alleged brother. As the fighters battle each other outside Sadler's base to demonstrate their skills, Guy fights Dhalsim.

2500|$|Becker and Fagen met in 1967 at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. As Fagen {{passed by}} a café, The Red Balloon, he heard Becker {{practicing}} the electric guitar. In an interview, Fagen recounted the experience: [...] "I hear <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> practicing, <b>and</b> it sounded very professional and contemporary. It sounded like, you know, like a black person, really." [...] He introduced himself to Becker and asked, [...] "Do {{you want to be}} in a band?" [...] Discovering that they enjoyed similar music, the two began writing songs together.|$|R
5000|$|James Williamson of Iggy and the Stooges has said, “I {{was over}} at Capitol Records and as I {{was going out}} I was {{watching}} <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> recording <b>and</b> it was Scott Thurston with this other band. He was cool, I could hear {{that he was a}} great piano player, so I got his contact info and I said, 'You wanna play with us?' When we put the band Iggy and the Stooges back together, I asked him if he wanted to play with us, and he said, 'Sure,' and the rest is history." ...|$|R
2500|$|All of {{the explosions}} {{in the movie}} were filmed in one shot, {{as opposed to a}} typical film where each would have been covered by {{multiple}} cameras. Russell explained, [...] "to me that's more real. The car's blowing up on <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> we just park the camera. Of course the producer says, 'we gotta run three cameras!' But if I cut three ways, then it just looks like an action picture." [...] Russell also had the Foley department tone down the sounds of gunfire, saying he didn't want to [...] "Bruce Willis-ize" [...] the film." [...] One frequently noted shot in the film is an image of a bullet piercing a number of internal organs, releasing bile into the abdominal cavity, used when Gates is describing sepsis as the effect of a gunshot wound. This internal camera is again used when SFC Barlow is shot in the torso and his chest begins to fill with air, crushing his lung. Both of these scenes were inspired by Russell asking an emergency room doctor friend [...] "What's the weirdest wound you've ever seen?" [...] It also erupted a minor controversy, when Russell began to joke around that the gunshots were fired into a real corpse; a statement everyone vehemently denied later.|$|E
2500|$|Frey {{came up with}} a {{cinematic}} {{scenario of}} a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered [...] "a weird world peopled by freaky characters", and became [...] "quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape." [...] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song [...] "to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone", and added: [...] "We take <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door there’s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie." [...] Frey described the song in an interview with NBC's Bob Costas as a cinematic montage [...] "just one shot to the next ... a picture of a guy on the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people." [...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create something strange, just {{to see if we could}} do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E

Ramsay's wife was also concerned about his safety and instructed him to take self-defense classes.|$|R
5000|$|Neal is {{a people}} person. His {{confidence}} {{makes it easy}} for him to con people (particularly women), and he frequently draws attention to himself wherever he goes.

Because <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is elegant, <b>and</b> he’s sophisticated, and he’s smart and he loves the attention." ...|$|R

500|$|While Larson {{was running}} up the score, the show's {{producers}} contacted Michael Brockman, then head of CBS's daytime programming department.

The play hinges on us not really being sure who <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is <b>and</b> Mr. Cummings manages to stay {{one step ahead}} of us without telegraphing what's coming next. At the play's dramatic climax, he reveals the play's soul to be an impassioned plea for what it really takes to be an artist. His performance is worth the 90 minutes." ...|$|R
