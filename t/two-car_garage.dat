500|$|The single's lyrics cover {{a variety}} of issues, ranging from [...] "body image, class division, an unhappy {{marriage}} and alcoholism". [...] "Ugly" [...] opens with Fantasia narrating a tragic story about {{a woman with a}} “picket fence, <b>two-car</b> <b>garage</b> and a man that she don’t love”. The narrative's rural setting is established through the lyrics, “Gimme that rusty old grain silo”. Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank you for that good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give me good food that sticks to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song. [...] "Ugly" [...] ends with Fantasia discussing her life immediately after winning the third season of American Idol.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Rutherford spent {{winters in}} San Diego, California, for health reasons, and [...] "in time, a direct {{contribution}} {{was made for}} the purpose of constructing a house in San Diego for brother Rutherford's use". The property was acquired in October 1929 by Robert J Marten and was given to Rutherford in December for the nominal fee of $10 (current equivalent $). The house was built in that year. Rutherford named the property Beth Sarim and dedicated it {{for the use of the}} expected Old Testament [...] "princes", who were now expected to be headquartered in San Diego instead of Jerusalem. The deed for Beth Sarim, written by Rutherford, said that the property was to be held [...] "perpetually in trust" [...] for the Old Testament [...] "princes" [...] and was to be surrendered to them once they arrived. It was located in the Kensington Heights section of San Diego over an area of about , landscaped with olive, date, and palm trees so that the [...] "princes" [...] would [...] "feel at home".

50|$|Bemiston {{was founded}} in 1927, as a mill town built around the Bemis Brothers Bag Company cotton mill. The mill was built between Alabama State Route 21 and the Eastern Alabama Railway. The 700,000-square-foot mill {{produced}} handbags during the Great Depression and sandbags during World War II. The community was home to a school, general store, automobile repair shop, nurses' office, and gymnasium. The company built a power plant and sewer and water treatment plant to serve the community. A recreational director was hired to develop a community baseball and basketball team.

50|$|The University District's 1,200 {{single family}} homes were built mainly during the “golden age of housing” from 1925-1930 and 1937-1941, when {{construction}} technology was highly developed, building costs were low, and old world craftsmen were in plentiful supply. The homes reflect {{a wide variety}} of styles: English Tudor, Romanesque, Italianate, Spanish Mission, French Provincial, Queen Anne, Georgian, Federalist, Art Moderne, and contemporary. The predominant Tudor style, consistent setbacks, rear-of-lot garages, and mature shade trees provide a coherent design aesthetic that gives the University District its distinctive visual identity. Interior features include intricate plasterwork, leaded or stained glass windows, oak paneled libraries, hand-pegged hardwood floors, one or more fireplaces, Pewabic Pottery tile, and crystal chandeliers. Most homes offer four to six bedrooms, a minimum of three bathrooms, <b>two-car</b> <b>garages,</b> and a fully finished basement that includes a furnace room, laundry room, fitness room and a large family room with wet bar and fireplace. Many of these family rooms have now been converted to home theaters.|$|R

50|$|The {{story of}} Lake Arbor {{is emblematic of}} the {{socio-economic}} and demographic evolution of Prince George's County {{that occurred in the}} mid-1980s. Against the strong resistance of many large national builders who perceived Prince George’s County as a price-sensitive retreat for urban African Americans who neither wanted nor could afford upscale amenities for their homes, Gary S. Lachman contractually required features like <b>two-car</b> <b>garages,</b> brick, and elaborate landscaping from builders who purchased lots in this community. To the pleasant surprise of the builders, buyers rushed to embrace (and pay for) these features. Firmly demonstrating both the sophisticated tastes and buying power of the predominantly African American market, as well as codifying architectural standards requested (but not mandated) by county executives such as Winnie Kelly and Governor Parris Glendening, Lake Arbor established Prince George’s County as the most desirable destination for young, affluent African American families moving from Washington, DC for a suburban lifestyle.|$|R

50|$|Andrew J. Thomas was {{selected}} architect for the Forest Hill neighborhood, an ambitious planned community {{to be built}} in part of John D. Rockefeller's estate in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, which his son had bought in 1923. It was expected to be a model of urban development targeting young professionals and executives of Standard Oil. The development was to include apartments and a commercial sector, including the Heights Rockefeller Building, a commercial and office building, which was completed by early 1930. 600 houses would be built to a small number of models, placed in pairs that mirrored each other. The houses were conceived as a village of Norman farmhouses, but were built to the highest standards of the day using the best materials, with innovations such as first-floor laundry rooms, basement living space where the children could play and multiple bathrooms. The houses had basement-level <b>two-car</b> <b>garages,</b> often sharing a driveway between two houses. The houses were landscaped before going on the market, and the property deeds included strict limitations on visible external changes such as fences and outbuildings. African Americans and Jewish people were not at first allowed to purchase houses. Construction began at the end of 1929, but most work stopped from 1931 to 1938 during the Depression. Only 81 of the planned 600 houses were actually built. In 1986, they were placed in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
