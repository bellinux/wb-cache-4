5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} of <b>the</b> <b>square</b> led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants {{was completed}} in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between <b>the</b> <b>square</b> and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E

This defines the derivative function of <b>the</b> <b>squaring</b> function, or just the derivative of <b>the</b> <b>squaring</b> function for short.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of <b>the</b> <b>square</b> as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around <b>the</b> <b>square</b> were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. <b>The</b> <b>square</b> languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Designed as the {{commercial}} heart of San Marco, <b>the</b> <b>square</b> had declined seriously by the 1970s, with many businesses closing. The original, compass-themed fountain was demolished. In the 1990s the City of Jacksonville undertook a major renovation and streetscaping project, which included restoring the fountain with three lion statues {{inspired by the}} Piazza San Marco. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>square</b> has become a popular commercial destination with many shops, restaurants and bars. In 2013 <b>the</b> <b>square</b> underwent another renovation project that rerouted the streets and expanded the small park in the center, named Balis Park, into a larger pedestrian green space.|$|E

5|$|Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. <b>The</b> <b>square</b> gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels {{started to move}} in, and by the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels.

5|$|Soho {{is an area}} first {{developed}} in the 1670s which, since the construction of theatres along Shaftesbury Avenue in the 19th century, has had a strong association with the entertainment industry.

From 1748 <b>the</b> <b>square</b> had as it centrepiece an equestrian figure of George I, but this deteriorated and was sold off {{at the beginning of the}} following century. In 1874 <b>the</b> <b>square</b> was bought by Albert Grant, a company promoter and MP, who had its gardens made over to a design by James Knowles. In this refurbishment the Shakespeare fountain and busts of four historical residents of the locale were installed, the latter positioned near the sites of their former homes.
