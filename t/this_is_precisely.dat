25|$|The Constitution gives {{each state}} {{legislature}} {{the power to}} decide how its state's electors are chosen {{and it can be}} easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a legislative framework for holding elections to determine the electors. As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: bicameral legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{take the}} given rng R, {{and make a}} {{category}} E whose objects are rng homomorphisms R → S, with S a ring having a multiplicative identity. The morphisms in E between R → S1 and R → S2 are commutative triangles of the form (R → S1,R → S2, S1 → S2) where S1 → S2 is a ring map (which preserves the identity). Note that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> {{the definition of the}} comma category of R over the inclusion of unitary rings into rng. The existence of a morphism between R → S1 and R → S2 implies that S1 is at least as efficient a solution as S2 to our problem: S2 can have more adjoined elements and/or more relations not imposed by axioms than S1.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to envision the bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience with the client and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> what enables the therapist and the client to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others as best they can. Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sensitive}} class of detector uses laser interferometry to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses. This allows the masses {{to be separated}} by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage {{is that it is}} sensitive {{to a wide range of}} frequencies (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is LIGO — the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana, one at the Hanford site in Richland, Washington and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to India. Each observatory has two light storage arms that are 4kilometers in length. These are at 90degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive.|$|E

25|$|The Palo Alto Flood Basin was {{constructed}} in 1956 {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of the floods of 1955, when a high tide prevented the escape of heavy runoff from Matadero, Adobe, and Barron Creeks into the San Francisco Bay. The trapped runoff waters overflowed upstream creek banks and caused severe flooding in Palo Alto. In order to control the flow of water into the flood basin, a tidegate was placed at the confluence of Adobe Creek, Matadero Creek, and the San Francisco Bay, so that the flood basin could be maintained at approximately 2 feet below sea level, creating room to absorb floodwaters. The tidegate consists of several weirs and one operator-controlled sluice gate that enables tidal flows into the basin in order to improve water quality and for mosquito control. Three agencies oversee the tidegates: Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County Vector Control. Because the trash grate and weirs separate the mouth of the flood basin from the San Francisco Bay estuary, large fish cannot swim freely between the Bay and the basin, unless the sluice gate is open. In addition, the tidegates are set to reduce tidal inflows into the basin, so that the basin is mostly freshwater. After a rainstorm the tidegate is kept closed, however <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> when steelhead trout in-migrations should occur. In 2002 a small opening was cut in the trash grate on the tidal gate to permit fish passage but local fisherman in the Flood Basin no longer report catching steelhead trout in recent years.|$|E
500|$|There are {{difficulties}} in {{deciding how to}} allocate the revenues raised. This is a controversial issue among scholars. The revenues {{can be used to}} improve public transport (as is the case in London), or to invest in new road infrastructure (as in Oslo).

Congestion pricing is not intended to increase public revenues or to become just another tax, however <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> one of the main concerns of road users and taxpayers.|$|E

500|$|James O. Freedman, {{the former}} {{president}} of Dartmouth College, the University of Iowa, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, has defended Dershowitz: I do not understand [...] charge of plagiarism against Alan Dershowitz. There is no claim that Dershowitz used the words of others without attribution. When he uses the words of others, he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources (Mark Twain, Palestine Royal Commission, etc.) [...] complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source, in which Dershowitz may have come upon them. But as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: 'Importance of attribution. With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This not only bolsters the claims of fair use, it also helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism.' <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> what Dershowitz did.|$|E
500|$|Since the band's 1960s heyday, the {{influence}} of the Byrds on successive generations of rock and pop musicians has grown steadily, with acts such as the Eagles, Big Star, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Bangles, the Smiths, and innumerable alternative rock bands of the post-punk era all exhibiting signs of their influence. [...] Musician and author Peter Lavezzoli described the Byrds in 2007 as [...] "one of the few bands to exert a decisive influence on the Beatles", while also noting that they helped to persuade Bob Dylan to begin recording with electric instrumentation. [...] Lavezzoli concluded that [...] "like it or not, terms like [...] "folk rock," [...] "raga rock" [...] and [...] "country rock" [...] were coined for a reason: the Byrds did it first, and then kept moving, never staying in the [...] "raga" [...] or [...] "country" [...] mode for very long. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> what made the Byrds such a rewarding band to follow from one record to the next." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the {{polarization}} of religion {{viewed in the}} episode, noting that [...] "although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic—and distorted view of religion." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I {{have always been the}} type of person who admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> the mindset I'm feeling after watching 'Signs and Wonders'. I admire the attempt to spook me, to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness, even if I'm not completely sure what the point of it all was." [...] Nevertheless, Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode's occasional quips of humor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+". Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were [...] "surprisingly horrifying" [...] and that the episode contained [...] "plenty [...] to recommend", he was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey. Although he had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes, he wrote that the [...] "last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going, and in a way that hurts everything that came before." ...|$|E
