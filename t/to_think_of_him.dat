500|$|While in high school, Garland {{also played}} Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) {{basketball}} with the Philly Pride. Amauro Austin, a statistician for the Philadelphia Daily News, directed the program while Garland was there. Austin commented, [...] "Everybody liked Ty. Not one person didn't. He was loyal, honest; just a solid-gold individual. He didn't have a malicious {{bone in his}} body". Garland often slept {{during the day and}} stayed awake at night, leading his peers <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a vampire. Before becoming a senior, he led the Pride to sixth place at the under-17 national AAU tournament in Orlando, Florida. The team finished with an 8–1 record due largely to Garland's contributions.|$|E
500|$|Dissenting {{from the}} general tone of praise for Bewick, Jacob Kainen cites claims that [...] "many of the best tailpieces in the History of British birds were drawn by Robert Johnson", and that [...] "the greater number of those {{contained}} in the second volume were engraved by Clennell. Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions, {{the fact that the}} results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius." [...] Kainen argues that while competent, Bewick [...] "was no Holbein, no Botticelli—it is absurd <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in such terms—but he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving." ...|$|E

Driver said the team tried [...] "not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as being bad, or evil, or a villain. Something that was more three-dimensional. He's more dangerous and unpredictable, and morally justified in doing what he thinks is right." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Superman/Batman #3 (Dec. 2003), Batman, under writer Jeph Loeb, observes, [...] "It is a {{remarkable}} dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then... he shoots fire from the skies, {{and it is difficult}} not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to 'him'." [...] In writer Geoff Johns' Infinite Crisis #1 (Dec. 2005), part of the 2005–2006 [...] "Infinite Crisis" [...] crossover storyline, Batman admonishes him for identifying with humanity too much and failing to provide the strong leadership that superhumans need.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Adams as Dr. Daniel Goodman (season 1): An {{archaeologist}} turned administrator, who is {{the director}} of the Jeffersonian Institute. He is a loving husband and father to a pair of five-year-old twin girls. His way of working leads Hodgins <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as subjective, long-winded, and lacking the qualities of a pure scientist, although the antagonism between the two develops into a friendly rivalry as the season progresses. He has not made any appearances beyond season one. As of episode 23, [...] "The Titan on the Tracks", he is said to be on sabbatical, and is never seen for the rest of the series.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Steiger {{decided to}} run for the U.S. Senate seat opened up by Paul Fannin's retirement. [...] His {{opponent}} during the Republican primary was fellow congressman John Bertrand Conlan. [...] The campaign between the two congressmen became ugly with Conlan saying [...] "We are both conservatives, but our style is different. He uses a meat ax and I use a scalpel" [...] and asking voters if they desired [...] "a Jew from New York telling Arizona what to do". [...] Steiger countered with [...] "John thinks of himself as a scalpel. I prefer <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a Roto-Rooter," [...] and claiming [...] "Godzilla would make a better Senator than John Conlan." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Almanac House, Guthrie added {{authenticity}} {{to their}} work, {{since he was}} a [...] "real" [...] working class Oklahoman. [...] "There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance", a friend of the group, Irwin Silber, would say. Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores. House member Agnes [...] "Sis" [...] Cunningham, another Okie, would later recall that Woody [...] "loved people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a real working class person and not an intellectual". Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger's post-Almanac Singers project People's Songs, a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers, founded in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Before every wire walk, Wallenda joins {{his family}} in prayer and he always wears a cross as he performs. He remarks, [...] "The Bible says pray without ceasing and I'm always praying." [...] He denies that his stunts [...] "test" [...] God. [...] "To test God would be to never train, never practice, and then to walk across the Grand Canyon; or to jump off a building, or throw myself {{in front of a}} truck," [...] he says. [...] Wallenda says he tries to live [...] "an upright life" [...] and be a good example. Despite his success, Wallenda wants people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as just a regular guy. [...] "I want people to like me, just for who I am," [...] he says. [...] "What you get is a regular person. I want people to relate to me." [...] Friends {{described}} him as a lighthearted guy who is always cracking jokes.|$|E
2500|$|On September 19, 2012, NPRs Drew Toal {{reviewed}} the book, reiterating Simon's astonishment {{at the impact}} that Dumas made in life and literature, and calling the book and life of Dumas [...] "fascinating". He compared the historical influence of Dumas with his offspring, stating he was [...] "larger-than-life" [...] and that [...] "the sword was mightier than the pen" [...] for this father of a famous novelist. While acknowledging the military impact that Dumas made in France, along with the inspiration his life provided as a backdrop in literature throughout history, Toal {{was surprised at the}} level of enthusiasm the author expressed about his subject. [...] "I like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as history's ultimate underdog," [...] Reiss had explained in his earlier NPR interview. [...] "He's a black man, born into slavery, and then he rises higher than any black man rose in a white society before our own time. He became a four-star general and challenges Napoleon, and he did it all 200 years ago, at the height of slavery." [...] In the end, Toal summed up his review, stating, [...] "Despite Reiss' sometimes overblown regard, it's difficult to argue with him. That a former slave could rise on his merits so far, so fast some seven decades before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation is a truly amazing story, one that needs no literary embellishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kon-El, {{the modern}} Superboy, is a clone created from the {{combined}} genetic material of the Man of Steel and Lex Luthor. He arrived in Metropolis shortly after Superman's death. Originally, {{he had no}} name besides [...] "Superman". When the original Superman returned, he declared that the clone had earned the name [...] "Superboy", much to his dismay. Superboy eventually became a hero is his own right, and Superman came <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as family, giving him the Kryptonian name of Kon-El and the human alias Conner Kent, cousin to Clark. Originally Kon-El's origins were depicted as being created from genetically altered human DNA and {{made to look like}} Superman and to be as Kryptonian as possible, manipulating Superman's bio-electric aura into a telekinetic field, but eventually this was retconned so that 50% of his DNA actually does come from Superman (despite Cadmus earlier concluding that this was impossible due to the far greater complexity of Kryptonian DNA). They also learned that the genetically altered human DNA came from Luthor, rather than Paul Westfield as initially stated by Cadmus. In a future depicted in the Titans Tomorrow story arc, Conner becomes a tyrannical Superman after Kal-El dies again. Although Conner died during the Infinite Crisis (2006), his future self, as Superman, is part of a story arc in Teen Titans, published in late 2007. The second Titans Tomorrow Conner is Tim Drake's clone of the original. The first Conner returned to life during the events of Final Crisis in the story Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds and remained active within the DC universe up until The New 52 reboot, where he is once again just beginning his career as a super hero.|$|E
