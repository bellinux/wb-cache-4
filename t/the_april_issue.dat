5|$|By 1938, with Amazings {{circulation}} down to only 15,000, Teck Publications {{was having}} financial problems. In January 1938 Ziff-Davis {{took over the}} magazine and shortly thereafter moved production to Chicago; <b>the</b> <b>April</b> <b>issue</b> was assembled by Sloane but published by Ziff-Davis. Bernard Davis, who ran Ziff-Davis's editorial department, attempted to hire Roger Sherman Hoar as editor; Hoar turned down the job but suggested Raymond A. Palmer, an active local science fiction fan. Palmer was hired that February, taking over editorial duties with the June 1938 issue. Ziff-Davis launched Fantastic Adventures, a fantasy companion to Amazing, in May 1939, also under Palmer's editorship. Palmer quickly managed to improve Amazing's circulation, and in November 1938, the magazine went monthly again, though this did not last throughout Palmer's tenure: between 1944 and 1946 the magazine was bimonthly and then quarterly {{for a while before}} returning to a longer-lasting monthly schedule.|$|E

He was also {{troubled by the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I for several reasons. He {{was concerned about the}} safety of family and friends in Germany. He needed to find a new printer for the photogravures for Camera Work, which had been printed in Germany for many years. The war caused a significant downturn in the American economy and art became a luxury for many people. By the end of the year, Stieglitz was struggling to keep both 291 and Camera Work alive.

40|$|Nowdays, {{people need}} actual and {{complete}} {{information about their}} surroundings; therefore, {{there are several ways}} to get the information. Newspaper is one way to get information. In reading the newspaper, it is important to get what the newspaper intended to say. Therefore, newspaper should present the information clearly. In order to present the information or event, the reporters or editors cannot put word in any position or with any word but in a systematic pattern. Thus, the writer wants to know the kinds of clause pattern that are frequently used in the headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post. From this study, the writer wants to know the types of clause pattern and the fillers of clause constituent and also the frequency of each type of clause pattern and the fillers of clause constituent, that are mostly used in the headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post. The writer analyses the data by using tagmemic analysis in term of clause pattern. This study takes 50 front pages headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post from 1 April to 30 April 2003, which have single clause. <b>The</b> writer chooses <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> as <b>the</b> data because there are many interesting news at that time to be discussed. The writer analyzes what clause patterns and its constituents are used in the headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post. Then, the writer also analyzes the frequency of type of clause pattern and the filler of clause constituent that are mostly used in the headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post. Through the analysis, she found that the pattern S - P - O was the pattern that was mostly used in the headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post. While, noun mostly filled the filler class of subject; transitive verb mostly filled the filler class of predicate; prepositional phrase of purpose mostly filled the filler class of adverbial, noun phrase mostly filled the filler class of object, prepositional phrase of place and adjective mostly filled the filler class of subjective complement, and noun phrase mostly filled the filler class of objective complement. From the findings, we can see the different linguistic choices, which include the choice of words and expression in term of the slot-class and linguistic structure (the clause pattern) of the headlines of <b>The</b> <b>April?s</b> <b>Issue</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post...|$|R

The protagonist of The Mysterious Clover is a young girl who protects the poor peasants from the cruel and greedy nobles. This work is remarkable for its use of varying angles, including bird's-eye views, and variation {{in the size of}} panels. Sak≈ç Shishido (...) , influenced by American newspaper strips, had used similar techniques in his 1930 , but in a far cruder drawing style than Matsumoto's. The Mysterious Clover had been neglected for decades by manga scholars until it was displayed at a 2006 exhibition at the Yayoi Art Museum, where it caught the eye of Fusanosuke Natsume, who then wrote about it on his blog and in a newspaper column.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>April</b> <b>issue</b> of 2012 of Laboratory News {{contained}} {{an article that}} has caused palaeontologists and other geoscientists to question the scientific integrity of the publication. The article written by Brian J. Ford puts forward the idea that all large dinosaurs were aquatic. Ford‚Äîa microbiologist‚Äîlacked any training in palaeontology, and more importantly had not presented any quantitative {{evidence in support of}} his idea. [...] Nevertheless, the idea has been uncritically embraced by some elements of the popular press, including BBC Four, Daily Mail, Sky News Australia, Times of India, the Daily Telegraph, Top News, Cambridge News, Metro and IB Times. These publications have framed Dr. Ford's hypothesis {{as if it were a}} new idea and a subject of debate among palaeontologists, when the idea of aquatic dinosaurs was considered nearly a century ago, and rejected after careful research forty years ago. [...] Threatened by the critical scrutiny, Ford later wrote a piece in his regular opinion column in the microscopy journal, The Microscope, attempting to defend his hypothesis while comparing himself to Galileo. Again, Ford never provided any evidence in support of his claim and relied largely upon study of the cells of extant species and criticisms of the portrayal of dinosaurs in popular media. When challenged by palaeontologists, Ford did not provide any evidence supporting his claim and relied on the premise of an implied conspiracy by recognised and peer reviewed journals.|$|E
