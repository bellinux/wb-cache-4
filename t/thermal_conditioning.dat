40|$|With the {{development}} of social economy, the electricity difference between on-peak hours and off-peak hours is becoming larger. Air-conditioning system {{is the main reason}} that makes the electricity load imbalanced. As one of the successful strategies of demand side management of electricity, <b>thermal</b> storage air <b>conditioning</b> system {{is becoming more and more}} popular in the world. It is a powerful technology of shifting electricity load from on-peak hours to off-peak hours. Direct evaporation internal-melt <b>thermal</b> storage air <b>conditioning</b> system is one kind of thermal storage systems. It has been developed recently. It is suitable for home or commercial building air conditioning system. The operation of direct evaporation thermal storage system is much related to complicated heat transfer process with solid-liquid phase change. The dynamic characteristics and heat transfer characteristics are important to the design and optimization of the system. Meanwhile, since the thermal storage tank is added to the general air conditioning system, the analysis on the coupling relations among main parts and the heat transfer characteristics of the whole system is necessary. The paper mainly focused on the following aspects, 1) experiments of the ice charging process, discharging process and the heat charging process with the sample system; 2) numerical simulation of direct evaporation <b>thermal</b> storage air <b>conditioning</b> system. First, a series of experiments were carried out during the ice charging process, discharging process and heat charging process with the sample system of direct evaporation of <b>thermal</b> storage air <b>conditioning</b> system. Then the paper analyzed the heat transfer characteristics of the thermal storage tank, developed the mathematical model basing on the heat transfer and energy conservation. The heat transfer coefficient and its dynamic characteristics during the charging and discharging process were numerically analyzed. Basing on the analysis of thermal storage tank and the general air conditioning system, from the perspective of system operation, the mathematical model for the whole direct evaporation <b>thermal</b> storage air <b>conditioning</b> system was founded. With the coupling relations among different main parts, the system’s heat transfer characteristics and dynamic characteristics were studied. 随着社会经济水平的不断发展，电力峰谷差矛盾日益加剧，而空调耗电是造成电网负荷峰谷差的重要因素之一。冰蓄冷空调就是为了实现电网负荷削峰平谷而发展起来的一项实用技术，已经在欧美、日本等发达国家得到广泛而成熟的应用，是当前解决电力峰谷矛盾最成熟的技术之一。为了鼓励冰蓄冷空调的应用，我国各地方政府和电力公司也纷纷出台峰谷差别电价政策，这为冰蓄冷空调技术在我国的大范围推广应用创造了良好的条件。 冰蓄冷技术包含多种技术分支，如应用最早最广泛的冰球式、盘管式等技术，具有系统规模大，集中化等特点。直接蒸发内融式冰蓄冷则是较晚发展起来的一项新技术，它具有系统规模小，适用于小型独立单元式商用或家用空调场合等特点。 直接蒸发式冰蓄冷系统的运行是一种伴有冰水相变潜热的复杂换热过程。各运行工况的动态特性和换热特性是直接蒸发式冰蓄冷系统设计开发和优化的重要依据。同时蓄冰槽与空调系统主要部件连接，研究各部件之间的耦合关系对系统的影响和整个冰蓄冷系统的换热特点具有十分重要的意义。 本论文的研究工作主要集中在两个方面： 1 ）进行直接蒸发冰蓄冷空调蓄冰、融冰和蓄热实验； 2 ）针对直接蒸发冰蓄冷空调的数值模拟； 本文首先利用直接蒸发冰蓄冷系统样机进行了一系列的蓄冰、融冰和蓄热实验，为进一步深入研究提供了大量基础数据。 其次对蓄冰槽的传热过程进行了分析，从传热和能量平衡的角度建立了数学模型，对其蓄、融冰、蓄热机理进行了理论分析。 在对蓄冰槽的传热过程和常规空调系统研究分析的基础上，本文首次建立了直接蒸发式冰蓄冷空调系统的数学模型，考虑到蓄冰槽与空调主要部件之间的耦合关系，详细分析了系统的换热特性和动态特性，为指导直接蒸发冰蓄冷实用技术的产品开发和优化提供了重要的理论基础和参考依据...|$|R

40|$|There are {{extraordinary}} {{opportunities to}} reduce the consumption of fossil energy {{as a result of}} retrofitting the existing buildings in Egypt. For instance, Cairo falls in the arid climate zone with an annual total radiation above 2409 bankable kWh/m 2 per annum with approximately 3300 hours of full sunshine. However, the poorly insulated fabric of most buildings shows relatively high demand for cooling and heating energy. To overcome this problem and to examine these opportunities, this study evaluates the retrofit of a middle-income urban residential case in Cairo. The aim of the study is to investigate the potential and impact of retrofits on two different scales. The first is on the building scale, intending to reach a low-energy performance. The second is on a community scale, intending to increase the dependence on renewable sources. The case study employed TRNSYS to evaluate the performance and energy/carbon emissions savings. The research took in consideration passive and active design strategies such as envelope retrofit, internal loads reduction, and natural ventilation; in addition to domestic water heating, photovoltaic panels and solar <b>thermal</b> air <b>conditioning.</b> The results were evaluated to assess the suitability of each strategy based on energy performance.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymer(FRP) composites {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly used materials due to their adaptability to diverse environmental conditions and the comparative ease of combination with different materials to perform definite purposes and reveal advantageous properties. The components made up of fibre reinforced polymeric composites are exposed to temperature variations (thermal shock, thermal spike, low temperature environment, high temperature environment, freeze thaw), humidity variations, UV radiation and often the combined exposure of these environments leads to more detrimental effect on the performance of the composites during fabrication, in-service time and storage. Further, rate of loading can significantly change the mode of failure. The present experimental investigation deals with the mechanical behavior of FRP composites exposed at low temperature and <b>thermal</b> spiking <b>conditioning</b> with different loading rate and holding time.

40|$|There are {{extraordinary}} {{opportunities to}} reduce the consumption of fossil energy in retrofitting existing buildings in Egypt. For instance, South Tahrir (150 km northwest of Cairo) falls in the arid climate zone with an annual-average daily global irradiation value of 23. 76 MJ/m 2 and for diffuse irradiation they are 9. 65 MJ/m 2 for Cairo and approximately 3300 hours of full sunshine. However, in extreme climates like Egypt, conditions show relatively high demand for cooling and heating energy. To overcome this problem and to examine these opportunities, this study evaluated the active solar retrofit of a passive house built in South Tahrir city.

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> at 39 degreesC on days 13 - 17 of incubation of broiler eggs enabled thermotolerance during post-hatch growth (J. Therm. Biol. 28 (2003) 133). Tolerance to {{a temperature of}} 30 degreesC was accompanied by changes in thyroid hormones and metabolic parameters. In the current study, we determined the mechanism of epigenetic heat adaptation during embryonic age by measuring blood physiological parameters that {{may be associated with}} the ultimate effects of <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Hatching eggs from Ross breeders were subjected to heat treatment of 39 degreesC at days 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of incubation for 2 h per day. Control eggs were incubated at 37. 6 degreesC. Samples of eggs were withdrawn on each day of <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> and at internal pipping (IP) to obtain blood samples from embryos. The remaining eggs were weighed at day 18 and transferred to hatchers. The timing of IP, external pipping (EP) and hatching were monitored every 2 h. At hatch, chicks were weighed and hatchability was determined. Blood samples were obtained from samples of day-old chicks. T 3, T 4, corticosterone, pCO(2), pO(2) levels were determined in the blood. Blood pH was measured and T 3 /T 4 ratios were calculated. Heat conditioning significantly increased corticosterone and pO(2) levels and blood pH but depressed pCO(2) at day 14. These were followed by a significant depression of T 4 level on day 15. Remarkably, at day 16, all these parameters were back to normal as in the control embryos. Hatching was delayed by <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> probably {{as a result of the}} depressed corticosterone levels at IP. Hatchability was also lower in the heat-treated group but 1 -day old chick weights were comparable to those of the controls. The result suggests that epigenetic <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> involves changes in these physiological parameters and probably serve as a method for epigenetic temperature adaptation since the same mechanisms are employed for coping with heat during post-embryonic growth. It also suggests that days 14 - 15 may be the optimal and most sensitive timing for evoking this mechanism during embryonic development. The adverse effects of heat treatment observed in this study may have been due to the continued exposure to heat until day 17. Fine-tuning <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> to days 14 - 15 only may improve these production parameters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine beneficial effects of early age <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> in reducing adverse effects of acute heat stress and decrease losses. Approach: Ninety one day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (n = 30) : (1) control (normally raised), (2) early age <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> (exposed to temperature of 40 ± 1 °C for 24 h at 5 th day of age, then raised as control chicks) and (3) chronic stress (exposed to 33 ± 2 °C from day one till 6 weeks of age). At 42 nd day of age, all chicks were subjected to acute heat stress of 39 ± 2 °C for 2 h. Blood samples were collected from all groups before and after exposure to acute heat stress. Results: Blood pH increased in both controls and thermally-conditioned chicks after exposure to acute heat stress coinciding with significant decrease in blood carbon dioxide pressure (pCo 2) in controls only. Blood potassium level decreased in controls, while in thermally-conditioned or chronically-stressed no significant changes were observed. Blood sodium level showed a trend toward decreased levels in controls while a trend toward increased levels was observed in both thermally-conditioned and chronically-stressed birds. Importantly, significant reductions were observed in total erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level in chronically-stressed birds as compared to other groups before and after acute stress exposure. Hetrophil/lymphocyte ratio increased in both controls and thermally-conditioned chicks after acute heat exposure, but not in chronically-stressed birds. Conclusion: When exposed to acute heat stress at marketing age, chicks subjected to early age <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning</b> responded very similar to birds adapted to chronic heat stress indicating a protective role of early age <b>thermal</b> <b>conditioning...</b>|$|E
