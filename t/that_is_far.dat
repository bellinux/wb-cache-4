25|$|Ovid {{has been}} seen as taking on a persona in his poetry <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> more emotionally {{detached}} from his mistress and less involved in crafting a unique emotional realism within the text than the other elegists. This attitude, coupled with the lack of testimony that identifies Ovid's Corinna with a real person has led scholars to conclude that Corinna was never a real person—and that Ovid's relationship with her is an invention for his elegiac project. Some scholars have even interpreted Corinna as a metapoetic symbol for the elegiac genre itself.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters <b>that</b> <b>are</b> geographically close should use channels with frequencies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism: from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edge of}} G, while those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|R

25|$|Around 1966 AMT {{obtained}} the plastic model rights to Star Trek {{and developed a}} model kit of the Starship Enterprise, beginning a long association between AMT, science fiction and television. The original model of the Enterprise was equipped with battery-operated lights, but even after the lights were deleted, a number of features from the lighted model persisted in the kit, including a removable main deflector assembly which had covered the battery compartment and served as an on-off switch for the lighted model. There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly. There was also a kit of the Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser ship seen on the TV show. It too was lighted in its first couple of issues.|$|E
25|$|The proneural protein Atonal (Ato) is {{responsible}} for the development of Drosophila’s R8 photoreceptors. However, it does not act alone, since it dimerizes with a second identical protein, ‘’Daughterless (Da)’’ that reinforces its expression. The coexpression of ‘’Ato’’ and ‘’Da’’ is important for the migration of the different cell types of an ommatidium and for the repression of atonal in the inter-cluster spaces, functioning as inhibitory signals that regulate both the number and position of the nascent R8 cells. Moreover, this expression leads to the activation of the kinase MAPK that is important for the cellular recruitment and the repressor effect, once, when this kinase is inactive the expression of ‘’Ato’’ is detected in every cell. In an initial state, Hedgehog (‘’Hh’’) and Decapentaplegic are responsible for the activation of ‘’ato’’ in small cellular clusters, leading to the activation of MAPK. First, Hedgehog induces ‘’ato’’ expression in more than just the cells that ultimately become photoreceptor cells, so its expression has to be refined and restricted to a single presumptive R8 cell. Hedgehog signaling is also required to repress ‘’atonal’’ expression between the nascent proneural clusters, which reveals a dual role crucial to building precision and geometry into the adult retina. Therefore, the regulation of ‘’ato’’ expression depends on the levels of Hedgehog: at low levels (<b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> from the source) this pronuclear gene is activated and at high levels (close to the source) it is repressed. Combining lateral inhibition with the dual role played by Hedgehog, one can imagine how the hexagonal array of R8 cells can be patterned.|$|E
