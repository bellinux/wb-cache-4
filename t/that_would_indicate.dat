5|$|On September11, {{the ship}} North American {{reported}} a 'hurricane from SW' at a position <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> a storm centre {{just east of}} Newfoundland. No evidence of a tropical origin for this cyclone has been found.|$|E
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E
25|$|No {{evidence}} has been presented to the inquiry <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> there were any deficiencies in the fitness for duty {{on the part of}} the staff of either Network Rail or First Great Western.|$|E

25|$|At {{least two}} {{pointers}} indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated {{the position of}} the moon, and a mean sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The moon position was not a simple mean moon indicator <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of epicyclic gearing.|$|E
25|$|In response, Deng Xiaoping cited {{clearly the}} lack of room for {{compromise}} {{on the question of}} sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any outcome <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.|$|E
25|$|The cadaver dogs {{searched the}} woods around Vortex Spring without success. Assisted by helicopters, they searched the swamps along the spring's outflow into Blue Creek and Sandy Creek to the Choctawhatchee River. Thirty {{separate}} {{tests of the}} water {{over the next several}} months showed no sign of an increase in the bacteria <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the presence of a decomposing human body. Taran, who said he had let Ben into the cave despite knowing he lacked certification to dive in it, passed a lie detector test of his account.|$|E
50|$|A 2008 {{search for}} a {{tertiary}} companion to this system using an adaptive optics system on the VLT proved unsuccessful. Examination of the system in infrared light at 70 μm shows no excess emission <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>indicate</b> {{the presence of a}} disk of orbiting dust.|$|R
30|$|It is {{possible}} that some RCTs that found increased mortality with the “new intervention” were not published (especially before clinicaltrials.gov registration). If the following supposition were true—there were the same number of RCTs in which both new and old intervention increased mortality—then <b>that</b> supposition <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the vast majority of RCTs were unable to show anything other than equivalence, or non-inferiority.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least one}} company, the Norwich Union, issued [...] "fire marks" [...] printed on calico {{for use in}} rural areas. They were to be fixed on hay ricks, corn stacks and {{shearing}} sheds on the theory <b>that</b> they <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> to arsonists <b>that</b> the owner was insured {{and would not be}} out of pocket should the property be destroyed by fire.|$|R
25|$|Although humans {{migrated}} to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, {{there appear to be}} no traditional Marshallese artifacts present <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> any long-term settlement. The lack of potable water and tiny lot of arable land compared to nearby Utirik has discouraged settlement. The atoll is traditionally occupied for brief periods for seasonal harvesting of copra, fish, turtles, coconut crabs, and other resources. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bikar and Bokak, Toke was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of resources was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.|$|E
25|$|An astrologer {{claimed that}} he was able to {{ascertain}} a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> it. After the astrologer talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that the astrologer thought was theirs. By agreement, the astrologer needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic reactions, {{including}} hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, {{chronic active hepatitis}}, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. The {{onset of}} chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> liver injury. These reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. If signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking nitrofurantoin, the drug should be discontinued. Re-challenge with the drug {{at a later date}} is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly Miss Panney {{determined}} to go to Barport without loss of time; and although she did hot know what sort of summons she should issue to Ralph after she got there, she did {{not in the least}} doubt <b>that</b> circumstances <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the right thing to do. In fact, she would arrange circumstances {{in such a way that}} they should so indicate.|$|R
5000|$|... 1929, {{with the}} start of the Great Depression, {{business}} cycle researchers had a practical emergency on their hands. With the economy back in recession, in the summer of 1937, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. requested Mitchell [...] "to draw up a list of statistical series <b>that</b> <b>would</b> best <b>indicate</b> when the recession would come to an end." ...|$|R
5|$|In September 2012, Hopsin {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> self-produce {{the majority}} of the album, with drummer Travis Barker producing one or two tracks. Later <b>that</b> month, Hopsin <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> interest in working with Childish Gambino. In addition, Hopsin approached Macklemore in January 2013 to get him featured in the album.|$|R
25|$|Town Wall. Established by charter in 1326 by Edward II to the Bailiffs of Carlingford {{it allowed}} them to levy murage for its building. Not much remains however but the little that does has some {{externally}} splayed musket loops <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the arrival of firearms to Ireland in the late 15th century. It {{is likely that the}} wall had an external ditch to strengthen its defences. Its purpose was to serve as a barrier to ensure that goods entering the town had to pass through a town gate (and hence could be taxed) but it also had the purpose of creating a boundary between Gael and Norman.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{excellent}} visibility, {{none of the}} RAF bombers {{had reported}} anything unusual <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> a new weapon or tactics in the German night fighter force. This ignorance was compounded by the tracerless ammunition used by the Bf 110s, as well as firing on the British bombers blind spots. Many RAF crews witnessed a sudden explosion of a friendly aircraft, but assumed, in some cases, it was very accurate flak. Few of the German fighters were seen, let alone fired on. Later on, as the specialist Bf 110G-4s were received by night fighter wings, the mid-cockpit mount was replaced by one at the extreme rear of the cabin.|$|E
25|$|In {{general and}} across cultures, public {{indications}} of sexual arousal are commonly regarded as embarrassing, {{both to the}} person aroused and the onlooker, {{and for this reason}} those parts of the human body <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> arousal are normally covered. Arousal is most evidently indicated by the sex organs and women's breasts, which are routinely covered, even when {{other parts of the body}} may be freely uncovered. Yet the nudity taboo may have meanings deeper than the immediate possibility of sexual arousal, for example, in the cumulative weight of tradition and habit. Clothing also expresses and symbolizes authority, and more general norms and values besides those of a sexual nature.|$|E
60|$|Devine, however, was, as <b>that</b> fact <b>would</b> <b>indicate,</b> {{not the man}} to {{be readily}} turned aside. He wanted mine props, and meant to obtain them, and, though his face grew a trifle grimmer, he climbed the {{hillside}} to where Brooke was busy knee-deep in water at the dam. He signed to him, and then, taking out his cigar-case, {{sat down on a}} log and looked at the younger man.|$|R
50|$|The risk {{of damage}} to a chain of command can be reduced by {{removing}} or concealing features <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>indicate</b> an officer's rank. Modern armies tend to avoid saluting officers in the field, and eliminate rank insignia on battle dress uniforms (BDU). Officers can seek maximum cover before revealing themselves as good candidates for elimination through actions such as reading maps or using radios.|$|R
50|$|Although {{fish are}} {{relatively}} well studied within the park, that is, 37 percent of {{species have been}} discovered once, the numbers and research undertaken {{suggests that there is}} potentially a relatively large number of undescribed or undiscovered fish species that are endemic to the park. With such potential for discovery of new species, <b>that</b> alone <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> it remains a significant area for increased biodiversity amongst the marine life and warrants conservation.|$|R
25|$|As these {{cultures}} {{interacted with}} each other {{over a period of}} nearly 2000 years, there is little evidence of open warfare, although there is speculation that the huge Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements grew as large as they did during their later phase of their culture as a result of providing a stronger defense against any potential raiding conducted by nomadic Proto-Indo-European groups that might have been wandering through their neighborhood. Still, remarkably, almost no actual weapons have been found in any Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, neither have there been skeletal remains discovered <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the person had died violently (arrowheads lodged in the bones, crushed skulls, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Although humans {{migrated}} to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago, {{there appear to be}} no traditional Marshallese artifacts present <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> any long term settlement. The harsh, desiccated climate, lack of potable water, and poverty of the soils indicate that the atoll will probably remain uninhabited. The atoll has traditionally been used for hunting and gathering, particularly seabirds, by inhabitants of other atolls in the northern Ratak chain. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bikar and Toke, Bokak was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of abundant sea turtles, birds, and eggs was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.|$|E
25|$|Varricchio et al. (2008) {{examined}} the bone histology of Two Medicine troodont specimen MOR 748 {{and found that}} it lacked the bone resorption patterns <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> it was an egg-laying female. They also measured the ratio of the total volume of eggs in clutches to the body mass of the adult. They graphed correlations between this ratio and the type of parenting strategies used by extant birds and crocodiles and found that the ratio in the troodont was consistent with that in birds where only the adult male broods the eggs. From this they concluded that troodont females likely did not brood eggs, that the males did, and this may be a character shared between maniraptoran dinosaurs and basal birds.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1794 with the marking {{out of the}} route. The {{practice}} was {{to set up a}} line of pegs or stakes about 50 yd apart so <b>that</b> their tops <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the intended water level. It would then be possible to construct the appropriate embankments and cuttings.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1986 film Down and Out in Beverly Hills a Cal Worthington {{commercial}} {{plays in}} {{a scene in which}} a character cannot get to sleep. The implication is that Worthington's overnight ads were so well known <b>that</b> seeing them <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> to the audience that the character was awake well after midnight.|$|R
5000|$|Fujimura confessed {{and apologized}} {{the same day}} in a press conference. He {{said that he had}} been [...] "possessed by an {{uncontrollable}} urge". He had planted the artifacts from his own collection in strata <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have <b>indicated</b> earlier dates. In Kamitakamori he had planted 61 of 65 artifacts, and had earlier planted all of the stonework in the Soshin Fudozaka site in Hokkaidō. He claimed that these were the only times he had planted artifacts.|$|R
25|$|The popular idea {{seems to}} be that the Title is among the ranking factors and the {{description}} is more of an advertising for the searcher looking at the search results. In other words, while the Title tag is one of the factors determining if a page will rank for a certain keyword, the meta description will only help a search result stand out (or not, depending upon how well-written it is). If more people click on a result with a good description, it may reasonably be expected that Google will reward that same result with a higher ranking. This, of course, if visitors to the link do not immediately leave the page after visiting - <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> misleading or poor content. This, in fact, would be likely to demote the result on SERP (Search Engine Results Page).|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard measure <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> {{changes in the}} value of the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obta{{in the value of}} total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E
25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
5000|$|Daniels {{was able}} to {{complete}} {{what must have been}} some temporary repairs for $600 because by September 1876 the West Union Covered Bridge was completed.

50|$|Some homeowners {{resort to}} more {{interesting}} {{ways of dealing}} with this problem, such as collecting and placing fur from pets such as domestic cats and dogs in attics. It is hoped <b>that</b> this fur <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> to nesting squirrels that a potential predator roams, and will encourage evacuation. Odoriferous repellents, including mothballs and ammonia, are generally ineffective in expelling squirrels from buildings.|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{these results}} may be driven {{by the fact that}} fathers’ {{socio-economic}} background is relatively less important for them than for natives and their earnings is determined mainly by their own endowments. Therefore, with high intergenerational mobility, we expect the offspring of poor immigrants to be able to encompass their background and to perform better. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> certainly <b>indicate</b> the immigrants and ethnic minorities are able to improve their position over time, which might be a reflection of more equitable labour market in the host country.|$|R
