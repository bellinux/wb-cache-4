Backings come primarily in two types: cutaway and <b>tear-away.</b> With cutaway, the excess backing is cut with a pair of scissors.

For example, knits and large designs typically require firm stabilization. There are many methods for stabilizing fabric, but most often one or more additional pieces of material called stabilizers or interfacing are added beneath or on top of the fabric, or both. Stabilizer types include cut-away, <b>tear-away,</b> solvy water-soluble, heat-n-gone, filmoplast, and open mesh, sometimes in various combinations.|$|E
25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized <b>tear-away</b> envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams of where to go next.|$|E

There may be legal issues around wild posting, however, if the display is not posted on a paid advertising space as it is illegal to advertise on private property without prior consent.|$|E

Elfman was {{apprehensive}} at first, because of his lack of formal training, but with orchestration assistance from Oingo Boingo guitarist and arranger Steve Bartek, he achieved his goal of emulating the mood of such composers as Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann. [...] In the booklet for {{the first volume of}} Music for a Darkened Theatre, Elfman described the first time he heard his music played by a full orchestra {{as one of the most}} thrilling experiences of his life. Elfman immediately developed a rapport with Burton and has gone on to score all but three of Burton's major studio releases: Ed Wood, which was under production while Elfman and Burton were having a serious disagreement, Sweeney Todd, and most recently Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Elfman also provided the singing voice for Jack Skellington in Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and the voices of both Barrel and the [...] "Clown with the <b>Tear-Away</b> Face". In 1990, Elfman composed the iconic orchestra piece, 'Ice Dance', for the Tim Burton film Edward Scissorhands.

40|$|The cephalic vein is {{recommended}} as the access route for an {{implantable cardioverter defibrillator}} lead to avoid complications associated with subclavian vein puncture; however, cephalic vein cutdown is not necessarily preferred, mainly because of procedural complexity. To facilitate cephalic vein cutdown, we have devised the following method. An 8 Fr catheter {{is placed in the}} cephalic vein over a guidewire inserted percutaneously from the left peripheral cephalic vein. The catheter, which is palpable beneath the skin prior to incision, indicates the location of the cephalic vein, facilitating its isolation. A specially designed 9 Fr <b>tear-away</b> sheath-dilator unit is used to place leads. With its long-tapered and curved tip, the unit is easy to insert, even when the cephalic vein is stenotic or tortuous. The 30 -cm-long sheath reaches the right atrium, and thus the lead is advanced directly to the right atrium without risk of vascular injury. This technique may be feasible in the majority of patients and can even be used by inexperienced implanters...|$|E
