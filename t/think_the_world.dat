500|$|Ferdinando {{rejected}} it outright with the fullest support of Louis XIV, his great-uncle. Cosimo's eyes now fell upon Violente of Bavaria. Choosing her would strengthen ties between France—where Violente's sister was the dauphine—and Bavaria. There {{was only one}} obstacle in the way, Ferdinando II, Cosimo's father, impartially advised Violente's father, Ferdinand Maria, to invest a huge sum into a bank. Soon after the Elector deposited the sum, the bank collapsed. Ferdinand Maria still had sore feelings; Cosimo consented to the reduction of her dowry accordingly to reimburse the Elector. Ferdinando was unimpressed with his wife. Violente, however, electrified the Grand Duke. He wrote, [...] "I have never known, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> can produce, a disposition so perfect..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} acquire Violante Beatrice's {{hand for the}} Grand Prince, Cosimo was obliged to reimburse Ferdinand Maria's son Maximilian II. With this {{obstacle}} surmounted, the marriage contract was signed on 24 May 1688, granting Violante Beatrice a dowry of 400,000 thalers in cash and the same amount in jewellery. She married the Grand Prince by proxy in Munich on 21 November 1688 and was married in person on 9 January 1689. The wedding reception {{was held at the}} Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence. The new Grand Princess was instantly enamoured with the bridegroom, {{in spite of the fact}} he loathed her. Cosimo III, however, could not find fault in his daughter-in-law, saying, [...] "I have never known, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> can produce, a disposition so perfect".|$|E

500|$|Many {{felt the}} tone of the album was millennial or futuristic, anticipating {{cultural}} and political trends. According to The A.V. Club writer Steven Hyden in the feature [...] "Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation", [...] "Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that's subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century." [...] In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a [...] "prescient... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology... oozing [...] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11." [...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would {{be interesting to see how}} the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?" ...|$|E

The vocals were produced by Curtis [...] "Sauce" [...] Wilson, with Gregg Rominiecki engineering Big Sean's vocals. Serban Ghenea handled the mixing of the track, which was engineered by John Hanes, and finally the mix was mastered by Aya Merrill and Tom Coyne. It is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It is about a couple trying to [...] "make up their minds {{about the future of}} their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] Grande revealed that [...] "Best Mistake" [...] was her favorite track on My Everything: [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of [...] and I'm obsessed with his writing on this song in particular.

"Bossy" [...] {{was written}} by Shaffer Smith, known by his stage name Ne-Yo, while {{additional}} writing and song production was done by Stargate members Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. In the beginning of May 2008, a clip of the song leaked on YouTube. As a result, Universal Motown released the full song to media outlets on May 7, 2008. In an interview with Billboard, Ne-Yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for Lohan: [...] "I gotta admit, we were like ... Lindsay Lohan?' I mean, I've written for Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan? But I will say this; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job. I was so shocked I had to call her and apologize for what I was thinking because she did so good. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is gonna be surprised." [...] In an interview with People Magazine, he revealed the song [...] "it's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it. In this case, 'Bossy' is a term that describes confidence and power." [...] "Bossy" [...] was digitally released on May 27, 2008, and it was set to appear on Lohan's third studio album.|$|E

500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>world</b> is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
500|$|Coe's {{interpretation}} {{was repeated}} by other scholars {{through the early}} 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. [...] "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," [...] said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. [...] "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention." [...] In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya [...] "did not conceive this {{to be the end of}} creation, as many have suggested." [...] Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, [...] "We have no record or knowledge that [...] would <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> would come to an end" [...] in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, [...] "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," [...] and, [...] "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in." [...] "There will be another cycle," [...] said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. [...] "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." [...] Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said [...] "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset." ...|$|E

Johnson said, “What sticks in my mind is that sense of sacrilege {{and a feeling of}} horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives.
