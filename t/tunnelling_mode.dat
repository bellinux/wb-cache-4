A model Hamiltonian is {{used with a}} 1 -dimensional <b>tunnelling</b> <b>mode</b> coupled to an (M− 1) -dimensional harmonic bath, a system-bath problem. The benchmark calculation uses a basis set expansion of the wavefunction, with separate basis functions for the system and bath. Indistinguishability of configurations is exploited to greatly reduce {{the expense of the}} calculation, and a fully converged result is achieved. Comparison is offered to existing quantum dynamical methods that have tested this model problem, and further benchmark results not previously studied are presented...|$|E
40|$|The depolarized {{scattering}} profile between 3 and 300 cm- 1 {{has been}} studied for aqueous solutions of perchloric acid and nitric acid, and their sodium salts. The profile has been analysed in terms of four component bands, {{two of which are}} at zero energy shift, one is at c. 60 cm- 1 and one at c. 180 cm- 1. In addition, solutions containing the nitrate ion show evidence for two extra bands which have been assigned to a <b>tunnelling</b> <b>mode</b> of the NO 3 - ion (c. 10 cm- 1) and a cooperative librational mode (c. 120 cm- 1). Changes in halfwidth have been interpreted in terms of a decrease in motional damping due to the presence of foreign species. The intensity of all components shows a considerable change with concentration; this is dependent on ion polarizability. Interpretation of the results in terms of cooperative phenomena in the condensed phase is also discussed...|$|E

The paper presents a case history involving tunnelling in difficult mixed geological conditions belowan existing Metro Line (Line 4). Tunnelling was performed with a dual EPB boring machine and the closed mode of operation was prescribed beneath all sensitive structures. Despite this original prescription, an open mode excavation (with a partially filled pressure chamber) had to be adopted to avoid the interruption of the boring process in the area below the existing Metro Line 4. The paper describes the geological conditions of the site, presents some of the ground movement observations prior to the change of excavation mode and discusses the rationale that allowed {{the change in the}} prescribed <b>tunnelling</b> <b>mode</b> as well as the results obtained.

40|$|Abstract: Quantum {{tunnelling}} is {{a phenomenon}} which becomes relevant at the nanoscale and below. It is a paradox from the classical point of view as it enables elementary particles and atoms to permeate an energetic barrier {{without the need for}} sufficient energy to over-come it. Tunnelling might seem to be an exotic process only important for special physical effects and applications such as the Tunnel Diode, Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (electron tunnelling) or Near-field Optical Microscopy operating in photon <b>tunnelling</b> <b>mode.</b> However, this review demonstrates that tunnelling can do far more, being of vital importance for life: physical and chemical processes which are crucial in theories about the origin and evolution of life can be traced directly back to the effects of quantum tunnelling. These processes include the chemical evolution in stellar interiors and within the cold interstellar medium, prebiotic chemistry in the atmos-phere and subsurface of planetary bodies, planetary habitability via insolation and geothermal heat as well as the function of biomolecular nanomachines. This review shows that quantum tunnelling has many highly important implications to the field of molecular and biologi-cal evolution, prebiotic chemistry and astrobiology...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 233 - 238. Two {{back-to-back}} Morse potentials {{are used}} to model the protonic potential in a hydrogen bond. A mathematical method is developed to obtain semi-classical solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the potential. Particular care is taken over the form of approximation used {{in the vicinity of}} the barrier top. The double Morse potential is then used as the fundamental element in the analysis of the proton dynamics in a number of hydrogen-bonded species: a) Chromous acid. A consistent, quantitative explanation is found for the νs(OH) /vs(OD) bands in the mid-infrared spectra of CrOOH/CrOOD. The 226 cm⁻¹ band in the far infrared and neutron scattering spectra of CrOOH is shown to be caused by the protonic <b>tunnelling</b> <b>mode.</b> b) Carboxylic and Dicarboxylic acids. The 140 cm⁻¹ protonic upper state splitting in dimeric formic acid proposed by Excoffon and Marechal (1972) is shown to be supported by the double Morse potential analysis. The analysis suggest's however that the two hydrogen-bonded protons in (HCOOH) ₂ tunnel independently. The anomalous vs(OH) /vs(OD) intensity ratios observed in the infrared spectra of both adipic acid and dimeric formic acid could not be explained in terms of mechanical anharmonicity alone. The protonic tunnelling frequency in crystalline formic acid is shown to be about 23 cm⁻¹, which supports the order-disorder interpretation of the observed phase transition in this crystal. c) Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KDP). The crystallographic and infrared spectroscopic data for KDP and DKDP are interpreted consistently using the double Norse potential. The bare single-particle tunnelling frequency Ω is estimated to be 320 ± 10 cm⁻¹ and the overtone band at 4600 cm⁻¹ in the infrared spectrum of KDP is shown to be a : 0 →: 3 > single particle transition. The model is capable of predicting the temperature and pressure dependence of both the protonic tunnelling frequency and the protonic inter-site separation δ. The soft-mode Raman data of Peercy (1975) is re-analysed allowing for the temperature dependence of Ω...|$|E

Two tunneling modes are resolved at 23. 7 and 7. 0 microeV at 4. 5 K. Their intensities {{are consistent with the}} presence of two further unresolved tunneling modes. Quasielastic spectra are composed of three Lorentzians of equal intensities. The two low activation energies and <b>tunnel</b> <b>modes</b> are modeled into consistent rotational potentials. The third activation energy and a librational band are used to guess the strength of the two stronger rotational potentials.

This way the <b>tunnel</b> <b>modes</b> couple to ring torsions whose energy determines the broadening of both tunnel bands. The calculations for free molecules yield mode frequencies a little bit lower than the experimental inelastic neutron scattering (INS) values.
