5|$|The insurgents were poorly armed, and {{eventually}} were {{overwhelmed by the}} tsarist regular military. Most of <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> fell by 24 June; the last of <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> (in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops {{by the end of}} 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest—including occasional shots at police or military patrols—would continue for days afterwards.|$|E

5000|$|When Marius {{arrives at}} <b>the</b> <b>barricade,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "revolution" [...] has already started. When he stoops {{down to pick}} up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally {{wounding}} the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of <b>the</b> <b>barricade,</b> holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up <b>the</b> <b>barricade.</b> After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from <b>the</b> <b>barricade.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>barricade</b> is an {{emergency}} recovery system used only when a normal (pendant) arrestment cannot be made. <b>The</b> <b>barricade</b> is normally in a stowed condition and rigged only when required. To rig a barricade, it is stretched across the flight deck between stanchions, which are raised from the flight deck. Rigging <b>the</b> <b>barricade</b> is routinely practiced by U.S. carrier flight deck personnel; a well trained crew can accomplish the task in under three minutes.|$|R

5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a no-go area, defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned <b>the</b> <b>barricades,</b> and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E
5|$|The first air {{transport}} {{mission to the}} Kokoda front was flown on 26 July, when a DC-3 from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron landed 15 troops of the 39th Infantry Battalion and some stores. A C-53 followed that afternoon with another 15 men and some stores. The flight time to Kokoda was about 20 minutes. An air supply run the following day by a C-53 and a DC-2 found the airstrip barricaded. <b>The</b> <b>barricades</b> were removed, but the aircraft were recalled by a radio message that the Kokoda Drome could not be held. The loss of the airstrip meant a switch to air dropping supplies. An aircraft was sent that afternoon, but was recalled. On 28 July, a DC-5, a DC-3 and a DC-2 dropped supplies near Kokoda. Three transports dropped supplies near Kagi on 29 July, and one on 30 July. No more missions were flown until 6 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon {{destroyed}} <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> {{at the front of}} the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E

5000|$|The police, who had {{suffered}} a barrage of missiles, then moved in. Whilst the police fought with the rioters at William Street, officers at <b>the</b> Rossville Street <b>barricade</b> encouraged civilian Protestants slingshotting stones across <b>the</b> <b>barricade</b> at <b>the</b> Catholics. [...] The police then tried to alleviate the pressure they were under by dismantling <b>the</b> <b>barricade.</b> <b>The</b> result of this {{was the creation of}} a gap allowing Protestant civilians through, convincing the Catholic residents that their homes were going to be attacked.|$|R
5|$|For a {{brief period}} in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the climate of {{political}} change and upheaval that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havlíček was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy. A Citizens' Army ("Svornost") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two marches dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, and The Song of Freedom to words by Ján Kollár. In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by the Prince of Windisch-Grätz. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> on the Charles Bridge. The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havlíček. During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, Karel Sabina, who would later provide libretti for Smetana's first two operas.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Fronde insurrection {{broke out}} in Paris, {{prompted}} by high taxes, increased food prices and disease. The Parlement of Paris, the Regency government of Anne of Austria and rebellious noble factions fought for several years {{to take control of}} the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as another Day of <b>the</b> <b>Barricades.</b> The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the Hôtel de Ville, controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot. Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille. On 11 January 1649, the Fronde decided to take the Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders. Elbeuf's attack required only a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January. Pierre Broussel, one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the governor and the Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.|$|E
5|$|Once the Elector and his co-commander, Marshal Marsin, {{knew of the}} Allies' objective, they {{dispatched}} Count d'Arco with {{an advance}} force of 12,000 men from their main camp at Dillingen to strengthen and hold the Schellenberg heights above the town. Rejecting a protracted siege, Marlborough decided in favour of a quick assault, before the position could be made impregnable. After two failed attempts to storm <b>the</b> <b>barricades,</b> the Allied commanders, acting in unison, finally managed to overwhelm the defenders. It had taken just two hours to secure the bridgehead over the river in a hard fought contest, but following the victory, momentum was lost to indecision. The deliberate devastation of the Elector's lands in Bavaria failed to bring Max Emanuel to battle or persuade {{him back into the}} Imperial fold. Only when Marshal Tallard arrived with reinforcements to strengthen the Elector's forces, and Prince Eugene of Savoy arrived from the Rhine to bolster the Allies, was the stage finally set for the decisive action at the Battle of Blenheim the following month.|$|E

5|$|The Bastille was {{involved}} in the numerous wars of religion fought between Protestant and Catholic factions with support from foreign allies {{during the second half of}} the 16th century. Religious and political tensions in Paris initially exploded in the Day of <b>the</b> <b>Barricades</b> on 12 May 1588, when hard-line Catholics rose up in revolt against the relatively moderate Henry III. After a day's fighting had occurred across the capital, Henry III fled and the Bastille surrendered to Henry, the Duke of Guise and leader of the Catholic League, who appointed Bussy-Leclerc as his new captain. Henry III responded by having the Duke and his brother murdered later that year, whereupon Bussy-Leclerc used the Bastille as a base to mount a raid on the Parlement de Paris, arresting the president and other magistrates, whom he suspected of having royalist sympathies, and detaining them in the Bastille. They were not released until the intervention of Charles, the Duke of Mayenne, and the payment of substantial ransoms. Bussy-Leclerc remained in control of the Bastille until December 1592, when, following further political instability, he was forced to surrender the castle to Charles and flee the city.|$|E
25|$|At about 1:30 am, {{the police}} attacked. A wave of about 150 {{of them in}} riot gear charged {{the western part of}} <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> in a solid shield wall. Due to an early warning from the lookout post on top of the squat, the {{defenders}} were prepared. They bombarded the police with stones and petrol bombs, forcing them to retreat after about 10 minutes. Of the 150 police officers involved in the charge, only about 14 made it near <b>the</b> <b>barricades,</b> and about 40 police officers were injured in the attack.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the squatters, demonstrators expanded <b>the</b> <b>barricades.</b> They stole trailers and building materials from a nearby construction site to build more barricades. Soon the obstacles covered several streets, in places four or five layers deep. Cobblestones from the streets were broken up and distributed for use as missiles. Soon, the whole street had been turned into something like a fortress. After an hour, the police attacked with 50 men. They were quickly turned back by a hail of stones and iron pellets fired from slingshots. Several police officers were injured. The police then retreated, and both sides regrouped. Around 600 people, primarily youths, had chosen to remain behind <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> and help the squatters defend the house.|$|E
25|$|By this time, {{hundreds}} of people had amassed at <b>the</b> <b>barricades</b> along Mendiola, only a hundred meters away from Malacañang.
