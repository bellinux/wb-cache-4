5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
5|$|Online {{multiplayer}} {{is set up}} {{similarly to}} local multiplayer but allows <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> be at separate computers. Additionally, hotseat can be combined with online play, so multiple human players can use each computer.|$|E
5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
50|$|Allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> {{place his}} house in <b>the</b> <b>player</b> order one space back in every round, {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> bid resources earlier.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategy}} game requires <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> deploy {{up to five}} {{agents to}} different nations with one of two objectives; infiltrate or organize a local resistance. The former allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> discover critical items to complete the game. The latter allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> delay <b>the</b> invasion of the USA.|$|R
50|$|In casino {{play the}} first betting round begins with <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{left of the}} big blind, and {{subsequent}} rounds begin with <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dealer's left. Home games typically use an ante; the first betting round begins with <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dealer's left, and the second round begins with <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who opened <b>the</b> first round.|$|R
5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's province while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E
5000|$|The game's most {{distinguishing}} features are the jetpacks and [...] "skis" [...] offered on all variants {{of the power}} armor. Jetpacks allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> fly for short periods of time, using <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> energy meter. This energy regenerates whenever the jetpack is not active. Skiing may be activated any time <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is on foot and does not cost energy; this switches <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> a frictionless ground-travel mode, allowing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> slide very rapidly down slopes and (with sufficient speed before activating the skis) across flat terrain. Skiing up a slope will cause <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> slow due to gravity.|$|R
50|$|Opens {{the item}} menu, {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> see what items are on board, what items are available, and allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> view any collected clues.|$|R
50|$|The game allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> pick up items, go to {{different}} locations, listen to characters, and find trivial click points. Clicking on an item allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> drag {{it over the}} screen. Clicking on a certain place while holding an object allows Ollo to use it. Most puzzles require <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> make exchanges with characters and trade items.|$|R
5|$|In 1902, Macartney joined North Sydney Cricket Club in {{the first}} {{division}} of Sydney Grade Cricket and then moved to the Gordon club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed during the 1905–06 season. He played regularly for Gordon until 1933–34 when he was 47, amassing 7648 runs {{at an average of}} 54.62. He was known for his dominant status at the Chatswood Oval. In one match, he lofted a ball out of the ground, over a railway line and onto an adjacent lawn bowling green, forcing <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> take evasive action.|$|E
5|$|Team Bath Football Club was an English {{association}} {{football club}} {{affiliated with the}} University of Bath {{in the city of}} Bath, Somerset, in 1999. The club was formed to allow <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> combine professional football with higher education. Team Bath rose rapidly through the English football league system, reaching the Conference South in its ninth season, but disbanded after one season at that level following a decision by the Football Conference and The Football League that its financial structure disqualified it from further promotion.|$|E
5|$|The Hitmen {{are active}} within the community, {{supporting}} numerous programs and charities. They host an annual teddy bear toss each December. The 13th annual Petro Canada Teddy Bear Toss, held on , 2007, saw what the Hitmen {{claim to be}} a world record 26,919 bears tossed on to the ice by 17,341 fans. The bears are donated to charities throughout the Calgary area. A few of the bears are personally delivered by <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> the Alberta Children's Hospital, an event highly anticipated by patients attending the hospital.|$|E
50|$|Royal Canadian Artillery: this heavy-artillery based {{regiment}} allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> use creeping barrage, counter-battery fire, overwatch, {{and allows}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> deploy Priest Self Propelled Gun and supercharge artillery shots.|$|R
50|$|Amped 3 {{features}} several {{ski resorts}} {{with a variety}} of challenges in addition to the main story. Completing these challenges earns <b>the</b> <b>player</b> respect points and money. In addition, certain challenges unlock new clothing, gear, tricks, and music. These challenges include media call-outs that require <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> perform a certain type of trick, timed runs, sled and snowmobile challenges, races that require <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> collect a certain number of objects within a set time, and challenges that require <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> beat a professional snowboarder. Gaining respect points allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> unlock new areas of the mountain and advance the main story.|$|R
50|$|All the {{original}} transformations in Super Mario Galaxy return except for Ice Mario and Flying Mario, {{along with some}} new power-ups and items. These include the Spin Drill, which allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> burrow through some planets and emerge out the other side; Rock Mario, which allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> smash through obstacles, such as boulders and enemies; and Cloud Mario, which allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> create temporary platforms in midair.|$|R
5|$|The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii {{versions}} of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock feature online competitive play, {{in which the}} player can compete against another user through the console's network service. There are three modes of online play, Face Off, Pro Face Off, and Battle mode. Face Off challenges are score attack modes introduced in Guitar Hero II where two players attempt to gain the best score on a given song; in the standard Face Off challenge, the players may select different difficulty levels, while Pro Face Off requires <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> play at the same difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built {{right into the}} stand itself (as shown on old {{photographs}} of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses {{on the road and}} rented them to players. One of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.|$|E
5|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. The damp {{conditions}} meant that sawdust had to be added in large amounts to allow <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> keep their grip. The humid conditions, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers, with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the extras}} {{collected}} {{are a new}} gearbox (allowing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> switch to low gear for higher acceleration), water-skis or a snorkel (<b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> cross water) and a larger fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|Portals lead <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> many {{different}} places, and provide functions for <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> explore. Portals contain several {{different types of}} gameplay, and players can gain different types of rewards depending on their performance.|$|R
5000|$|Nimble: Allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> double-jump, glide, {{and perform}} jumping kicks. The double jump ability allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> access some extra items, but the glide ability {{seems to have}} only one {{function}} in the game.|$|R
5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1906–07 season, {{the players}} were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the {{principles}} of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. The players could work for the government, and the work allowed <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> play for the team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status {{of each and every}} player had to be publicized.|$|E
5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat got up from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E
5000|$|Sega also {{released}} a Master System port in [...] This 8-bit version made {{changes to the}} game by introducing a power-up system that allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> enter secret shops and upgrade parts of their armor. This includes helmets, which give <b>the</b> <b>player</b> access <b>to</b> new weapons and magic spells; chest armor, which allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> sustain more damage; and boots, which increases <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> speed.|$|R
50|$|Backyard Basketball {{offers two}} primary modes of gameplay: Single Game, which allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> select {{a team to}} compete against a {{computer-controlled}} team, and Season Play, which allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> select a team to compete against a series of computer-controlled teams over an 18-game season, including two best-of-three playoff series and a best-of-five championship series should <b>the</b> <b>player</b> achieve {{a large number of}} victories. The Single Game mode also allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> compete against a second <b>player</b> or <b>to</b> practice using a single character.|$|R
50|$|The game uses a battery-backed save system, {{which allows}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> save their {{progress}} at any time. However, it only allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> save {{a maximum of}} 15 times, with four different save slots to use.|$|R
5|$|With captain Johnson {{and vice}} captain Miller, the main spinner {{and one of}} the two leading fast bowlers {{retiring}} upon their return from the subcontinent, Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> stake their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.|$|E
5|$|As {{the merger}} of the AFL and NFL became {{effective}} in 1970, the unions agreed to meet {{for the first time}} in January of that year. The NFL players wanted Ed Meador—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp. The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for union certification.|$|E
5|$|Hill's Test career {{ended in}} {{controversy}} amid another {{dispute with the}} Board of Control. He was once again appointed captain of the Australian team against an English side captained by Johnny Douglas in 1911–12. The English team included bowlers of the calibre of Barnes and Frank Foster and, after losing the first Test in Sydney, won all four remaining Tests to secure the Ashes. Hill had a lean season with the bat, managing 274runs {{at an average of}} 27.40. The England bowlers were clearly superior to the Australian batsmen; Trumper was the only Australian to score a century during the Tests. While this series took place, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted right of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>to</b> appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, a group of senior players, including Hill, threatened to withdraw from the next tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, Frank Laver, was appointed.|$|E
50|$|Skills, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} abilities, are special techniques that <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can use in battle {{to help them}} towards their goals. Each skill has its own unique statistics, some being as simple as allowing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> throw grenades, while others will allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> become invisible {{for a period of}} time. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> can have up to three abilities equipped at one time. Abilities allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> customize <b>the</b> way {{that they would like to}} play in battle. Some abilities are more geared for defensive play, while others are for offensive.|$|R
50|$|F.E.A.R. 2 {{does not}} allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> {{manually}} save and features a single save slot that relies on a checkpoint system. However, the game allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> replay any level {{from the main menu}} after first completing that level.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese Family Computer version, Gun Sight, {{includes}} a password feature that allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> begin at later missions. In contrast, the American NES version {{increased the number}} of continues from three to five and allows <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> adjust <b>the</b> starting number of lives from the default three to five. The Japanese version did not include support for the LaserScope, only allowing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> standard controller or the Famicom's light gun.|$|R
