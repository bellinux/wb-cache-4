5|$|As {{part of the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Federal Railroad Administration {{identified}} ten regions {{for potential}} development as high-speed rail corridorsErie lies in a gap near three corridors: the Chicago Hub Network, the Empire Corridor, and the Keystone Corridor. The local passenger rail advocacy group, All Aboard Erie, proposed a feasibility study in 2014 for high-speed rail service to connect to <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> at Cleveland and Buffalo. The group also sought to determine if rail service would be possible using the existing tracks and right of way between Erie, Youngstown and Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. The player has to manually navigate through <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> of Fargo to explore the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|When a {{decision}} was made to build a second hotel next to the Waldorf, truce provisions were developed between the Astors which reserved some proprietary rights. The plan design used corridors to join the two buildings and there was even a bond provision for bricking up <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> should the need arise. On November 1, 1897, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The Astoria, named after Astoria, Oregon which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811, stood on the site of William B. Astor’s house, and was leased to Boldt.|$|E
50|$|The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport was {{constructed}} near Fort Snelling in 1921. When {{it became a}} major transit hub <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> was extended to the airport. In the 1989 a county transit plan for Ramsey County was made. <b>The</b> <b>corridor</b> between <b>the</b> airport and Downtown Saint Paul was considered an important <b>corridor.</b> When <b>the</b> Mall of America {{was constructed}} <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> was extended to the mall. The route was first named <b>the</b> Riverview <b>Corridor</b> in February 1997 after the Ramsey County board unanimously voted <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> as a higher priority than <b>the</b> Central <b>Corridor.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>corridor</b> {{contains}} original, Art Deco-style, interior finishes. Each end of <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> {{floor is}} inset with a brass-and-terrazzo panel with an envelope motif. Pairs of engaged black marble columns with aluminum ribs and stylized Doric order capitals flank two murals {{at each end}} of <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> <b>The</b> murals, painted in 1934 by the Barker Painting Company of New York, depict the eastern and western hemispheres.

5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through <b>the</b> <b>corridors,</b> and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|Following Kid, {{the group}} infiltrates Viper Manor {{on the night}} of a full moon. While sneaking through <b>the</b> <b>corridors,</b> they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while {{unraveling}} the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core. The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality. Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Maputo <b>Corridor</b> is <b>the</b> most {{significant}} development project {{undertaken by the}} South African government since 1994. <b>The</b> <b>Corridor</b> is an extremely complex project, bringing together a variety of actors from South Africa, Mozambique, and beyond. The project includes the rehabilitation and upgrading of major transport and communications infrastructure between Witbank and Maputo, institutional reform to expedite border-crossing, and incentives for labour-intensive investment in the areas adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>Corridor.</b> <b>The</b> Maputo <b>Corridor</b> is also <b>the</b> first build-operate- transfer highway in the region. <b>The</b> Maputo <b>Corridor</b> is a valid and fascinating subject for political inquiry because it provides insight into the new South African government's priorities and ideological stance. Research on <b>the</b> <b>Corridor</b> also contributes {{to our understanding of}} political power structures in the region. The primary goal of this dissertation was to come to an understanding of why and how <b>the</b> Maputo <b>Corridor</b> developed. Research was designed to test popular hypotheses from the South African media. These hypotheses were (1) that <b>the</b> <b>Corridor</b> was designed to isolate Gauteng from potential transport-based blackmail by the IFP and (2) that <b>the</b> <b>Corridor</b> was sponsored and directed by the leaders of Mpumalanga Province. This dissertation is composed of four main sections. First, the historical context of <b>the</b> <b>Corridor</b> starting in <b>the</b> 19 th century is investigated. Repetitive historical themes with relevance for the present are identified. Second, the leaders and managers of <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> project are pinpointed. Third, strategic motivations for <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> in <b>the</b> current political environment are studied. The fourth part consists of an investigation of the means used to implement <b>the</b> <b>Corridor.</b> Several sources of information were used. These sources included indepth interviews with <b>the</b> <b>Corridor's</b> stakeholders, primary documentation, and secondary published sources...|$|R
5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
5|$|Major General Ariel Sharon's 143rd Armored Division {{was given}} the {{critical}} tasks of opening <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> and laying the bridges. His division included Tuvia Raviv's 600th Armored Brigade, Colonel Amnon Reshef's 14th Armored Brigade, and the 'Haim' Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Erez. Major General Abraham Adan's 162nd Armored Division was tasked with crossing the canal and achieving an encirclement with its 300 tanks. The division included Colonel Natke Nir's 217th Armored Brigade, Colonel Gabi Amir's 460th Armored Brigade and Aryeh Keren's 500th Armored Brigade. A paratrooper brigade would be transferred to Adan's division {{during the course of}} the battle. Kalman Magen's 252nd Armored Division would initially launch diversionary attacks elsewhere to draw attention from Sharon's operations at Deversoir. Thereafter the division would hold and secure the corridor and bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E

5|$|The usual tomb plan {{consisted}} of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun god into the underworld) to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs, <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> turn 90 degrees at least once (such as KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV), and the earliest ones had cartouche-shaped burial chambers (for example, KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV). This layout is known as 'Bent Axis', After the burial the upper corridors {{were meant to be}} filled with rubble and the entrance to the tomb hidden. After the Amarna Period, the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate 'Jogged Axis' (the tomb of Horemheb, KV57 is typical of this {{and is one of the}} tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally 'Straight Axis' of the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasty tombs (Ramesses III's and Ramesses IX's tombs, KV11 and KV6 respectively). As the tombs' axes straightened, the slopes also lessened. They almost disappeared in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Another feature that is common to most tombs is the 'well', which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters from entering the lower parts of the tomb. It seems to have developed a 'magical' purpose later on as a symbolic shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated, but the well room was still present.|$|E
