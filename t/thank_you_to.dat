500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able to give it away.

500|$|The {{appearance}} of DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy was kept a secret, {{with the character}} only being referred to in scripts as [...] "Admiral". While Roddenberry had wanted Kelley to appear, {{he thought that the}} actor would turn him down. The two had lunch together and Roddenberry suggested the appearance, with Kelley agreeing not only to appear, but also that he wouldn't take anything more than the Screen Actor's Guild base salary for the part. He later said, [...] "I just wanted scale, to let it be my way of saying <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Gene for the many good things he has done for me".|$|E

Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, {{as part of a}} personal tradition of honouring others, brought a copy of the story to space when he travelled to the International Space Station in 2009 and later presented the copy to Carrier. Of the story, Thirsk said: [...] "It represents part of Canadian literacy, it represents support of reading and I just wanted to say <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Carrier." [...] The story has also been set to music by composer Abigail Richardson-Schulte as part of a piece commissioned by the Toronto Symphony, the Calgary Philharmonic and National Arts Centre Orchestras in 2012.|$|E

500|$|A snippet of [...] "Freedom" [...] {{appeared}} online on 1 June 2011 {{as part of}} {{an advertising}} campaign for the Nokia N8. In July 2011, the Sugababes released a teaser of the song online, while the full version premiered online in August 2011. [...] "Freedom" [...] was due to be officially released on 5 September 2011, although the date was pushed back to 25 September. The song was made available to pre-order on the iTunes Store, however, four days before its release date, the pre-order link was removed and [...] "Freedom" [...] was cancelled as an official single. Instead, the song was released as a free digital download via Amazon. The decision was clarified in a statement posted on the Sugababes' official Facebook page: [...] "As a <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> their fans, the Sugababes are offering their new single, 'Freedom' as a free download via Amazon." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{following}} episode of Raw, Ric Flair made his farewell speech, {{which led to}} Triple H introducing various people from Flair's past, such as the Four Horsemen, Ricky Steamboat, and others, each coming out to give an emotional farewell. Afterward, the entire WWE roster came out to say <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Flair (Including Undertaker, who came out after Raw went off the air and hugged Flair and did his kneeling stance). Shawn Michaels, who was clearly upset about retiring Flair, was forgiven by Flair. Despite Flair's forgiveness, his former protégé Batista later started a feud with Michaels, citing Michaels' [...] "selfishness" [...] at WrestleMania for not lying down for Flair. The two had a match booked at Backlash, WWE's next scheduled pay-per-view event, and after a confrontation between Michaels and Chris Jericho, Jericho was later added into the match as a Special Guest Referee. Michaels won with a superkick.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{featured}} a new character {{created by the}} winner of the [...] "Best. Character. Ever." [...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the men want to be" [...] and [...] "something like a Casanova." [...] Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> loyal fans." [...] He also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again. Another change was to air The Simpsons in 720p high-definition television with the episode [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] on February 15, 2009. With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence. It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction {{since the beginning of the}} show's second season in 1990; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro. This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over Springfield.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} a new character {{created by the}} winner of the [...] "Best. Character. Ever."

The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the men want to be". Black's inspiration for the character came from {{the fact that there were}} no characters like him on The Simpsons, and she thought Springfield needed [...] "something like a Casanova". As part of the winning prize, Black was sent to work with the show's producers in Los Angeles. She worked with the animators to bring the character to life. In an interview with the Associated Press, Black stated she [...] "described the character and they drew him so I could see if that was my vision of him". She continued, [...] "It's amazing to see how they captured what I imagined. He's over the top." [...] Executive producer Al Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> loyal fans". Jean also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again although this seems unlikely since the character appears to have been killed in a fiery car crash.|$|E
500|$|The fandom is {{considered}} to be charitable, raising money for a number of different efforts. The Brony Thank You Fund was originally established to create a fan-funded advertisement to air on Hub Network as a <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the show's creators in November 2012. The charitable drive far exceeded its goal, with additional funds used to give money to provide toys for children through Toys For Tots. The fund has since incorporated in the state of New Hampshire, and successfully registered as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization under United States law. They claim to be the first such media-related fandom to achieve this status. In December 2013, the Fund donated $50,000 to endow an animation scholarship in perpetuity at the California Institute of the Arts. [...] Similarly, a group called [...] "Bronies for Good" [...] ran blood drives and raised over $60,000 during 2012 for charities like the Children's Cancer Association, Room to Read, CureSearch, and Your Siblings. Voice actress Tara Strong has gained help from the fandom for her [...] "Kiki's Cancer Fund" [...] to help the daughter of a close friend who had been diagnosed with a brain tumor, and has stated that the child [...] "wouldn't be alive today without the My Little Pony fans"; raising $100,000 to help [...] however, the girl subsequently died of her illness. Faust enlisted help from the bronies {{to raise money for the}} Wildlife Learning Center in California, with the Center offering to name some of its animals after characters in the show when certain donation levels were raised.|$|E
500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E

2500|$|Co-writer Jack Trevino {{explained}} how so many actors from the series had {{been willing to}} participate: [...] "Trek actors have a special relationship with their fans... they regarded the project, not only as the ultimate <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Gene Roddenberry and the original stars of Trek, but as a <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> [...] who supported the series over the last 40 years." [...] Executive producer Douglas Conway had tried to assemble more of the original series cast, but when George Takei (Hikaru Sulu) was not available, this led to the idea of including Ruck's character as captain.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Crystal {{appeared}} on Inside the Actors Studio and fondly recalled that, after the Oscar ceremony, Palance approached {{him during the}} reception: [...] "He stopped me and put his arms out and went, 'Billy Crystal, who {{thought it would be}} you?'

[...] He then names three of the main session musicians on Ringo – fellow drummer Jim Keltner, Voormann and keyboard player Nicky Hopkins – before similarly thanking Harrison, ex-Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney, producer Richard Perry, sound engineer Bill Schnee, and songwriter Vince Poncia.|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{break out}} in hives if I had to sing ("Stairway to Heaven") in every show.

I sang it at the Atlantic Records show because I'm an old softie {{and it was my}} way of saying <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Atlantic because I've been with them for 20 years.

2500|$|Accepting the Award, Mr Eastwood said: [...] "Any kind of {{association}} with John Ford is most directors' dream, {{as he was}} certainly a pioneer of American filmmaking and I grew up on his films.
