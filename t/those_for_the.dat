5|$|The Engineering Department had no {{mandate to}} archive the {{programme}} videotapes they held, although typically {{they would not}} be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes. The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> serial The Highlanders, which were erased on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further erasing and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master videotape of the programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1968 serial Fury from the Deep, in late 1974.|$|E

5|$|A PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Oblivion was {{released}} on March 20, 2007 in North America, and April 27, 2007 in Europe, following delays similar to <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Xbox 360 release. The PlayStation 3 release was touted for its improvement over the graphics of the PC and Xbox 360 versions, {{although some of the}} improved shader routines optimized for the PlayStation 3 release were set to be ported over to the other releases through patches. A plan to distribute content through downloads paid by micropayment was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it was an}} open trial, the 500-page {{indictment}} was {{not made}} public. Media representatives petitioned for its release, but it was denied by judge Viriato Manuel Pinheiro de Lima, who said it would affect witnesses' thoughts and testimony. The prosecution charged Ao with having received {{millions of dollars in}} kickbacks for contracts, including <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dome constructed for the 2005 East Asian Games, the Venetian and the Galaxy StarWorld Hotel, from Ho Meng-fai, Chairman of San Meng Fai Engineering and Construction Company.|$|E
5|$|Australians Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist with Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara {{lead the}} {{individual}} fielding records. Ponting {{is the leading}} fielder in terms of catches made, in both an individual World Cup tournament and in the competition's history. Wicketkeeper Gilchrist has made the most dismissals in a single match and individual tournament, while Sangakkara has the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in World Cup history. Australia hold several team records, including <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most wins, the highest win percentage, the most consecutive wins; they were undefeated in the 2003 Cricket World Cup and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{was constructed}} in six sections, each consisting of several sub-sections. One of the main criteria {{of the project was}} that Australian industries contribute to at least 60% of the work; by the conclusion of the project 70% of the construction and 45% of the software preparation had been completed by Australian-owned companies. Work was sub-contracted out to 426companies across twelve countries, plus numerous sub-sub-contractors. In many cases, components for the first submarine were constructed by companies outside Australia, while <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following five boats were replicated by an Australian-owned partner or subsidiary. The project prompted major increases in quality control standards across Australian industries: in 1980, only 35Australian companies possessed the appropriate quality control certifications for Defence projects, but by 1998 this had increased to over 1,500.|$|E

5|$|Figures for troops {{involved}} in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They {{should be treated}} with caution, especially <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Carthaginian side. The Carthaginian army {{was a combination of}} warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000-50,000. Along with the core of an estimated 8,000 Libyans, there were 8,000 Iberians, 16,000 Gauls (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and around 5,500 Gaetulian infantry. Hannibal's cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 Numidian, 2,000 Iberian, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-Phoenician cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had around 8,000 skirmishers consisting of Balearic slingers and mixed-nationality spearmen. The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been the}} franchise's {{starting}} quarterback for 13 seasons (longer {{than any other}} Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds {{the record for the}} most starts in a Vikings jersey, and <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most wins and ties. He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers of attempts, completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage. However, Tarkenton has also thrown the most interceptions. The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
