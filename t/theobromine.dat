5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause <b>theobromine</b> poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate may be {{a factor}} for {{heartburn}} in some people because one of its constituents, <b>theobromine,</b> may affect the oesophageal sphincter muscle, hence permitting stomach acidic contents {{to enter into the}} oesophagus. <b>Theobromine</b> is also toxic to some animals unable to metabolize it (see <b>theobromine</b> poisoning).|$|E
25|$|<b>Theobromine</b> (12%): Dilates {{blood vessels}} and {{increases}} urine volume. <b>Theobromine</b> is also the principal alkaloid in the cocoa bean (chocolate).|$|E
25|$|<b>Theobromine</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1841 in cacao beans by Russian chemist Alexander Voskresensky. Synthesis of <b>theobromine</b> from xanthine was first reported in 1882 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E
25|$|Many human {{foods are}} {{somewhat}} toxic to cats; <b>theobromine</b> in chocolate can cause <b>theobromine</b> poisoning, for instance, although few cats will eat chocolate. Toxicity in cats ingesting relatively {{large amounts of}} onions or garlic has also been reported.|$|E
25|$|Tea also {{contains}} {{small amounts of}} <b>theobromine</b> and theophylline, which are stimulants, and xanthines similar to caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Cocoa solids are {{a source}} of {{flavonoids}} and alkaloids, such as <b>theobromine,</b> phenethylamine and caffeine. Chocolate also contains anandamide.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{preparation}} and {{usage of the}} black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous. Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was <b>theobromine,</b> an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more <b>theobromine</b> than yaupon.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate is {{a common}} cause of {{poisoning}} in dogs. The toxic principles in chocolate are <b>theobromine</b> and caffeine. Baker's chocolate {{is the most dangerous}} form since it contains higher concentrations of these drugs, followed by semi-sweet, dark, and then milk chocolate. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, difficulty walking, seizures, and heart problems.|$|E
25|$|White chocolate, {{although}} {{similar in}} texture {{to that of}} milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate at all. Because it does not contain any cocoa solids, white chocolate does not contain any <b>theobromine,</b> {{so it can be}} consumed by animals.|$|E
25|$|Tea {{contains}} {{small amounts}} of <b>theobromine</b> and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors {{have a significant impact}} on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, gyokuro, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong, which has very little.|$|E
25|$|In general, cocoa is {{considered}} to be a rich source of antioxidants such as procyanidins and flavanoids, which may impart antiaging properties. Cocoa also contain a high level of flavonoids, specifically epicatechin, which may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Cocoa is a stimulant and contains the compounds <b>theobromine</b> and caffeine. The beans contain between 0.1% and 0.7% caffeine, whereas dry coffee beans are about 1.2% caffeine.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} cocoa bean use comes from residue {{found in an}} ancient Mayan pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl, often seasoned with vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote. Xocolatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the <b>theobromine</b> and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and cocoa beans were often used as currency.|$|E
25|$|Theophylline, {{also known}} as 1,3-dimethylxanthine, is a methylxanthine drug used in therapy for {{respiratory}} diseases such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma under a variety of brand names. As a member of the xanthine family, it bears structural and pharmacological similarity to <b>theobromine</b> and caffeine, and is readily found in nature, and is present in tea (Camellia sinensis) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao). A small amount of theophylline is one of the products of caffeine metabolic processing in the liver.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{derived from}} cocoa beans {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of <b>theobromine</b> and theophylline, as well as caffeine. A typical 28-gram serving of a milk chocolate bar has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, dark chocolate has one to two times the amount of caffeine as coffee: 80–160mg per 100g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200mg per 100g approximately and thus, a 100 gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195mg caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine is also {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of <b>theobromine</b> and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists {{working at}} Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture {{settlement}} {{located near the}} modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle {{on one side and}} a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain <b>theobromine,</b> caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.|$|E
500|$|Wellard is {{reported}} to the police when he bites local café owner Ian Beale on the buttocks. He is taken away, with {{the possibility that he}} will be euthanised, but Gus and Deano Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) launch a campaign to save him, under the moniker [...] "Walford One Owed Freedom" [...] (WOOF). When Wellard is put on trial, Ian's partner Jane (Laurie Brett) presents character witness statements for the dog, written by Ian's children, Lucy (Melissa Suffield) and Peter (Thomas Law). Wellard is found guilty, but {{as a result of the}} statements, Gus is allowed to take him home as long as he keeps him on a lead at all times. When Gus leaves Walford to travel with his girlfriend Keisha (Suzie McGrath), he leaves Wellard with his friend Mickey Miller (Joe Swash). Mickey sells Wellard to Vinnie Monks (Bobby Davro), who intends to give him to his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). When it transpires Shirley does not want him, Vinnie gives Wellard to the Jackson family. Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) feeds Wellard a chocolate, causing him to suffer from <b>theobromine</b> poisoning. He has to be euthanised, is cremated, and has his ashes scattered on the local allotment.|$|E

2500|$|Cocoa within {{chocolate}} contains <b>theobromine,</b> {{a chemical}} stimulant that, together with caffeine and theophylline, {{belongs to the}} group of methylxanthine alkaloids. Dogs are unable to metabolize <b>theobromine</b> effectively. If they eat chocolate, the <b>theobromine</b> can remain in their bloodstreams for days, and dogs may experience fast heart rate, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death. [...] "One ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight is a potentially lethal dose in dogs." [...] In case of accidental intake of chocolate by especially a smaller dog, contact a veterinarian or animal poison control immediately; it is commonly recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion. If chocolate ingestion is suspected (mostly dark or baking chocolate), hydrogen peroxide can be used to safely induce vomiting, then making a trip to the veterinarian is suggested. Large breeds are less susceptible to chocolate poisoning, but can still die after eating four ounces of chocolate.|$|E
2500|$|Milk {{chocolate}} is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain {{a minimum of}} 20% total dry cocoa solids; {{in the rest of}} the European Union, the minimum is 25%. [...] "White chocolate" [...] contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Chocolate contains alkaloids such as <b>theobromine</b> and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of <b>theobromine</b> renders it toxic to some animals, such as dogs and cats. Chocolate contains [...] "brain cannabinoids" [...] such as anandamide, N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine. Dark chocolate has been promoted for unproven health benefits.|$|E
2500|$|The differing {{perceptions}} in {{the effects}} of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine {{could be explained by}} the fact that these beverages also contain [...] varying mixtures of other methylxanthine alkaloids, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and <b>theobromine,</b> and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Theobromine,</b> {{formerly}} known as xantheose, is a bitter alkaloid of the cacao plant, with the chemical formula C7H8N4O2. It is found in chocolate, {{as well as in}} a number of other foods, including the leaves of the tea plant, and the kola (or cola) nut. It is classified as a xanthine alkaloid, which also include the similar compounds theophylline and caffeine. [...] The compounds differ in that caffeine has an extra methyl group (see under Pharmacology section).|$|E
2500|$|The {{stimulant}} {{activity of}} cocoa {{comes from the}} compound <b>theobromine</b> which is less diuretic as compared to theophylline found in tea. Prolonged intake of flavanol-rich cocoa {{has been linked to}} cardiovascular health benefits, though this refers to raw cocoa and to a lesser extent, dark chocolate, since flavonoids degrade during cooking and alkalizing processes. Short-term benefits in LDL cholesterol levels from dark chocolate consumption have been found. The addition of whole milk to milk chocolate reduces the overall cocoa content per ounce while increasing saturated fat levels. [...] Although one study has concluded that milk impairs the absorption of polyphenolic flavonoids, e.g. epicatechin, a followup failed to find the effect.|$|E
2500|$|Alkaloids are {{produced}} by a large variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. They can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by acid-base extraction. [...] Alkaloids have {{a wide range of}} pharmacological activities including antimalarial (e.g. quinine), antiasthma (e.g. ephedrine), anticancer (e.g. homoharringtonine), cholinomimetic (e.g. galantamine), vasodilatory (e.g. vincamine), antiarrhythmic (e.g. quinidine), analgesic (e.g. morphine), antibacterial (e.g. chelerythrine), and antihyperglycemic activities (e.g. piperine). [...] Many have found use in traditional or modern medicine, or as starting points for drug discovery. [...] Other alkaloids possess psychotropic (e.g. psilocin) and stimulant activities (e.g. cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, <b>theobromine),</b> and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs. Alkaloids can be toxic too (e.g. atropine, tubocurarine). [...] Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste.|$|E
2500|$|Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethyl-xanthine) is the {{alkaloid}} most {{present in}} green and roasted coffee beans. The content of caffeine is between 1.0% and 2.5% by weight of dry green coffee beans. The content of caffeine {{does not change}} during maturation of green coffee beans. Lower concentrations of theophylline, <b>theobromine,</b> paraxanthine, liberine, and methylliberine can be found. The concentration of theophylline, an alkaloid noted for its presence in green tea, is reduced during the roasting process, usually about 15 minutes at , whereas the concentrations of most other alkaloids are not changed. The solubility of caffeine in water increases with temperature and {{with the addition of}} chlorogenic acids, citric acid, or tartaric acid, all of which are present in green coffee beans.

2500|$|To make 1kg (2.2lb) of chocolate, about 300 to 600 {{beans are}} processed, {{depending}} on the desired cocoa content. In a factory, the beans are roasted. Next, they are cracked and then deshelled by a [...] "winnower". The resulting pieces of beans are called nibs. They are sometimes sold in small packages at specialty stores and markets {{to be used in}} cooking, snacking, and chocolate dishes. Since nibs are directly from the cocoa tree, they contain high amounts of <b>theobromine.</b> Most nibs are ground, using various methods, into a thick, creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. [...] This [...] "liquor" [...] is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in (more) cocoa butter and sugar (and sometimes vanilla and lecithin as an emulsifier), and then refined, conched and tempered. [...] Alternatively, it can be separated into cocoa powder and cocoa butter using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. This process produces around 50% cocoa butter and 50% cocoa powder. Standard cocoa powder has a fat content around 10–12%. Cocoa butter is used in chocolate bar manufacture, other confectionery, soaps, and cosmetics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Theobromine</b> and {{caffeine}} {{are similar}} {{in that they are}} related alkaloids. <b>Theobromine</b> is weaker in both its inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and its antagonism of adenosine receptors. [...] Therefore, <b>theobromine</b> has a lesser impact on the human central nervous system than caffeine. <b>Theobromine</b> stimulates the heart to a greater degree. While <b>theobromine</b> is not as addictive, it has been cited as possibly causing addiction to chocolate. <b>Theobromine</b> has also been identified as one of the compounds contributing to chocolate's reputed role as an aphrodisiac.|$|E
