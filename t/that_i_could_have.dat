500|$|From 1690 onwards, William {{was often}} absent from England on campaign, each year {{generally}} {{from the spring}} until the autumn. In 1690, he fought Jacobites (who supported James) in Ireland, and whilst her husband was away, Mary administered {{the government of the}} realm with the advice of a nine-member Cabinet Council. She was not keen to assume power and felt [...] "deprived of all that was dear to me in the person of my husband, left among those that were perfect strangers to me: my sister of a humour so reserved <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> little comfort from her." [...] Anne had quarrelled with William and Mary over money, and {{the relationship between the two}} sisters had soured.|$|E

The physical and technical demands of this style of playing require Stetson to adhere to a fitness routine that includes running, yoga, breathing exercises and meditation. During {{the course of his}} career, his playing proficiency had been developing and each album in the New History Warfare trilogy marked a musical progression from the last. By the time he recorded New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light, Stetson's playing capability had improved to such a level that he claimed [...] "there’s almost nothing in there <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> played when I recorded Vol. 2."The X Factor: FACT meets the remarkable Colin Stetson|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/04/23/free-jazz-war-stories-and-the-x-factor-fact-meets-the-remarkable-colin-stetson/|work=Fact|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=23 April 2013}} ...|$|E

500|$|Within {{his first}} year on Coronation Street, Thompson had acted out scenes that {{involved}} his character stealing a car, graffiting {{the wall of the}} local newsagents, and discovering that his mother's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend. Still impressed with Thompson's acting ability, producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009. Reflecting on {{his first year}} in the soap, Thompson said: [...] "It's been a really strange year and a lot of things have happened. It's been absolutely brilliant. The filming is everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wanted it to be. It's fantastic and I enjoy it more than anything." [...] He added: [...] "My favourite story lines so far have been doing the graffiti and stealing the car. I really enjoyed filming those two." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of the {{commander}} of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air raid over Rabaul in January 1943, the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a replacement. The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. [...] "I had {{a lot of confidence in}} him," [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "and believed he would do a real job for me. Arnold replied the next day <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> him." [...] Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker, Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing. These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943.|$|E
500|$|He spent £300,000 on midfielder Chris Birchall for {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season. His team started well, however midway through the campaign, {{following}} a run of five games without defeat, Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form. A 5–0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion began a sequence of eight games without a win, including six defeats. This culminated in a 2–0 home defeat to Bristol City in the FA Cup, a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena. On 17 January 2007, the day after the cup exit, the club parted company with Adams, with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship. Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible. He admitted that the sale of Gary McSheffrey to Birmingham City had been a turning point in the club's season, but also said that [...] "I genuinely believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> turned it around" [...] and [...] "I tried my best and that's all I can do." ...|$|E

500|$|After being {{recognized}} as 1928 national champions, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team struggled {{during the next}} two season. Georgia Tech football coach William Alexander began looking for a new assistant. During 1930 football season, Alexander sent his line coach, Mac Tharpe, to scout future opponent North Carolina, playing Tennessee in Knoxville. Tharpe's car broke down {{and by the time he}} reached Knoxville, the game was over. Tharpe asked Tennessee head coach Bob Neyland for information, who suggested that he talk to Dodd. When Tharpe returned to Atlanta he told Alexander: [...] "Dodd's analysis of Carolina is better than any scouting report <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> made." [...] Alexander was also impressed by reports of Dodd's performance during games. Dodd joined Alexander's staff as an assistant coach on December 28, 1930. Dodd served as an assistant coach at Tech for 14 years, even though he received many offers for head coaching positions from other schools during that time frame. Dodd lionized Coach Alexander which was later reflected in his coaching style. [...] "He taught me to treat athletes as men, not boys – to never use their failings as an alibi for a loss", Dodd said.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry Charles and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of the episodes in Season 2. [...] "The Statue" [...] was the second episode Charles wrote for the show, though {{it was the first}} to be aired. Charles was mostly interested {{in the development of the}} Kramer character, as he felt [...] "Jerry and George were so well-defined through Larry [...] and Jerry, that there was less room for me to, sort of, expand on those personas. But Kramer was very unformed at the beginning of the show and it gave me an area of creativity to, sort of, expand upon. So I spent a lot of time with Kramer because he was a character <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> an impact on in the future of the show". Richards enjoyed how his character evolved and, after the filming of the episode, went to Seinfeld, Charles and David and said [...] "we should keep going that way." [...] He cites this episode, as well as [...] "The Revenge" [...] (in which Kramer puts concrete in a washing machine), as episodes that really defined the character.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor's {{first job}} {{was as a}} {{waitress}} at age 15, although it lasted only a week. As a teenager, she struggled with her weight: [...] "I had every issue related to weight <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have.</b> I was unhealthy, I had bad skin, and I had hair growing on my face!" [...] Kapoor was diagnosed with insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian disease, and has since begun an initiative to increase awareness of diabetes. Kapoor enrolled at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore for her pre-university education, where she studied theatre and arts. She has said she later started courses in economics and political science through University of Mumbai correspondence programme, [...] after returning from University of East London where she began her bachelor's degree in the same subjects but returned to Mumbai soon after she began. The actress Rani Mukerji, a family friend, visited her family in Singapore on holiday while working on Black (2005). Kapoor, who had originally {{wanted to be a}} director and writer, expressed a desire to work as a crew member on the film. On her father's recommendation to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, she was appointed as his assistant.|$|E

500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

[...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster." [...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty." [...] "Cece's Interlude" [...] has a Prince-like LinnDrum and transparent lyrics addressing a girl: [...] "I wish I / Wasn't famous / I wish I / Was still in school / So <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> you in my dorm room / I would put it on you crazy." [...] The pop song [...] "Find Your Love" [...] was produced by Kanye West and bears similarity to his 2008 song [...] "Heartless".|$|E

[...] Having trekked [...] without clean water, the party's stock had grown extremely thirsty. The supply at Cataract Canyon was limited, and it contained what Udell called [...] "wigglers"; however, they {{had no choice but to}} drink from, and allow their animals to drink from, the less than ideal source. By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building casks out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, [...] "Our water still holds out... like the widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us." ...|$|E
