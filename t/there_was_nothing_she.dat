500|$|The stab victim {{dies and}} Maddy blames herself, even though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could have done. [...] But Ric tells Maddy he has reconsidered {{and she can}} have an interview. Although she's happy to have this {{opportunity}} she knows that Ric is only doing it to avoid a court case.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{relieved}} that war was over, Alice was {{appalled by the}} behaviour of Prussian troops in Hesse; Berlin took the grand duchy's railways and telegraph systems, and assessed Hesse for three million florins in indemnity. Alice wrote to her mother, who in turn wrote to Princess Victoria, who responded that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could do to relieve the [...] "painful and distressing position darling Alice was in", as it was [...] "one of the unavoidable results of this dreadful war". Influence came from the Emperor of Russia, who urged the Prussian King to allow the Grand Duke to keep his throne. The facts that the Emperor's mother was the Grand Duke's aunt, and Alice's sister being also the Prussian Crown Princess {{are likely to have}} influenced Prussia's generosity. However, Alice was angered by an untactful visit by Princess Victoria to the conquered region of Homburg, originally part of Hesse, shortly after it became Prussian territory.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think I should enjoy it,' {{replied the}} hen doubtfully. 'And I don't think the cat {{would like it}} either.' And the cat, when asked, agreed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> would hate so much.|$|E

50|$|Milly Millimurra, Jimmy's sister, who {{has three}} children. She stands {{up for what}} she {{believes}} is right and does her best {{to care for her}} children. She dislikes being treated badly, but realises <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if Daisy feels up to it--" [...] said Mrs. Miller, {{in a tone}} {{impregnated}} with a {{sense of}} the magnitude of the enterprise. [...] "It seems as if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't undertake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear colonel,' said Lord Montacute, 'on the contrary, {{there is}} nothing more {{interesting}} to them. Miss Mountjoy was saying only yesterday, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> found so difficult to understand as the account of a battle, and how much she wished to comprehend it.' ...|$|E
60|$|As the day wore on, the life-blood {{seemed to}} ebb away from Ursula, {{and within the}} {{emptiness}} a heavy despair gathered. Her passion seemed to bleed to death, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> sat suspended {{in a state of}} complete nullity, harder to bear than death.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> hates like a Fotheringham; {{but she has}} not {{the power}} over my father she once had. She {{will have to take}} up with us for very spite. But what they are to live on I do not know, unless my father keeps them.' ...|$|R
50|$|Lidi: A Terran; seventy-two Earth-years old and not {{interested}} in grandmothering. Lidi had been navigating for fifty years, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> doesn't know about NAFAL (nearly as fast as light) ships, although occasionally she forgets that their ship is the Shoby and calls it the Soso or the Alterra.|$|R
500|$|The Upanishad, in verses 26 to 28, {{asserts that}} Devi is [...] "Unknowable, the Endless, the Incomprehensible, the Unknown, the One and the Many." [...] The Upanishad states that Devi is the fountainhead of all mantras. All {{knowledge}} is her inherent characteristic, beyond her <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{the pilot of}} worldly life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I can {{venture to}} say the poor {{appreciate}} them, too," [...] Hilda answered, bridling up a little--for <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> hated so much as class-prejudices. [...] "Besides, they need sympathy more; they have fewer comforts. I should not care to give up attending my poor people {{for the sake of}} the idle rich." ...|$|E
60|$|But this {{improbable}} iniquity he had committed, and now <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> {{could not}} believe of him. In the first place it was quite manifest that he was tipsy; in the next place {{it was to be}} taken as proved that all his religion was sheer hypocrisy; and finally the man was utterly shameless. She therefore stood watching for the sound of his footfall, not without some fear that he might creep out at her suddenly from among the bushes.|$|E
60|$|One {{important}} {{result of}} the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking {{almost as if they}} wanted tit-bits to eat.|$|E
50|$|Thaïle, a Gifted pixie in mysterious Thume, stands Death Watch over a neighbor, and {{receives}} her first Word of power.

50|$|Mrs. Dalton: Mary Dalton's mother. Her {{blindness}} {{serves to}} accentuate the motif of racial blindness throughout the story. Both Bigger and Max comment on how people are blind {{to the reality of}} race in America. Mrs. Dalton betrays her metaphorical blindness when she meets Mrs. Thomas. Mrs. Dalton hides behind her philanthropy and claims <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can do for Bigger.|$|R
5000|$|He takes Clotilde {{dancing at}} a raucous nightspot. The singer there sings [...] "Bel Ami", {{which is about}} a scoundrel. Clotilde calls Georges Bel Ami; he {{promises}} to live up (or down) to that name. While they are out one night, Rachel spots them and makes a scene. Afterward, Clotilde writes Georges a letter in which she confesses she loves him so much that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> cannot forgive him.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> did {{not think}} of during these character-forming days. The beauty and peace of love, the {{physical}} joy of it; the problem of marriage, the terror of birth--all the things girls are supposed not to think of, and which such girls as Rose must irresistibly think of, came to her, tormenting her, shaking her to the inmost center of her nature, and through it all she seemed quite the hearty young school girl she was, for this thought was wholesome and natural, not morbid in any degree.|$|E
6000|$|For {{two years}} she had been meeting Mr. Brumley as {{confidently}} {{as though they had}} been invisible beings, and now she had to rack her brains for just what might be mistaken, what might be misconstrued. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> told herself, nothing, it was all as open as the day, and still her mind groped about for some forgotten circumstance, something gone almost out of memory that would bear misinterpretation.... How should she begin? [...] "Isaac," [...] she would say, [...] "I am being followed about London." [...] Suppose he denied his complicity! How could he deny his complicity? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She, and {{pardon me}} for repeating, was amazing. It {{is the one}} {{adequate}} word. Even the most minor adjectives applicable to her {{are bound to be}} sheer superlatives. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could not do better than any woman and than most men. Sing, play--bah!--as some rhetorician once said of old Nap, competition fled from her. Swim! She could have made a fortune and a name as a public performer. She was one of those rare women who can strip off all the frills of dress, and in simple swimming suit be more satisfying beautiful. Dress! She was an artist.|$|E
60|$|He {{said it in}} a kiss. We had {{a moment}} of {{exquisite}} forgetfulness of the hard ways of life--a moment of delicious absorption in each other. I came back to realities fortified and composed, rewarded for all that I had gone through, ready {{to go through it}} all over again for another kiss. Only give a woman love, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> will not venture, suffer, and do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is there?' He turns interestedly {{towards the}} table, but his proud Scots {{character}} checks him, {{which is just}} as well, for what she should have said <b>was</b> that <b>there</b> had <b>been</b> winkles. 'Not me. You're just a common rogue.' He seats himself far from the table. 'Now, then, out with it. Sit down!' <b>She</b> sits meekly; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> would not do for him. 'As you char, I suppose you are on your feet all day.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Reinhart's neo {{soul and}} R sounds have been {{compared}} to those of her modern contemporaries like Adele, Duffy, and Amy Winehouse, while her retro pop, disco, and jazz sounds have been equated to Nancy Sinatra, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Aretha Franklin, and other Motown artists. Atwood Magazine further attributed Haley [...] "with the wild side of Janis Joplin, the class of Ella Fitzgerald, and the cutting-edge influence of Etta James, which proves that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can’t do." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{a terrible}} state of things for Rosie. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could do; and to sit still and wait was torture {{to one of her}} restless, {{energetic}} mind. When her mistress was out of the house she could give vent to her spite by getting into Fan's room and teasing her in every way that her malice suggested. But Fan usually locked her out, and would not even open the door to take in her dinner when it was brought; then Rosie would wait until it was cold before leaving it on the landing.|$|E
60|$|As to Adeline, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> dreaded {{so much as}} {{the commotion}} that would be excited if Ivinghoe's flirtation came to any crisis. His mother would never forgive her, his father would hardly do so; she would feel like a traitor to the whole family, and all her {{attempts}} to put a check on endeavours on Maura's part to draw him on- —an endeavour that began to be visible to her-—were met by apparent unconsciousness or by tears. And when she ventured a word to her husband, he gruffly answered that his niece's father had been an officer in the army, and he could make it worth any one's while to take her! Young lords were glad enough in these days to have something to put into their pockets.|$|E
60|$|These {{words he}} spoke to her quite abruptly. When he first said that he wished to speak to her, she had got up from her chair to welcome him, for she dearly loved to have him there. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> liked better than having him to herself {{when he was in}} a soft brotherly humour; and then she would {{interest}} herself about his horse, and his dogs, and his gun, and predict his life for him, sending him up as a peer to Parliament, and giving him a noble wife, and promising him that he should be such a Desmond as would redeem all the family from their distresses. But now as he rapidly brought out his words, she found that on this day her prophecies must regard herself chiefly.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you afraid}} of?" [...] she asked contemptuously. [...] "Jeanne {{suspects}} <b>nothing,</b> of course. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> which <b>she</b> could suspect. She has not mentioned his name even." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, indeed I do,' said Mrs. Woodbourne, 'she {{is a most}} kind-hearted creature. I {{really believe}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> would not do for the {{children}} or me, I {{do not know what}} would become of me without her: but you know her way of speaking, she does not mean any harm; but still when people are not used to her, it vexes them; indeed I did not mean to say anything against her, she is a most excellent creature, quite her Papa's right hand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then my lord the King said, [...] "Praised {{and blessed}} be {{the name of}} our God Malcometto, who has given my soul for comfort that which it desired. Truly <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not a franker lady under {{the wheel of the}} sun; and by the body of my mother I swear <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can ask that I will not freely give. First of the maidens she desires shall be my {{daughter}} Florence." [...] Then all his lords rose, man by man, and gladly named each his child.|$|R
60|$|The hours flew away, {{loitering}} in the park, roaming in the woods. They met Mistress Pauncefort and {{her friends}} loaded with plunder, and they offered to Venetia a trophy of their success; but when Venetia, merely to please their kind hearts, accepted their tribute with cordiality, and declared <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> liked better, Lord Cadurcis would not be satisfied unless he immediately commenced nutting, and each moment he bore to Venetia the produce of his sport, till in time she could scarcely sustain the rich and increasing burden. At length they bent their steps towards home, sufficiently wearied to look forward with welcome to rest and their repast, yet not fatigued, and exhilarated by the atmosphere, for the sun was now in its decline, though in this favoured season there were yet hours enough remaining of enchanting light.|$|E
60|$|Already {{the people}} of Vaucouleurs {{had given her a}} horse and had armed and {{equipped}} her as a soldier. She got no chance to try the horse and see if she could ride it, for her great first duty was to abide at her post and lift up the hopes and spirits of all who would come to talk with her, and prepare them to help in the rescue and regeneration of the kingdom. This occupied every waking moment she had. But it was no matter. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could not learnand in the briefest time, too. Her horse would find this out in the first hour. Meantime the brothers and I took the horse in turn and began to learn to ride. And we had teaching {{in the use of the}} sword and other arms also.|$|E
60|$|But Phineas cared {{very little}} what Miss Fitzgibbon said to him. Everybody knew Aspasia Fitzgibbon, and all {{who knew her}} were {{accustomed}} {{to put up with}} the violence of her jokes and the bitterness of her remarks. She was an old maid, over forty, very plain, who, having reconciled herself to {{the fact that she was}} an old maid, chose to take advantage of such poor privileges as the position gave her. Within the last few years a considerable fortune had fallen into her hands, some twenty-five thousand pounds, which had come to her unexpectedly,--a wonderful windfall. And now she was the only one of her family who had money at command. She lived in a small house by herself, in one of the smallest streets of May Fair, and walked about sturdily by herself, and spoke her mind about everything. She was greatly devoted to her brother Laurence,--so devoted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> would not do for him, short of lending him money.|$|E
50|$|Die finds {{a lawyer}} {{willing to help}} them, but Steve drives him away due to what he {{perceives}} as the lawyer's sexual interest in Die. While at a store, Steve slits his wrist, but survives. Overwhelmed, Die attempts to commit Steve to a hospital. She regrets the decision when she sees the officials use violence and tasers to subdue Steve, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can legally do. Kyla moves to Toronto, with Die encouraging her and expressing hope for her son. Immediately after being unstrapped by hospital officials, Steve flees.|$|R
5000|$|Loring and James {{first met}} in December 1873. In 1875, James joined the Society and taught history {{alongside}} Loring, {{who was the}} head of the department. In the summer of 1879, Alice James wrote to Sara Darwin: [...] "I wish you could know Katharine Loring ... she is a most wonderful being. She has all the mere brute superiority which distinguishes man from woman combined with all the distinctively feminine virtues. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> cannot do from hewing wood and drawing water to driving runaway horses and educating all the women in North America".|$|R
60|$|The queen {{was much}} moved by this generosity, {{and she said}} that of all that <b>she</b> had lost <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> regretted so much as the power of {{rewarding}} such goodness.|$|R
