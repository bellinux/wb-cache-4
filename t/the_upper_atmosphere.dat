40|$|Several recent {{papers have}} {{reviewed}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and ionospheres of Jupiter and Saturn {{in the post}} Voyager era (see, e. g., / 1 / and references therein). Therefore, this paper will review only the most salient characteristics, as far as Jupiter and Saturn are concerned. The emphasis here, however, is placed on <b>the</b> Uranus <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> that was probed in January, 1986, by Voyager 2 spacecraft. In particular comparative aspects of atmospheric composition, thermal structure, photochemistry and the vertical mixing are discussed...|$|R
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

Various theoretical models used to interpret the planetary atmospheric data are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, the {{concentration}} of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.|$|E
5|$|November is {{traditionally}} {{the start of}} the thunderstorm season along the eastern seaboard of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool air in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> These conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms, particularly those which feature hail.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 2013, {{scientists}} at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of Titan, a possible precursor for life. On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} is {{the region}} above the ionosphere that {{is defined by}} the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. Light {{at these}} wavelengths is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> or from space. Objects emitting ultraviolet radiation include the Sun, other stars and galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) {{aboard the}} Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has {{systematically}} observed the Martian oxygen exosphere for nearly one Martian year now. The OI 130. 4 nm resonance scattering line is observed {{all the time}} at the dayside providing unprecedented information on the oxygen content of <b>the</b> Martian <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> These variations are {{important to understand the}} chemistry, dynamics, energetics and escape processes of <b>the</b> Martian <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Using a radiative transfer model, we have estimated the amount of oxygen in the Martian exosphere needed to reproduce the observations of IUVS during the first Martian year of the mission. In this work, we will present the seasonal variations of the exospheric oxygen density derived from this set of observations and discussed these variations in the frame of global models of <b>the</b> Martian <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere...</b>|$|R

5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Because the planet has only been {{detected}} indirectly, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Due to its mass {{it is likely}} to have a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|On Titan, Saturn's largest natural satellite, {{infrequent}} methane rain {{is thought}} to carve the moon's numerous surface channels.

5000|$|Direct {{experimental}} {{evidence of the}} validity of RBL theory of electric current induced nucleation of diamond as by lightning striking amourphous carbon and graphite has been observed by Yacobson on May 15, 2014 [...] wherein Yakobson and others observe the nucleation of diamond in anthacitic coal if functionalized by hydrocarbons under the exposure to the electron beam within a transmission electron microscope. Such high-voltage, electron bombardment of the anthacite in the presence of hydrogen in Yakobson's system closely mimics the conditions of electrons of lightning striking carbon in hydrogen <b>atmospheres</b> in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of Saturn and Jupiter.
