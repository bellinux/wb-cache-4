We present {{a case of a}} 54 -year-old female with history of metastatic colorectal carcinoma who had stent placement secondary to obstruction.

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only known case in which the indication for stent trimming was severe stent induced rectal pain.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the three-dimensional architecture of the brain is a fundamental condition to the anatomist and the neurosurgeon, especially during their training in basic or surgical neuroanatomy. Demonstrate through the Klingler’s technique the anatomical three-dimensional disposition of white matter tracts. According to the Klingler’s method (Atlas Cerebri Humani - The inner structure of the brain), is preconized that the material should be fresh. A solution of commercial formalin (5 %) and distilled water (95 %) should be prepared; the material should be immersed and after the course of 4 weeks immersed in the fixing solution, it {{should be placed on}} a tray in the freezer (- 10 °C) during 8 days. Once removed from the freezer, the material must remain in a formalin 3 % solution. We worked with 10 brains prepared as the previously described technique. Our main instruments are: delicate type dissecting Adson <b>forceps</b> without <b>teeth</b> and watchmaker’s <b>forceps,</b> and wooden spatulas with a diameter of 2 and 4 mm.

Enquist Corresponding author ([lenquist@princeton. edu](lenquist@princeton. edu)). ### INTRODUCTION Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a neuroinvasive virus of the herpes {{family that}} has a broad host range but does not infect higher-order primates. PRV {{characteristically}} travels along chains of synaptically connected neurons and has been used extensively for elucidating neural circuits in the peripheral and central nervous system in vivo. The recombinant virus PRV 369 is an attenuated retrograde tracer that encodes G-CaMP 2, a fluorescent calcium sensor protein that is stable at physiological pH and mammalian temperature. This protocol describes the use of PRV 369 to express G-CaMP 2 in a neuronal circuit and to monitor its activity in a living animal, specifically in the submandibular ganglia (SMG), the peripheral parasympathetic ganglia that innervate the salivary glands. The procedure describes the delivery of PRV 369 to the glands and shows how SMG neurons can then be imaged post-inoculation to explore connectivity and activity. ### RELATED INFORMATION Additional information {{on the use of}} PRVs for tracing neural circuitry in vivo is described in Song et al. (2005). Specific information on the recombinant PRV 369 is available in Granstedt et al. (2009). Background on the properties and uses of G-CaMP 2 is also available (Nakai et al. 2001; Ohkura et al. 2005; Tallini et al. 2006; Hoogland et al. 2009). PRV has a broad host range, infecting almost all mammals and some avian embryos (except higher primates including humans). Therefore, this technology is expected to work in any species susceptible to PRV infection. For an example of an SMG infected by PRV 369 and spontaneous calcium transients imaged with two-photon microscopy, see Figure 1. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Example of an SMG infected by PRV 369. Spontaneous calcium transients were imaged with two-photon microscopy 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi). Scale bar = 20 μm. ΔF/F: relative fluorescence change. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Buprenorphine (0. 3 mg/mL; e. g., Buprenex) - *Dilute the stock 20 -fold with 0. 9 % saline to a final concentration of 15 μg/mL*. - Disinfectant solution/surgical scrub (e. g., Betadine) - *Use a solution with both antiseptic microbicidal and sudsing properties*. - Ethanol (70 %) - Isoflurane - Ketamine/xylazine hydrochloride solution (80 mg/mL and 12 mg/mL, respectively; Sigma K 113) - *Dilute 10 -fold with 0. 9 % saline to a final concentration of 8 mg/mL ketamine and 1. 2 mg/mL xylazine*. - Mammalian Ringer’s solution (prewarmed) - Mice - *If another species is used, surgical conditions and drug dosages should be optimized for that species. All procedures must be approved by local animal use and welfare authorities*. - Phosphate-buffered saline (e. g., DPBS; GIBCO/Invitrogen) - PRV 369 inoculum (10 e 10 plaque-forming units [pfu]/mL) - *The inoculum can be obtained from the Enquist laboratory, Princeton University*. ### Equipment 1. Alcohol swabs - Anesthesia chamber (plastic, equipped with nose mask and filter) - Applicators (cotton-tipped) - Cardboard - <b>Forceps</b> (Adson, with <b>teeth)</b> - <b>Forceps</b> (fine, # 5) - Forceps (serrated, standard pattern) - Hamilton syringe (10 -μL, equipped with 33 -gauge needle [0. 5 -in., 20 ° bevel]) - Isoflurane vaporizer (equipped with O 2 tank and nose cone) - Microscope (dissection; e. g., Leica MZ 16) - Microscope (equipped for confocal or two-photon imaging, and with a small metal platform controlled by a micromanipulator; adapted from[Purves and Lichtman]([URL] [1987]) - Needle holders (Roboz RS- 7842) - Perfusion tubes - Razor blades - Retractors - Rodent blanket (homeothermic, equipped with rectal probe and temperature controller; e. g., Stoelting Co. 50300) - Rubber band - Scalpel handle and blade - Scissors - Scissors (stitch; Roboz RS- 5950) - Scissors (tissue-separator; Fine Science Tools 14072 - 10) - Sutures (silk, 6 - 0; e. g., Moore Medical 54114) - Syringe and needle for intraperitoneal injection - Tape ### METHOD **Injection of PRV 369 into Salivary Glands** *The procedure must be performed under Biosafety Level 2 conditions*. 1. Anesthetize the animal by injecting intraperitoneally with 16 μL ketamine/xylazine per gram of body weight. - *Wait until the animal is anesthetized by checking paw-pinch withdrawal and corneal reflexes before continuing*. - Lay the animal on its back on a piece of cardboard. Immobilize the limbs with tape. Stretch back the nose by securing a rubber band across the mouth. - Monitor the animal during the entire surgical procedure and test the depth of anesthesia regularly (e. g., by controlling respiratory rate and paw-pinch withdrawal reflex). - Using an alcohol swab, wet the neck area {{from the base of the}} chin to just above the ribcage. - Use a razor blade to shave away the hair, exposing the skin. - Use cotton-tipped applicators to apply disinfectant solution/surgical scrub to the shaved area. Finish by swabbing with 70 % ethanol. - Grasp the skin with forceps. Use a sterile scalpel to make a shallow incision ~ 1. 5 -cm long from the ribcage to the chin. - Gently detach the glands from the skin using tissue separator scissors. - The salivary glands are located immediately below the skin, and adhere to it via layers of connective tissue. - Rinse the Hamilton syringe with DPBS before drawing up PRV inoculum. - Using the Hamilton syringe, inject 5 μL of the PRV 369 into each side of the salivary glands: - i. Inject PRV into one side of the salivary gland by making two to three separate injections in the center. - ii. Keep the syringe in place for ~ 10 sec at each injection site. - iii. Repeat with the other side. - Injecting in both the left and right glands doubles the chance of finding infected cells and reduces the number of animals used. - Close the incision with silk sutures. Apply disinfectant solution to the sutured area. - For post-operative analgesia, inject 5 μL of the diluted buprenorphine per gram of body weight intraperitoneally. - Keep the mouse on a heating blanket at 37 °C until it recovers. Put the animal in a new cage by itself. **In Vivo Imaging of Fluorescent Indicator in SMG Neurons** 13. At the desired time post-inoculation, anesthetize the animal for ~ 10 min in an isoflurane chamber using 2 % isoflurane. 14. Place the animal on its back on the imaging stage. Position the animal’s nose in the isoflurane cone. Tape down all limbs. 15. Insert the rectal temperature probe. Turn on the heating blanket to keep the animal’s temperature at 37 °C. 16. Under a dissection microscope, use stitch scissors to remove the sutures. 17. Use tissue-separator scissors to separate the glands from the skin. With the aid of retractors, pull open the skin to better expose the glands. - *Healthy glands have lobules and appear pinkish gray. It is rare to detect any damage in the glands from the first surgery. Even if some inflammation occurs in the glands, it does not affect imaging in the submandibular neurons*. 18. Using fine forceps to cut connective tissue, locate the SMG anterior to one of the salivary glands. - *The SMGs are located along the salivary duct and surrounded by connective tissue. They appear as small translucent beads. Healthy ganglia should have detectable capillaries with blood flow*. 19. Lift the ganglion onto a small metal platform that is controlled by a micromanipulator. - *Apply some tension so that the ganglion stays in place*. 20. Move the stage from the dissection microscope to an upright imaging microscope. Perfuse the area with warm mammalian Ringer’s solution. 21. Image calcium transients with a one-photon wavelength of 480 nm (or two-photon excitation at 920 nm) and with a 500 - to 550 -nm bandpass emission filter. - *Labeled cells will have dim background fluorescence that fills the soma compared with nonlabeled cells. Transients are bright and can be seen in the raw movies. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Fluorescence intensity of infected cells is low. **[Step 21]** - **Solution**: The fluorescence quantum efficiency of G-CaMP 2 is only in the range of wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP) at typical intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations. As a result, infected cells might be hard to find because they are only slightly brighter than autofluorescent cells. Because excessive excitation leads to bleaching, take averaged images without increasing excitation intensity. Search for cells that are brighter than the average cell. Typical calcium signals in vivo increase the intensity by 40 % and last longer than a second, making them easily detectable. Note that bleaching accelerates when calcium (and therefore fluorescence) is elevated. ### DISCUSSION PRV 369 provides the capability to reliably detect neuronal activity by expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator protein in intact circuits in living animals. It is isogenic with PRV Bartha strains encoding GFP (PRV 152; Smith et al. 2000) and red fluorescent protein (PRV 614; Banfield et al. 2003), two of the most frequently used PRV-based viral circuit tracers. PRV 369 should therefore be useful in circuits previously elucidated by these tracers. The endogenous activity of PRV 369 -labeled neurons can be monitored early on with minimal effects caused by infection. However, at later time points in infection, the number of infected cells and calcium transient frequency increases significantly, perhaps indicating cell and tissue responses to infection (Granstedt et al. 2009). The described approach for labeling and monitoring activity in the SMGs can be generalized to other circuits. Although not all types of circuits have been explored with PRV, to our knowledge PRV has labeled every circuit tested. However, for each circuit the precise time window for reliable imaging must be determined empirically by measuring the time course of infection spread through the|$|R
