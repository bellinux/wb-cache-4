50|$|The battle began {{shortly before}} dawn with an {{artillery}} bombardment of Irish {{positions on the}} hill. Advance units quickly moved against rebel outposts under cover of the bombardment and moved artillery closer as forward positions were secured. The <b>tightening</b> <b>ring</b> forced the rebels into an ever-shrinking area and increased exposure to the constant bombardment, including new experimental delayed-fuse shells resulting in hundreds of dead and injured. At least two mass charges were launched by the rebels which failed to break {{the lines of the}} military and the situation on Vinegar Hill soon became desperate for the rebels.|$|E
5000|$|To attach {{it to the}} bicycle's main frame, the {{seatpost}} {{is inserted}} into the seat tube, which must be of a very slightly larger diameter (or a cylindrical shim can be used). The seatpost is {{held in place by}} squeezing the top of the seat tube with a <b>tightening</b> <b>ring</b> (temporarily reducing its diameter; a vertical slit cut into the tube allows this to happen without crumpling) until the tube firmly hugs the post where it leaves the frame. A hole for a pinch bolt (also known as a [...] "binder bolt") may be built into the frame for this purpose, or a [...] "seat post clamp" [...] may be purchased separately (but must be sized to closely fit the diameter of the seat tube). Whether integrated or separate, the seat post bolt can have a simple nut, can be an Allen bolt, or can include a quick-release mechanism, with a handle that releases the clamp without tools. [...] A quick-release allows easy height adjustment of the seat, though increases the risk of seat theft unless it is also used to detach the seat when parking.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of the {{combination}} of self-made or common boring bar and CNC program, we machined two external cylinders used for <b>tightening</b> <b>ring</b> (φ 500 u 6 (+ 0. 58 /+ 0. 54) × 130 mm) of a vertical roller mill, and conquered the difficulty on machining high-precision cylindrical on the boring machine. This process improvement not only brings the machining advantage of CNC machine tools into full play, but also organically integrates conventional boring to turning methods, which can cause high machining efficiency. Since the special tooling is not needed and it’s easy to obtain materials from local sources, we can adjust the process in a large range. The implementation of this processing method is meaningful for the reference and promotion of processing such short cylinder by turning on the boring machine...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} concerns {{an inflatable}} seal assembly adapted {{for use with}} a bayonet quick-disconnect system particularly useful for the insulated transfer of cryogenic consumables in orbit (such as between a space station and a re-supply vehicle). The zero-leak cryogenic coupling includes a polymeric seal clamped to a male bayonet member with two pairs of <b>tightening</b> <b>rings.</b> The <b>tightening</b> <b>rings</b> threadably engage each other in respective pairs around tapered ends of the inflatable seal member so that a wedging action tightens the seal member about the male bayonet. Once in place, the seal may be inflated via an inflation port so that its expansion provides pressure contact with the inside surface of a coaxial female member...|$|R

On 23 May, Porfirio Díaz <b>tightened</b> the <b>ring</b> around the city and advanced to Tacubaya and was confronted by the French guerrillas at Belen on 30 May who held them back until 9 June when they were called to reassemble at San Antonio Abad.|$|R
5000|$|Longeing cavesson (UK: [...] "Lungeing") is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used in longeing a horse, made of leather or nylon web. Though the longeing cavesson looks a bit like a halter, the noseband can be <b>tightened</b> and <b>rings</b> are strategically placed on the sides and {{at the front of the}} nose for attachment of a longe line or side reins. It provides much better leverage and more precise control of a horse in ground training, yet it is a relatively gentle piece of equipment.|$|R

40|$|International audienceShape Memory Alloys (SMAs) {{are widely}} {{considered}} for large range of applications in various domains as biomechanics, aeronautics, automotive, civil engineering, etc [...] . Design of such smart (adaptive) applications is mainly based on experimental analysis. In fact, most of commercial finite element codes {{did not offer}} a specific constitutive model for SMAs in their material standard databases despite the large progress made by research in this area. In fact, many interesting thermo-mechanical behavior models, well adapted to SMAs, were proposed by recognized research groups (among them Lexcellent's, Auricchio's, Patoor's, Lagoudas's group, and Moumni's groups [...] .). Those models are based either on micromechanical or on phenomenological approaches, well describe all the specificities of SMAs behavior and were successfully implemented in various commercial codes as Abaqus, Marc, Castem 2000, FemLab. This allowed analyzing by finite element method the response of applications in SMAs (stents, endodontic file, micro-actuators, springs, connection systems, damping systems). A global review of {{an example of a}} research activity illustrating these progresses in finite element based SMA application design is developed. A family of macroscopic constitutive models based on micromechanical approach and considering macroscopic material parameters and internal variables is detailed. The implementation of these models in the Abaqus finite element code via the subroutine UMAT is presented. The obtained tool was considered for design of SMA based applications in various domains as biomedical (endodontic file), connection (<b>tightening</b> <b>rings,</b> fish plates for rails) and micro-actuators showing how finite element analysis contributes in the design of such applications...|$|R
60|$|The Rowan came up head to wind, and Whitney {{was hard}} at work {{for the next few}} minutes, {{handling}} heavy chain that ran out furiously and then stopped until he dragged more up from below, paying out the thick kedge-warp that coiled all about the deck, and lashing the thrashing jib to the bowsprit. Then he and Andrew got the mainsail down and the boat rode to her moorings; though she was not at rest. Sometimes the wind drove her up against the tide and the short waves washed on deck; sometimes the current swept her back, while the <b>tightening</b> cable <b>rang</b> and it looked as if she must drag her anchors and ground upon the surf-swept bank.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} NVA history stated: [...] "On June 26, 1968, {{the enemy}} {{announced he was}} withdrawing from Khe Sanh. Our armed forces rapidly <b>tightened</b> their siege <b>ring,</b> mounted shelling attacks, suppressed the enemy's efforts to transport troops by helicopter, and conducted fierce attacks to block the overland route, forcing the enemy to prolong his withdrawal. On July 15, 1968, our soldiers were in complete control of Khe Sanh." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{taking the}} small fortresses of Pamplona, Wellington {{invested}} San Sebastián but was {{frustrated by the}} obstinate French garrison, losing 693 dead and 316 captured in a failed assault and suspending the siege {{at the end of}} July. Soult's relief attempt was blocked by the Spanish Army of Galicia at San Marcial, allowing the Allies to consolidate their position and <b>tighten</b> the <b>ring</b> around the city, which fell in September after a second spirited defence. Wellington then forced Soult's demoralised and battered army into a fighting retreat into France, punctuated by battles at the Pyrenees, Bidassoa and Nivelle. Wellington invaded southern France, winning at the Nive and Orthez. Wellington's final battle against his rival Soult occurred at Toulouse, where the Allied divisions were badly mauled storming the French redoubts, losing some 4,600 men. Despite this momentary victory, news arrived of Napoleon's defeat and abdication and Soult, seeing no reason to continue the fighting, agreed on a ceasefire with Wellington, allowing Soult to evacuate the city.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA novel {{optimization}} algorithm is presented, inspired by group hunting of {{animals such as}} lions, wolves, and dolphins. Although these hunters have differences {{in the way of}} hunting, they are common in that all of them look for a prey in a group. The hunters encircle the prey and gradually <b>tighten</b> the <b>ring</b> of siege until they catch the prey. In addition, each member of the group corrects its position based on its own position and the position of other members. If the prey escapes from the ring, hunters reorganize the group to siege the prey again. Several benchmark numerical optimization problems, constrained and unconstrained, are presented here to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed Hunting Search (HuS) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed method is a powerful search and optimization technique. It yields better solutions compared to those obtained by some current algorithms when applied to continuous problems...|$|R
50|$|The Georgian coast {{belongs to}} the history of Georgia while the Circassian coast was the {{southern}} flank of the Russo-Circassian War which Velyaminov described as a great siege. Our main concern is with the fortified ports along the coast. From these the Ottomans could support the Circassians with guns and propaganda. Potentially they could have landed troops, but this only happened twice (Abkhazia in 1855 and 1877). The Russians needed to take the forts to <b>tighten</b> the <b>ring</b> around Circassia. The most important were Poti which led to Georgia and Anapa in the north which led to the steppes and the main body of Circassians. Any attack on the ports would be an act of war against the Ottoman Empire. Such a war would be fought mainly in the Balkan region. At war’s end the ports would be used as bargaining chips by diplomats dealing with far more important matters {{on the opposite side of}} the Black Sea.|$|R
40|$|A {{disconnect}} composed basically of {{two halves}} each {{consisting of a}} poppet valve operable to isolate fluid with essentially zero fluid loss is presented. The two halves are coupled together by a quickly releasable coupling which may be either a coupling <b>ring</b> <b>tightened</b> or loosened by a twisting motion, or a clamp operated by a pivoted to prevent disconnecting the two halves until both valves are in closed condition. The positive feature of the device is one requiring a valve closing step before a disconnect step, and takes structural form in an accentric lobe mounted on the valve operating stem. If some obstruction prevents the poppet from moving to its seat, the eccentric lobe cannot be rotated to the closed position, and the interlock prevents a disconnect...|$|R
40|$|Piston {{rings are}} {{installed}} in the piston and cylinder wall, which {{does not have a}} perfect round shape due to machining tolerances or external loads e. g. head bolts <b>tightening.</b> If the <b>ring</b> cannot follow these deformations, a localized lack of contact will occur and consequently an increase in the engine blow-by and lubricant oil consumption. Current 2 D computational methods can not implement such effects – more complex model is necessary. The presented master’s thesis is focused on the developement of a flexible 3 D piston ring model able to capture local deformations. It is based on the Timoshenko beam theory in cooperation with MBS software Adams. Model is then compared with FEM using software ANSYS. The validated piston ring model is assembled into the piston/cylinder liner and very basic simulations are run. Finally, future improvements are suggested...|$|R
5000|$|Government troops, {{using the}} {{recently}} completed rail network from North Baden, were also ready {{to suppress the}} revolution in Freiburg. At Easter, around 1,500 irregular troops barricaded {{in the city and}} waited for relief from 5000 armed revolutionaries led by Franz Sigel. Meanwhile, government and Hessian troops <b>tightened</b> the siege <b>ring</b> around Freiburg. An advance guard of about 300 revolutionaries led by Gustav Struve, who had gathered in Hobern, advanced against Sigel's express command towards Freiburg. Shortly after Günterstal, the small team at the huntsman's well were met with superior government forces. After only a short battle, three soldiers and 20 irregular troops fell, which caused a mass exodus. When the rest of Sigel's irregular troops finally arrived on 24 April, Easter Monday, there were bloody battles with government troops, in which the badly armed rebels were quickly defeated.|$|R
25|$|At 0622, the Marines frantically radioed {{the ship}} they had heavy losses and were withdrawing, Danzig Police {{had tried to}} seize control of the harbor {{on the other side}} of Westerplatte but were defeated. Casualties were 50 Germans and 8 Poles. The Germans tried again at 0855 but met mines, fallen trees, barbed wire and intense fire. By noon the SS men fled and Henningsen was mortally wounded. The initial assault was crushed and a second attack that morning (after an {{artillery}} barrage of 90 280mm shells, 407 150mm shells and 366 88mm shells) was repelled as well, the Germans suffering unexpectedly high losses. The Poles eventually retreated from the Wał and Prom outposts (and for a time also from Fort), <b>tightening</b> the <b>ring</b> of defence around the New Barracks in the centre of the peninsula. On the first day of combat, the Polish side lost one man killed and seven wounded (three died later, including two of them who were captured and died in a German hospital). On the other side, the German naval infantry lost 16 killed in action and some 120 wounded (injuries of various gravity), the majority out of the 225 men deployed. The German losses would have been even greater had not the Polish commander, Major Sucharski, ordered the mortar crews to cease fire in order to conserve ammunition, issued after firing just a few salvos (because of this order only 104 out of their 860 shells were spent when the mortars were destroyed on the next day).|$|R
50|$|The {{cell cycle}} begins with {{interphase}} when the DNA replicates, the cell grows and prepares to enter mitosis. Mitosis includes four phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Prophase is the initial phase when spindle fibers appear that function {{to move the}} chromosomes toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus {{in the middle of}} the cell along the equatorial plate. The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase. Myosin is present in the region of the contractile ring as concentrated microfilaments and actin filaments are predominant in this region. The actin filaments here are both pre-existing and new. Cleavage is driven by these motor proteins, actin and myosin, which are the same proteins involved with muscle contraction. During cellular cleavage, the contractile <b>ring</b> <b>tightens</b> around the cytoplasm of the cell until the cytoplasm is pinched into two daughter cells. During the final phase of mitosis, telophase, the furrow forms an intercellular bridge using mitotic spindle fibers. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) has been shown to be present during this time which indicates that is may play a role in movement between the plasma membrane and contractile ring. The bridge is then broken and resealed to form two identical daughter cells during cytokinesis. The breakage is formed by microtubules and the resealing is negated by Calcium dependent exocytosis using Golgi vesicles. In comparison, the plant cell septum and the animal cell mid-zone are analogous. Both require vesicular secretions by the Golgi apparatus for resealing and formation of the cytoskeletal network in addition to microtubules and microfilaments for division and movement. The cleavage furrow mechanism in animal cells is a complex network of actin and myosin filaments, Golgi vesicles and Calcium dependent channels enabling the cell to break apart, reseal and form new daughter cells with complete membranes.|$|R
