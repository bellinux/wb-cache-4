25|$|After daybreak on {{the morning}} of 26 December, {{servicemen}} returned to a small clearing near {{the eastern edge of the}} forest and found three small impressions in a triangular pattern, as well as burn marks and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 a.m. the local police were called out again, this time to see the impressions on the ground, which they thought could have been made by an animal. Georgina Bruni, in her book You Can't <b>Tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> published a photograph of the supposed landing site taken {{on the morning}} after the first sighting.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{injury is}} a major issue for firefighters as they wear {{insulated}} clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders {{to the status of}} their people on the fire ground. Devices such as PASS device alert 10–20 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices are similar to technology developed for Future Force Warrior and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as {{they may not be able}} to make voice calls over their radio. Current OSHA tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.|$|E

The world's first commercial telegraph line was installed along the [...] from Paddington to West Drayton and came into operation on 9 April 1839. This later spread throughout the system and allowed stations to use telegraphic messages to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> operating the signals when each train arrived safely. A long list of code words were developed to help make messages both quick to send and clear in meaning.|$|E

500|$|The {{continuing}} crisis {{reached a}} {{point of no return}} when the Cortes dissolved the central government in Rio de Janeiro and ordered Pedro's return. This was perceived by Brazilians as an attempt to subordinate their country again to Portugal—Brazil had not been a colony since 1815 and had the status of a kingdom. On 9 January 1822, Pedro was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave. He replied, [...] "Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. <b>Tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that I am staying." [...] Avilez again mutinied and tried to force Pedro's return to Portugal. This time the prince fought back, rallying the Brazilian troops (which had not joined the Portuguese in previous mutinies), militia units and armed civilians. Outnumbered, Avilez surrendered and was expelled from Brazil along with his troops.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{performance}} of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Guèye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying [...] "I have to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> what snow is, what skis are, I have to tell them what big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things." [...] Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Guèye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Guèye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him.|$|E
500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
