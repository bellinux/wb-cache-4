5|$|In conclusion, <b>the</b> <b>insistence</b> of ahimsa {{is not so}} {{much about}} non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self.

5|$|After Austerlitz, Napoleon {{established}} the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection of German states intended {{to serve as}} a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At <b>the</b> <b>insistence</b> of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At <b>the</b> <b>insistence</b> of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half his heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to the status quo in northern Italy.|$|E

He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup too {{difficult for him to}} continue. Many of his films are known for their long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1. Almost always at <b>the</b> <b>insistence</b> of the distributors, Rivette edited shorter versions of five of his films and considered some of them to be entirely new films with different meanings.|$|E
