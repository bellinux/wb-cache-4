5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> end to the lower hoist. In {{the centre of the}} flag, at the convergence of the yellow and red fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to the bottom edge and facing <b>the</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|E
5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of <b>the</b> <b>fly,</b> allowing <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys {{a matter}} {{transporter}} from Professor Frink.

He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by <b>the</b> <b>fly.</b> Lisa then sees {{this as an opportunity}} to undo the process and pushes <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> agaric {{has been}} mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E

5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> to turn sideways. The wings of <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E

5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> heads off in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the animation-related work was done in Hyderabad; the {{remaining}} ten percent was completed in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design <b>the</b> <b>fly.</b> Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he used the 1986 Pixar American short film Luxo Jr. for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face {{to make it look}} appealing onscreen. A new team including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three riggers and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. <b>The</b> <b>fly</b> was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> much more difficult to execute because the latter had to express emotions only though its slender arms rather than its face.|$|E
