5|$|Mug House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak <b>Tree</b> <b>House</b> and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce <b>Tree</b> <b>House</b> is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce <b>Tree</b> <b>House</b> begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.|$|E

He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father does not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture {{into the woods and}} swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned <b>tree</b> <b>house</b> on the other side, and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the <b>tree</b> <b>house</b> getting to know each other.|$|E

Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his <b>tree</b> <b>house,</b> unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the <b>tree</b> <b>house</b> and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce <b>Tree</b> <b>House,</b> Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.|$|E

Suddenly, their window is blown open and the lights go out. Finn and Jake soon discover that Marceline the Vampire Queen has snuck into their house. Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that she really only eats the color red.

The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a <b>tree</b> <b>house</b> and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's <b>tree</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a <b>tree</b> <b>house</b> to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his <b>tree</b> <b>house.</b> Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E

BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and <b>tree</b> <b>house</b> to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E
