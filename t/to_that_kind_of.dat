5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|In the mythical-national Persian history, the Battle of Hatra and the {{incident}} of its fall is accompanied with a romantic story. According to the story, {{at the time}} of the Persian attack on Hatra, the daughter of the city's king had fallen in love with Shapur I, Ardashir's son and had him promise her marriage and then opened the gate of the city; then the Persians captured the city and destroyed it. After Shapur found out about the kindness and attention of the father towards his daughter on the wedding night, the former had her killed due to the daughter's inappreciation <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> father.|$|E

500|$|Moore has {{acknowledged}} the {{narrow range of}} his vocals. He considers his vocal style to [...] " [...] from how I feel when I’m singing, when I'm in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which, a lot of times, comes as the same time. It's sort of an introspective time. A lot of the material lends itself <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> voice {{and that kind of}} spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|Ndegéocello {{spent over}} a year writing the songs from Devil's Halo, being {{inspired}} in part by her trip to Ireland. [...] "I went {{to a couple of}} pubs and there were much older gentlemen playing the guitar and just singing these amazing, simple songs", Ndegéocello recalled. [...] "I really admired that. I wanted to get <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> place where the song could just exist with a guitar and a vocal." [...] With Icelandic audio engineer S. Husky Höskulds, Ndegéocello proceeded to record the album in seven days, backed by a band that featured guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, and drummer Deantoni Parks. She later credited them with providing her inspiration and critique while keeping her [...] "clear about what is the real focus—in life and in music". Their instruments were recorded live without digital post-production, which New York Times critic Ben Ratliff said contributed to the music's raw and organic sound.|$|E
500|$|One {{negative}} {{review was}} written by Margaret McFadden-Gerber in Magill's Literary Annual, who found the book disappointing and felt that it lacked the power and introspection of Angelou's previous books. At least one reviewer expresses disappointment that Angelou did not use her status to effect any political change in Singin' and Swingin'. Critic Lyman B. Hagen responds to this criticism by stating that Angelou's status during the events she describes in this autobiography did not lend itself <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> advocacy, and that as a person, Angelou had not evolved into the advocate that she would become later in her life. Reviewer John McWhorter finds many of the events Angelou describes throughout all of her autobiographies incoherent and confusing, {{and in need of}} further explanation as to her motives and reasons for her behavior. For example, McWhorter suggests that Angelou does a poor job of explaining her reasons for her marriage to Tosh Angelos, as well as their divorce. [...] "In an autobiography in which a black woman marries outside of her race in the 1950s, we need to know more".|$|E

2500|$|In European societies, Roman law, post-classical canon law, {{and later}} common law, {{referred}} to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that [...] "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit [...] "either as male or female, according <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sexe which doth prevaile." [...] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.|$|E
2500|$|On January 31, McCain {{received}} the important endorsement of Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and began campaigning with him; Schwarzenegger had previously refrained from endorsing either McCain or Giuliani because he counted both men as friends. The same day, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, formerly {{a supporter of}} Giuliani, threw his support behind McCain as well. Meanwhile, Romney, still burning about McCain's misleading Iraq withdrawal timetable charge, compared McCain to disgraced former President Richard Nixon, saying that McCain's claim was [...] "reminiscent of the Nixon era" [...] and that [...] "I don't think I want to see our party go back <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> campaigning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guarisco {{felt the}} theme of In Light is {{approaching}} life through appreciation and love. The album was recorded with no particular concept in mind, and the theme [...] "came after the fact," [...] according to Lamson. After recording, the group [...] " [...] had all this time to just sit on what we had done," [...] and they found the songs happened to come out {{as an expression of}} being grateful. [...] "Like I don't care how bad your life is, there's always something around you to be grateful for," [...] said Guarisco in 2011. [...] "Our songs are a testament <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thinking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the medicalization of intersex, Canon {{and common}} law {{referred}} to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. The foundation of common law, the Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit [...] "either as male or female, according <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sexe which doth prevaile." [...] Single cases have been described by legal cases sporadically over the centuries. Modern ideas of medicalization of intersex and birth defects {{can be traced to}} French anatomist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805–1861), who pioneered the field of teratology.|$|E
2500|$|On January 31 McCain {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and began campaigning with him.

2500|$|Elements of {{the album}} dated back {{to the end of}} the songwriting process for the {{previous}} album, Given to the Rising. Scott Kelly explained that the band continued to [...] "overwrite and then start subtracting ...As far back as I can remember, there's always been an initial sort of reflection on where we were with the previous record and what we feel like doing, where we feel like we could be better. [...] We sort of let that settle in and then let the music go as it wishes". [...] Von Till explained that the lengthy songwriting process, which took over 5 years, was important to achieving the end result: [...] "For these songs, we had to kind of let them reconstitute themselves or transform into a new shape over time...It's basically finding the opportunities to surrender ourselves <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tangible spirit that drives everything we do".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There's nothing that can compare <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> first-hand experience." ...|$|E
