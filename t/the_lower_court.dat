5|$|By {{the end of}} the 13th century a large prison {{had been}} built in the castle; this was {{probably}} constructed in the north-west corner of <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Court,</b> overlooked by the Prison Tower. The prisoners kept there in the medieval period included local poachers and, in the 15th century, religious dissidents, including Lollard supporters.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed the conviction of U.S.-born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded {{the case to the}} district court for sentencing as <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the legality of the curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the conviction of Yasui.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his second trial in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from the north end of <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Court,</b> passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
5|$|Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{at that time the}} court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b> Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Court,</b> and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E

5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of securities fraud relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> ruling.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts. The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|In 1476 {{the castle}} passed to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, who {{probably}} began {{the sequence of}} improvements to the castle during the Tudor period. Under the Howards the castle was extensively modernised; fashionable brick was used to improve parts of the castle; ornamental chimneys were added; the battlements were reduced in size to exaggerate the apparent height of the walls, and the Howard coat of arms {{was added to the}} gatehouse. The Great Chamber was probably built across the Inner Court at this time, linking the Great Hall with the chapel and chambers {{on the east side of}} the castle, and by 1524 there were at least 29 different rooms in the castle. The drawbridge outside the gatehouse was replaced with the current permanent bridge between 1524–47; by this time a half-moon defensive structure had been built in stone to defend it. A pleasure garden had been built in <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Court</b> by the 16th century, with several ornamental ponds and terraced walkways – the garden would probably have also had fruit trees, herb gardens and fountains. Another pleasure garden was built in the Bailey, and a second bridge built across the moat to allow access to it directly from the Inner Court. The Prison Tower was redesigned to become a viewing gallery for the new formal gardens below.|$|E
