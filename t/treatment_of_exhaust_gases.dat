Pure ceria is used in several organic reactions, such as the dehydration of alcohols, the alkylation of aromatic compounds, ketone formation, and aldolization, and in redox reactions. Ceria-supported metal catalysts allow the hydrogenation of many unsaturated compounds. They can also be used for coupling or ring-opening reactions. Cerium atoms can be added as dopants to catalytic system or impregnated onto zeolites and mesoporous catalyst materials to improve their performances.

This paper investigates the effects <b>of</b> <b>Exhaust</b> Gas Recirculation {{on the performance of}} a diesel engine in terms of fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, as well as HC, CO, and NOx emissions. For this aim, a naturally aspirated four-stroke direct injection diesel engine was tested with diesel fuel, at different loading conditions from no load to full load condition at the constant speed 1500 rpm and at different EGR Rates from 10 % to 40 %. The evaluation of experimental data showed that NOx emission was reduced by about 80 % because of EGR. However, it was observed that emissions of CO & HC were higher than those in the operations with diesel fuel, without EGR. A slight decrease in brake thermal efficiency was also noticed because of EGR.

40|$|Xanthomonas sp. strain DY 44, {{capable of}} {{degrading}} H 2 S, was isolated from dimethyl disulfide-acclimated peat. This bacterium removed H 2 S {{either as a}} single gas or {{in the presence of}} the sulfur-containing compounds methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. The maximum specific H 2 S removal rate, obtained in the late stationary phase, was 3. 92 mmol g of dry cells- 1 h- 1 (6. 7 x 10 (- 16) mol cell- 1 h- 1) at pH 7 and 30 degrees C through a batch experiment in a basal mineral medium. Since Xanthomonas sp. strain DY 44 exhibited no autotrophic growth with H 2 S, the H 2 S removal was judged not to be a consequence of chemolithotrophic activity. By using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the metabolic product of H 2 S oxidation was determined to be polysulfide, which has properties very similar to those of elemental sulfur. Autoclaved cells (120 degrees C, 20 min) did not show H 2 S degradation, but cells killed by gamma-irradiation and cell extracts both oxidized H 2 S, suggesting the existence of a heat-labile intracellular enzymatic system for H 2 S oxidation. When Xanthomonas sp. strain DY 44 was inoculated into fibrous peat, this strain degraded H 2 S without lag time, suggesting that it will be a good candidate for maintaining high H 2 S removability in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases...</b>|$|E

An advantage in use of alternative fuels with IC engines for motor vehicle propulsion has fuels which do not require greater modifications of the IC engines. In this scope, bio fuels and LPG are the best fuels, especially LPG where good supply infrastructure exists. Use of petrol and LPG fuels operated IC engines, simultaneously, represents the best solution for powering of the motor vehicles. Besides ecological aspects, the most important parameter for additional setting of LPG installation is economical, due to price of this fuel which is significantly lower when compared to petrol. Although manufacturers of LPG systems offer a swift change of petrol to LPG use on IC engines and viceversa, a question on how LPG system influences the basic IC engine characteristics could be asked. Results of research related with the basic IC engine characteristics in case of petrol and LPG use, for pointed vehicle, are presented in the paper. In order to determin mentioned engine characteristics, the measurements of vehicle dynamics characteristics was carried out and afterwords the determination of the IC engine characteristics was done by calculation.

40|$|Summary. The article {{executed}} {{the feasibility}} study of various options for gas treatment. Rapid development {{of industry and}} transport worldwide in recent times raises {{the problem in the}} protection of habitat environment from harmful waste. In solving problems of flue gas treatment great attention is given to the economic characteristics and recycling techniques for capturing emissions and disposal must also meet the sanitary health requirements: flue gas treatment plants should not cause air or water pollution. The set objective is solved by developing a two-stage wet treatment system for pyrolysis gas based on ejector scrubbers. Their advantage - a central nozzle supply that allows the scrubber to operate on the principle of an ejector pump. Projected plant can be used in enterprises for processing of solid domestic and industrial waste, where there are steam and hot water boilers, whose operations result in contaminated gases emissions obtained with high temperatures. In particular, this installation can be applied at a cement plant in which a large amount of waste gases containing sulfur oxides is emitted. Assessment of market potential for the plant designed to treat waste gases in the cement factory is performed through a SWOT analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe NOx storage {{reduction}} (NSR) {{process is}} commonly envisaged for the NOx <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from lean-burn engine vehicles. NOx are firstly stored on the catalyst, which is periodically {{submitted to a}} reducing mixture for few seconds {{in order to reduce}} the stored NOx into N- 2. The on-board reducer is coming from the gasoline/diesel fuel and, in fact, the NSR catalyst is submitted to a mixture of hydrocarbons, CO and H- 2 with various compositions depending on the lean/rich step. In this study, the influence of each reducer (C 3 H 6, CO and H- 2) is evaluated separately, with a special consideration to the N 2 O selectivity. It is demonstrated that the N 2 O can be emitted during both lean and rich periods, with varying ratio depending on the considered reducer and the temperature of gas. For instance, at 300 degrees C, a high N 2 O selectivity is observed when C 3 H 6 is used, and near half of the N 2 O emission occurs during the storage phase in lean condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} release of the Kyoto {{protocol}} the demand for CO 2 -free processes have been increasing. In this paper three different concepts with no or a very small release of CO 2 to the atmosphere are evaluated and compared concerning plant efficiency and investment cost. A novel approach to biomass gasification is proposed to provide fuel for a combined gas turbine cycle, where the biomass {{is considered to be a}} renewable fuel with zero impact regarding CO 2 in the exhaust gases. The gasification concept used is a Dual Pressurised Fluidised Bed Gasifier (DPFBG) system, using steam and recycled product gas as fluidising agent in the gasification reactor. In the separate combustion reactor air is used as fluidising agent. The second cycle is a hybrid fuelled Humid Air Turbine (HAT) cycle with post-combustion CO 2 -separation. Steam used for regenerating the amines in the separation plant is produced using a biomass boiler, and natural gas is used as fuel for the humid air turbine. With this fuel mix the net release of CO 2 can even be less than zero if the exhaust gas from the steam generator is mixed and cleaned together with the main exhaust gas flow. The third cycle proposed is a combined cycle with postcombustion CO 2 -separation and the steam generation for the CO 2 -separation integrated in the bottoming steam cycle. All power cycles have been modelled in IPSEpro [trademark] (tm), a heat and mass balance software, using advanced component models developed by the authors. An equilibrium model is employed both for the gasification and the separation of CO 2 from exhaust gases. All three power cycles show efficiencies around 45 %, which is high for a biomass gasification cycle. The HAT and the combined cycle show efficiency drops of about 8 percentage points, due to the post-combustion <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{discussions of}} {{heterogeneous}} catalysis and other surface-related phenomena, the dynamical {{properties of the}} catalytic material are often neglected, even at elevated temperatures. An example is the three-way catalyst (TWC), used for <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from combustion engines operating at several hundred degrees Celsius. In the TWC, reduced ceria (CeO 2 -x) {{is one of the}} key components, where it functions as an oxygen buffer, storing and releasing oxygen to provide optimal conditions for the catalytic conversion of the pollutants. In this process it is evident that dynamics plays a crucial role, not only ionic vibrations, but also oxygen diffusion. In this thesis, the structure and dynamics of several ionic crystalline compounds and their surfaces have been studied by means of Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Lattice dynamics (LD) calculations. The main focus lies on CeO 2 -x, but also CeO 2, MgO and CaF 2 have been investigated. The presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria is found to lead to significant distortions of the oxygen framework around the defect (but not of the cerium framework). As a consequence, a new O-O distance emerges, as well as a significantly broadened Ce-O distance distribution. The presence of oxygen vacancies in ceria also leads to increased dynamics. The oxygen self-diffusion in reduced ceria was calculated from MD simulations in the temperature range 800 - 2000 K, and was found to follow an Arrhenius behaviour with a vacancy mechanism along the crystallographic directions only. The cation and anion vibrational surface dynamics were investigated for MgO (001) using DFT-LD and for CaF 2 (111) in a combined LEED and MD study. Specific surface modes were found for MgO and increased surface dynamics was found both experimentally and theoretically for CaF 2, which is isostructural with CeO 2. Many methodological aspects of modeling dynamics in ionic solids are also covered in this thesis. In many cases, the representation of the model system (slab thickness, simulation box-size and the choice of ensemble) was found to have a significant influence on the results...|$|E

A major challenge is to develop appropriate catalytic technology for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from the engine, to meet the new European Waste Incineration Directive (WID) for this type of a process. So called structured reactors based on metallic short channel structures with enhanced mass and heat transport [], are able to considerably shorten the reactor length and combat issues experienced with current DeNOx technology, namely ammonia-selective catalytic reduction (SCR), including the size of the cleaning installation and ammonia slip. In line with the requirements stated by the structured reactors and the NH 3 -SCR process are copper-exchanged zeolites, which are known for their remarkable activity in the reduction of nitrogen oxides [] (Figure 1). Use of the steamed form of zeolite Y as a matrix for the copper cations should lead to the active catalyst having both Cu+ and H+ cations acting as active centres in the DeNOx process. Additionally, the steaming process should form mesopores facilitating reagents transport, and should stabilize existing acidic centres, protecting them from further decomposition under the harsh conditions of the catalytic reaction. The catalyst was examined by XRD and the types of active centres present within the zeolite structure were checked by in situ FTIR adsorption and desorption measurements using pyridine, NO and CO as probe molecules. The surface of the deposited catalysts was analysed with the standard SEM/EDX method, to verify the distribution of the material, and the coupled system of AFM and confocal Raman microscope to investigate the structure and dispersion of the material. The catalysts were tested in the reduction of NO and NO 2 with ammonia in a gradientless reactor to derive kinetic parameters.

The existing commercial catalysts succeed, in a satisfactory degree, the NO reduction in exhaust gases operated in the stoichiomentric air/fuel ratio. A technological target for such systems {{is to be able to}} operate at temperatures as low as 200 oC (in order to reduce emissions during cold engine start-up) and in high excess of oxygen. It has been well documented during recent decade that the catalytic activity and selectivity of porous metal films interfaced with solid electrolytes can be affected in a very pronounced and controlled manner upon polarization of the catalyst-electrode. This phenomenon is known in the literature as Electrochemical Promotion (E. P.) or Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA effect) and it has been studied for more than 70 different catalytic systems. In the first part of this thesis, the electrochemical promotion of the NO reduction by propylene in presence of oxygen was investigated on porous polycrystalline Rh catalyst-electrodes deposited on YSZ (Y 2 O 3 – stabilized ZrO 2) an O 2 - conductor. The experiments were carried out in galvanic cells of the type: NO C 3 H 6, O 2 products Rh YSZ Au products NO C 3 H 6, O 2 The experimental conditions were close to those in the exhaust of a lean burn or diesel engine, i. e., high gas-hourly-space-velocity (GHSV), considerable open circuit catalytic performance and in some cases considerable excess of oxygen. It was found that both the oxygen and hydrocarbon partial pressures affect the catalytic rates and the extend of the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion. Rate enhancement ratios of 200 and faradaic efficiencies of 7000 were observed for the case of CO 2 production while those for N 2 production were 55 and 550, respectively. The reaction exhibits inverted volcano type behaviour, that means a rate enhancement observation under both anodic and cathodic polarization. In the second part, the oxidation of two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Ethylene and Toluene, was investigated on polycrystalline RuO 2 films deposited on the same electrolyte of YSZ. The rates of ethylene and tolouene oxidation were enhanced by a factor of 20 and 8 respectively under anodic polarization. Cathodic polarization enhances the catalytic rates by a factor of 3 and 4 respectively. No partial pressure products were observed.

40|$|The {{context of}} the study is {{connected}} with the renewable sources of energy from biomass gasification (e. g. forestry residue, farming residue, municipal waste), to obtain biogas (H 2, CO, CO 2, N 2, HCs) in gas engines. Gas engines (turbines) producing electricity or hot water provide energy at a local level. A major challenge is to develop appropriate catalytic technology for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> (from the engine), to meet the new European Waste Incineration Directive (WID) for this type of a process. The problem of the exhaust gases installation lies in their immense size, ammonia slip, thermal deactivation (hot spots) and catalyst based on nobel metals. The remedy can be the application of the so called structured reactors based on metallic short channel structures of enhanced mass and heat transport [1] that are able to considerably shorten the reactor length. The application of such structures is entirely dependent on the development of new, highly-active catalysts with an increased conversion adjusted to high transport properties and also the methods of catalyst layering on the metallic surface. In line with the requirements stated by the structured reactors and the NH 3 -SCR process seem the copper-exchanged zeolites, which are known for their remarkable activity both in in the nitrogen oxides reduction and also in direct NO decomposition [3, 4]. This work focuses on the optimization of the Catlab system equipped with tubular reactor and QMS for kinetic studies of NOx selective reduction with ammonia in the presence of oxygen. The equipment enables the multistep TPSR reactions including reduction, oxidation and desorption which used in a sequence provide the information on the active centres for the process. In this study. A real challenge is a proper calibration of the QMS detector for this kind of purposes. For this study the Cu 2 +-Y zeolite was prepared by exchanging the steamed form of NH 4 +-Y zeolite (LZY- 82, Linde of Si/Alfram = 4. 5) by three-fold ion exchange from aqueous solution of Cu(NO 3) 2 at 85 oC. The sheets of kanthal steal were used as the catalyst carriers. As a reference the ZSM- 5 zeolite was also tested. The catalyst was deposited {{on the surface of the}} precalcined (1000 oC) and washcoated (Al 2 O 3 or TiO 2) surface of the carriers by impregnation. Both forms of the zeolite catalyst: powder and deposited one were subjected to further analyses.

40|$|Ceria is an {{important}} component in three-way catalysts for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> automobile <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> owing to its ability to store and release oxygen, a property known as the oxygen storage capacity. Much effort has been focused on increasing the OSC of ceria, and one avenue of exploration is the ability to fabricate CeO 2 -based catalysts, which expose reactive surfaces. Here we show how models for a polycrystalline CeO 2 thin film, which expose the (111), (110), and dipolar (100) surfaces, can be synthesized. This is achieved by supporting the CeO 2 thin film on an yttrium-stabilized zirconia substrate using a simulated amorphization and recrystallization strategy. In particular, the methodology generates models which reveal the atomistic structures present {{on the surface of the}} reactive faces and provides details of the grain-boundary structures, defects (vacancies, substitutionals, and clustering), and epitaxial relationships. Such models are {{an important}} first step in understanding the active sites at the surface of a catalytic material...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS: Air-pollution {{management}} {{is a major}} issue in all new road tunnel projects, particularly in urban areas. Pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere by means <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> stacks is the most common solution. A viable alternative, or complement, is based on proper <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> The present paper is devoted to the state-of-the-art of exhaust-treatment technologies. The available technologies were evaluated from a technical, economical and environmental point of view. The main findings and conclusion from our investigation were as follows: − Filtration by means of electrostatic precipitators allow for an effective extraction of particles from the tunnel exhaust. This technology is mature and sufficiently well proven for road tunnel applications. − The <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> gaseous pollutants constitutes a much less proven technology. Tunnel experience is not sufficiently extensive and some important issues, related to exploitation costs, durability and efficiency are not yet entirely solved. For the particular case of the tunnel Lugano the evaluation of costs and benefits led to the conclusion that filtration is not required, since pollutant dispersion through the ventilation stack is very effective under all circumstances. 1...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 25 Mt/year of sludge {{and dust}} are {{obtained}} from the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> produced during the manufacturing of cast iron and steel from blast furnace, converter and continuous casting machines. This waste contains {{a large amount of}} valuable elements that could be recycled in the steelmaking process itself. Unfortunately, sludge and dust are difficult to recycle and so most of them are disposed in landfills. In this work, a feasibility study on the use of blast furnace sludge as a reducing agent to produce direct reduced iron from BOF-dust is presented. Self-reducing briquettes containing a mixture of BOF-dust, BOF-sludge and BF-sludge were produced. Thermo-gravimetric and roasting tests were performed in non-isotherm conditions from room temperature to 1170 °C in both argon and air atmospheres. The XRD and SEM analysis performed highlighted the metallization ratio of about 50 - 60 % for air reduced briquette and 60 - 80 % for argon reduced briquette. These results foster the technical feasibility of the use of BF sludge as a reducing agent to produce direct reduced iron (DRI). The use of BF-sludge as C-source for BOF dusts reduction lead to a cost saving estimated to 1500 M€/year worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Cordierite {{is often}} used as {{substrate}} for three way catalysts for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> automobile <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> mainly because <b>of</b> its high stability. In this paper, different synthesis methods of cordierite are systematically investigated with the aim to improve functionalities and surface properties. Amongst them, the conventional sintering method from kaolin was paid attention to, due to economic reasons and the high yield of obtained cordierite phase. With the aim to improve the porosity, burnable additives {{were added to the}} precursor powder and acid leaching was applied to treat the surface of the substrates. The latter was found to be the most efficient method, especially when dolomite and industrial aluminum hydroxide were added in the precursors. Surface area of the cordierite sample reaches 139 m(2) /g with acceptable mechanical strength. The increase of the cordierite surface area resulted in a higher loading of MnO 2 -Co 3 O 4 -NiO catalytic active phases, leading to higher activity for the complete oxidation of CO. The deposition of an additional -Al 2 O 3 support layer, which is normally done for these kinds of applications, becomes superfluous...|$|R
40|$|Cerium oxide based {{nanocomposite}} systems play {{an important}} role in oxidation reactions and could be used as advanced anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Cerium oxide is a major component in the three-way catalysts (TWC) used for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> automotive <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> [1]. The oxygen storage capacity associated with a fast Ce(IV) /Ce(III) redox process, is one of the key properties of this material [2]. Appropriate preparation procedures allow one to deposit nano-sized oxide particles on an active metal support, thus taking advantage of the reactivity of deposited nanoclusters and also the active metal support [3]. The mixed W–Ce–O nanocomposites in different compositions with varying atomic percentages of different elements, were prepared by wet impregnation of CeO 2 powder with an aqueous solution containing increasing quantity of (NH 4) 6 (W 12 O 39) ·H 2 O and calcined at 500 oC in air. The significant differences in the activity of WO 3 and CeO 2 make the investigations on WO 3 supported on CeO 2 interesting and vital insights could be obtained by studying the influence of the supported oxide (WO 3) on the surface reactivity of the support (CeO 2). In one of our earlier works on Fe 2 O 3 supported on mixed La–Sr–Co–Fe–O oxide, the investigations revealed the diffusion of Fe 2 O 3 into the support leading to the formation of different oxide-based compounds [4]. Therefore, it i...|$|R
40|$|Monolithic (honeycomb) {{catalysts}} are continuous unitary structures containing many narrow, parallel {{and usually}} straight channels (or passages). Catalytically active components are dispersed uniformly {{over the whole}} porous ceramic monolith structure (so-called incorporated monolithic catalysts) or are in a layer of porous material that is deposited {{on the walls of}} channels in the monolith's structure (washcoated monolithic catalysts). The material of the main monolithic construction is not limited to ceramics but includes metals, as well. Monolithic catalysts are commonly used in gas phase catalytic processes, such as <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> automotive <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, catalytic removal of volatile organic compounds from industrial processes, etc. Monoliths continue to be the preferred support for environmental applications due to their high geometric surface area, different design options, low pressure drop, high temperature durability, mechanical strength, ease of orientation in a reactor and effectiveness as a support for a catalytic washcoat. As known, monolithic catalysts belong to the class of the structured catalysts and/or reactors (in some cases the distinction between "catalyst" and "reactor" has vanished). Structured catalysts can greatly intensify chemical processes, resulting in smaller, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient technologies. Monolith reactors can be considered as multifunctional reactors, in which chemical conversion is advantageously integrated with another unit operation, such as separation, heat exchange, a secondary reaction, etc. Finally, structured catalysts and/or reactors appear {{to be one of the}} most significant and promising developments in the field of heterogeneous catalysis and chemical engineering of the recent years. This paper gives a description of the background and perspectives for application and development of monolithic materials. Different methods and techniques used in the preparation of monolithic catalysts are described. Several commercial applications of monolithic catalysts are presented. New applications and the associated technical challenges for the monolithic catalyst and reactors are discussed as well...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of extremely {{high levels of}} engine efficiency combined {{with the use of}} cheap, low-quality fuels has resulted in significantly increased emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and particulate matter. Consequently the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and various national and local administrations have reacted by establishing policies to prevent and control air pollution from ships leading to a challenging task in understanding all legal and administrative requests. In the Revision of MARPOL Annex VI dated 2008 the International Maritime Organisation agreed to further tighten the limits on the emissions of nitrogen oxides. In the second stage (Tier II) a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by about 20 % compared to the previous values is required. The third stage of emission limits for nitrogen oxides (Tier III) shall apply to new buildings with keel laying from 1 January 2016 when navigating Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In particular, this third stage imposes a strong challenge for engine manufacturers, ship operators and certifiers (Recognised Organisations / classification societies) from a technical and operational point of view. As without specific <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> the third level of emission limits for nitrogen oxides is unlikely to be met. For this reason the International Maritime Organization recently published guidelines for the use of after-treatment systems. The correct executions of the guidelines have to be proven and guaranteed {{from the perspective of a}} classification society. Moreover the installation and operation of such systems must be both: in compliance with these guidelines and in conformity with a safe ship operation. To this end, Germanischer Lloyd has extended its rules to a section on <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> aftertreatment systems. In this work latest updates and future emission standards for marine applications are introduced. The purpose of this work is to show technical solutions for <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> aftertreatment systems from the perspective of a classification society with a strong focus on its technical, operational, organizational and administrative challenges...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} {{to comply with}} the standards given by the ordinance on biological waste treatment facilities (30. BImSchV). A main focus thereby was done on the environmental impact of the waste gas cleaning system called non catalytic (regenerative) thermal oxidation (RTO). As a result of the new environmental standards the conception of mechanical biological (pre-) treatment plants (MBT/P) had to change. In particular the low standards for organic carbons in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>of</b> MBT necessitate a thermal <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> this gas at least for heavily loaded gas streams. As the knowledge about emissions of RTO plant used for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> MBT <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> was very limited, extensive measurements were made within this research work. Beside the emission standards for several pollutants the ordinance on biological waste treatment facilities gives weight specific standards (loads) for organic carbons and nitrous oxide. These loads involve the waste input quantities and the <b>exhaust</b> air volumes <b>of</b> MBT plants into the emission calculation. An emission source analysis with a special focus on the organic carbon emissions from plant components of a modern MBT plants was made at the MBT in Borken (North Rhine-Westphalia). The found emission progression in both the discharge area and the area <b>of</b> mechanical waste <b>treatment</b> gave reason to the conclusion that a cleaning of gas from these areas via biofilters as publicised by several companies will not work properly. So these gas amounts have to be used in subsequent areas of MBT such as the biological waste treatment. In the area <b>of</b> biological waste <b>treatment</b> an additional and extensive reduction of the total amount <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from MBT plants can be achieved by a more effective usage of oxygen in the air and by a more effective energy removal. To what extent both factors can be varied without interfering the rotting process was examined by laboratory and pilot plant studies. The results are pointing to the potential <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> reduction at MBT plants considering previous control factors and help keeping the standards. The multiple-shift usage <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from several plant components of MBT and the thereby caused increase of organic carbon concentrations affects an economical and associated with this an additional ecological benefit. The RTO technology needs energy to maintain the oxidation process. This energy can be supplied by external energy sources or by the energy content of the pollutants in the waste gas. Chapter 5 gives theoretical calculations that show that an autothermic operation could be reached when the organic carbon concentrations exceed 500 to 1. 000 mg/m" 3 depending on the energy content adopted to carbons in the crude gas. Finally, the collected results are brought together against the background of MBT technology and chances as well as risks that arise from the experimental results appreciated. (orig.)

40|$|Solar Tower Technology is a {{promising}} way to generate sustainable electricity from concentrated solar radiation. In {{one of the}} most effective variants of this technology, a so called volumetric air receiver is used to convert concentrated radiation into heat. This component consists of a high temperature resistant cellular material which absorbs radiation and transfers the heat to an air flow which is fed from the ambient and from recirculated air. It is called volumetric, because the radiation may penetrate into the “volume” of the receiver through the open, permeable cells of the material. In this way a larger amount of heat transfer surface supports the solid to gaseous heat transfer in comparison to a tubular closed receiver. Finally the heated air is directed to the steam generator of a conventional steam turbine system. In this study an advanced cellular metal honeycomb structure has been designed, manufactured and tested for use as an open volumetric receiver. It consists of winded pairs of flat and corrugated metal foils. The technology is based on a one which has been primarily developed for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> combustion engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> A number <b>of</b> variations of the pure linear honeycomb structure have been introduced to increase local turbulence and radial flow. Firstly, a set of samples has been tested in laboratory scale experiments to determine effective properties and the solar-to-thermal efficiency. After that, results have been compared with theoretical predictions. Finally, the three most promising materials have been used for a 500 kW test on the research platform of the Solar Tower Jülich. Air outlet temperatures of more than 800 °C have been achieved with efficiencies of about 80...|$|R
