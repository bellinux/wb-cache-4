5|$|This {{meant that}} his pyramid {{was out of}} the {{alignment}} formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This would explain why, despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father and closer in size to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grandfather Sahure.|$|E
5|$|A male Earth-human {{who starts}} {{as a junior}} intern and, {{over the course of}} the series, works his way up to Chief Surgeon and {{eventually}} Diagnostician in Charge of Surgery. Conway (whose first name, Peter, is only revealed in the ninth book) generally prefers extraterrestrial company to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own species, and has a habit of thinking aloud. His passions are healing and Murchison.|$|E

5|$|According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was {{approached}} by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> labelmates.|$|E
5|$|Ahmose I's {{campaigns in}} Nubia are better documented. Soon {{after the first}} Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed. After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian {{gathered}} many rebels in Nubia, but he too was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at Buhen. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported his cause and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dynastic predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parties of}} the College of Cardinals were of almost an equal size. The party of Aymeric had 19 members, while <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponents 24, but {{the party of the}} Chancellor was {{certainly}} better organized.|$|E

5|$|By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct {{connection}} with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's {{through a series of}} trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|Even though Maryland did not {{secede from}} the Union, Steuart's loyalty lay with the South, as did <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father.

5000|$|Bellamy did, however, {{draw on the}} {{community}} for inspiration in his writings. The last name of Julian West, the protagonist of Looking Backward, is <b>that</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neighbors. Elements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> historical novel The Duke of Stockbridge, based on {{the events of the}} 1786-87 Shays' Rebellion, are set in a town resembling Chicopee, and characters in his short story [...] "A Nantucket Idyll" [...] are based on local women. Biographer Arthur Morgan notes <b>that</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> other stories are set in towns based [...] "quite obviously on the village of Chicopee Falls".|$|R
5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship {{is suggested by the}} fact that his funerary cult was associated with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{succession}} of strokes, Nash died in the Repatriation Hospital in Heidelberg, Victoria on 24 July 1986, aged 76.

5|$|His {{account is}} more sensationalist and anecdotal than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporary.

After a few brief skirmishes, the allies decided to abandon the siege and they pitched in Tegea. They then advanced upon Caryae where {{they were joined by}} 1,500 Macedonians and 400 Thessalian cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In Marion, {{the body}} of Warren Harding was placed on a horse-drawn hearse, which was {{followed}} by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft, then by Harding's wife and father. They followed it through the city, past the Star building where the presses stood silent, and at last to the Marion Cemetery, where the casket {{was placed in the}} cemetery's receiving vault. Harding's body, along with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife who died in 1924, rests today in the Harding Tomb, which was dedicated in 1931 by President Hoover.|$|E

5|$|Many {{accounts}} {{claim that}} Cascioferro personally killed Petrosino.

He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascioferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again.
