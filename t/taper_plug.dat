40|$|Abstract. The {{existing}} {{processing methods}} of machining parts {{with an array}} of micro-cylinders (The small mold punch and spinneret micro-porous electrode) is circumferential milling which has the following three major problems (1) longer cutting tool path, (2) difficulty of accuracy guarantee, (3) complex processing. For this reason, this paper proposes a new way of processing- plunging, it has high efficiency, simple process, small cutting force, etc. For plunge milling process, the wings <b>tapered</b> <b>plug</b> cutter is designed...|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a hole, usually round or oval, and a <b>tapered</b> <b>plug,</b> usually a disk shape {{on the end of}} a shaft also called a valve stem. The portion of the hole where the plug meets with it is referred to as the 'seat' or 'valve seat'. The shaft guides the plug portion by sliding through a valve guide. In exhaust applications a pressure differential helps to seal the valve and in intake valves a pressure differential helps open it. Poppet valves date from at least the 1770s, when James Watt used them on his steam engines.|$|R
50|$|The Ferguson rifle used a <b>tapered</b> screw <b>plug</b> {{inserted}} {{perpendicular to}} the axis of the barrel. It was charged with ball and powder and required only one rotation to permit loading. While novel and effective, cost was a factor for its limited acceptance.|$|R
40|$|Some {{preliminary}} {{brush seal}} leakage results for ambient temperature air are presented. Data for four nominal brush rotor radial clearances of - 0. 09, - 0. 048, - 0. 008, and 0. 035 mm {{were taken by}} using a <b>tapered</b> <b>plug</b> rotor at 0 and 400 rpm with rotor runout of 0. 127 mm peak to peak. The brush seal nominal bore diameter was 38 mm with 0. 05 mm bristles at 200 bristles/mm of circumference and a 0. 61 mm fence height. Leakages were greater than predicted, but agreement was reasonable. Leakage rates were not significantly altered by hysteresis or inlet flow variations. Visualization studies showed that the bristles followed the 400 rpm excitation, and loading studies indicated that bristles slid relative to one another...|$|R
50|$|In {{friction}} <b>plug</b> welding a <b>tapered</b> shaped <b>plug</b> is {{friction welded}} into a tapered {{hole in the}} substrate. This welding method {{can be used to}} repair defects in castings. It has also been used to fill the holes that occur on completion of a friction stir welding pass when the stirring probe is withdrawn from the weld.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the activities initiated {{to improve the}} existing spray gun system used for spraying insulating foam on the External Tank of the Space Shuttle, due to the quality variations of the applied foam noted in the past. Consideration {{is given to the}} two tasks of the project: (1) investigations of possible improvements, as an interim measure, to the spray gun currently used to apply the large acreage spray-on-foam insulation and the evaluation of other commercial equipment; and (2) the design and fabrication of a new automatic spray gun. The design and operation of the currently used Binks 43 PA spray gun are described together with several new breadboard spray guns designed and fabricated and the testing procedures developed. These new guns include the Modular Automatic Foam spray gun, the Ball Valve spray gun, and the <b>Tapered</b> <b>Plug</b> Valve (TPV) gun. As a result of tests, the TPV spray gun is recommended to replace the currently used automatic spray gun...|$|R
5000|$|Stopcocks used in {{laboratory}} glassware are typically forms of conically <b>tapered</b> <b>plug</b> valves. When fused with the glassware, the valve bodies {{are made of}} glass. Otherwise, they can be made of an inert plastic such as Teflon. The plugs can be made of a similar plastic or glass. When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When glass is used for both the stopcock body and the plug, the contacting surfaces between them are special ground glass surfaces (see Laboratory glassware) often with stopcock grease in between. Special glass stopcocks are made for vacuum applications, such as in use with vacuum manifolds. Stopcock grease is always used in high vacuum applications to make the stopcock air-tight. Also if the plug valve is [...] "locked" [...] from being in the open or closed position for an extended amount of time lubricant can be added through the greaser with the valve in service.|$|R
5000|$|The Xpandrel {{method of}} {{expanding}} mandrels {{was introduced in}} the mid-1990s. This method uses basic mechanical principles of deformation to achieve expansion of a non-tapered mandrel. Using various methods of actuation, the body of the mandrel is deformed below the limit of elasticity to provide repeatable holding forces without typical deformation caused by pressing on tapered mandrels. Other commercial mandrels are very slightly tapered, and the hollow object slides down the taper until it [...] "sticks". The shop-made mandrel shown in the photo is designed to clamp a hollow tube or gear between the two <b>tapered</b> <b>plugs.</b> There is little about such a mandrel that can't be made right on the lathe on which it is to be used, so {{it is not uncommon for}} machinists to make a mandrel to hold a particular item and then set the mandrel aside hoping to use it again some day. Mandrels of this type are usually set in the lathe on centers and turned with a lathe dog.|$|R
40|$|Control of {{the exit}} {{temperature}} of the coolant from each fuel channel of the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility reactor is obtained by adjusting the coolant flow rate by a remotely operated variable orifice. Two variable orifices were designed and the hydraulic characteristics determined. Both orifice designs utilized a <b>tapered</b> <b>plug</b> {{moving in and out}} of a restricted flow passage at the upper end of the fuel channel. Data were obtained on pressure drop as a function of flow rate at different orifice plug positions; all measurements were made using water, and data were converted to equivalent values for sodium. Either type of orifice was capable of adjusting flow rate to match the power output of a fuel element at any location in the reactor core. The temperature sensitivity (change in exit temperature per unit change in orifice plug position) of the first type of orifice was low (lO deg F/in.) when used in combination with a central fuel element, and high (7 OO deg F/in.) when used with a peripheral element. The temperature sensitivity of the second type was more uniform (varying from 90 to 250 deg F/ in.). Consequently, the second type of orifice was selected for the HNPF. (auth...|$|R
2500|$|After the inventions of the {{combination}} lock, James Sargent—an employee of Yale—developed the [...] "theft proof lock." [...] This {{was a combination}} lock that worked on a timer. The vault or safe door could only be opened after a set number of hours had passed, thus a kidnapped bank employee could not open the lock {{in the middle of}} the night even under force. Time locks became widespread at banks in the 1870s. This reduced the kidnappings, but set bank robbers to work again at prying or blasting open vaults. Thieves developed tools for forcing open a tiny crack between the vault door and frame. As the crack widened, the thieves levered the door open or poured in gunpowder and blasted it off. Vault makers responded with a series of stair-stepped grooves in the door frame so the door could not be levered open. But these grooves proved ideal for a new weapon: liquid nitroglycerin. Professional bank robbers learned to boil dynamite in a kettle of water and skim the nitroglycerin off the top. They could drip this volatile liquid into the door grooves and destroy the door. Vault makers subsequently redesigned their doors so they closed with a thick, smooth, <b>tapered</b> <b>plug.</b> The plug fit so tightly that there was no room for the nitroglycerin.|$|R
50|$|A disc or {{valve member}} is a movable {{obstruction}} inside the stationary body that adjustably restricts {{flow through the}} valve. Although traditionally disc-shaped, discs come in various shapes. Depending {{on the type of}} valve, a disc can move linearly inside a valve, or rotate on the stem (as in a butterfly valve), or rotate on a hinge or trunnion (as in a check valve). A ball is a round valve member with one or more paths between ports passing through it. By rotating the ball, flow can be directed between different ports. Ball valves use spherical rotors with a cylindrical hole drilled as a fluid passage. Plug valves use cylindrical or conically <b>tapered</b> rotors called <b>plugs.</b> Other round shapes for rotors are possible as well in rotor valves, as long as the rotor can be turned inside the valve body. However, not all round or spherical discs are rotors; for example, a ball check valve uses the ball to block reverse flow, but is not a rotor because operating the valve does not involve rotation of the ball.|$|R
