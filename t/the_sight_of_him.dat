25|$|Despite being a goalkeeper, {{he would}} run into the attack on corner kicks if his team was behind. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> going up for the corner was a great {{distraction}} to opposing defenders. He scored a goal in this fashion, for Man United, in a UEFA Cup match against Rotor Volgograd at Old Trafford in September 1995. He scored in the last minutes of the game to tie the match 2–2, though United were eliminated from the tournament on the away goals rule.|$|E
500|$|The police {{investigate}} {{a string of}} murders committed by the Creeper (Rondo Hatton), a mysterious killer with a hideously disfigured face. The Creeper attacks and murders Professor Cushman (John Hamilton), a professor from the nearby Hampton University. Later that night, the killer approaches a woman named Joan Bemis (Janelle Johnson) {{in front of her}} home and identifies himself as Hal Moffet. Joan screams hysterically at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> until he is driven to kill her. When police cars approach, the Creeper climbs the fire escape of a city tenement building to escape and enters the apartment of Helen Paige (Jane Adams), a blind pianist. Unable to see the Creeper's deformed face, Helen is not afraid of the intruder, even when he admits to fleeing. [...] When police officers knock on her door, failing to identify themselves, Helen encourages him to hide in her bedroom, where he escapes through the window.|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{went up to}} a wicket marked [...] "Accountant." [...] The {{accountant}} was a tall, cool devil. <b>The</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> rattled me. My {{voice was}} sepulchral.|$|R
2500|$|The suite {{begins with}} the opera's orchestral prelude, {{depicting}} the night of passion (vividly portrayed by whooping horns) between the Marschallin and Octavian. Next comes the appearance of Octavian as the [...] "Rosenkavalier", which is depicted in tender music; <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> looking so young makes the Marschallin realise that he will soon leave her for a younger woman. There follows the duet between Octavian and Sophie (oboe and horn) – in which their {{love for each other}} becomes ever more obvious, but this is abruptly interrupted by the discordant music associated with the clumsy arrival of Ochs. Next the violins tentatively introduce the first waltz, which is followed by another given out by the solo violin, before the whole orchestra settles into waltz mode. A general pause and a violin solo leads into the nostalgic music where the Marschallin sadly realises she has lost Octavian. Then comes its ecstatic climax. The work closes with a singularly robust waltz, depicting Ochs at his most pompous, and a boisterous coda newly composed for the suite.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> frightened Peter, {{striking}} a chill to his heart.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} thinks of that," [...] said Marian--"I mean perhaps he would not think of your caring for <b>the</b> mere <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a pleasure." ...|$|R
60|$|Laverick {{was silent}} for a moment. His {{companion}} watched his face eagerly. After all, why not let him go? He was no help, no comfort. <b>The</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was contemptible.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she answered. [...] "Sometimes I hate <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Sometimes I feel {{almost as}} you do. And at others, well, I can't explain it. It isn't any use trying." ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> the Wizard's {{face flushed}} for a moment, {{with a look}} of his old perplexity.|$|E
60|$|He stepped {{a little}} way out from the shrubs, showing himself cautiously. She stopped short at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|At <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> she coloured, {{letting the}} cloth fall {{from her hand}} which {{remained}} about {{the neck of the}} marble.|$|E
60|$|If Slone {{had been}} inattentive to his {{surroundings}} before, <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Cordts electrified <b>him.</b>|$|R

If the ship {{came up in the}} day-time, at six o'clock in the evening he'd be at the wharf gate waiting for me; and if it came up at night she was no sooner made fast than 'e was over the side patting my trouser-pocket and saying wot a good job it was for both of us that I was in steady employment.|$|R
60|$|Even {{though the}} Russian {{knew that he}} was safe from his enemy, <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> threw him into a frenzy of {{trembling}} cowardice, which became frantic hysteria as he saw the white giant dive fearlessly into the forbidding waters of the tropical river.|$|R
60|$|But already Asad {{had left}} his side and passed out under the arched gateay, where the grovelling anew at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|I did not reply. I {{stood looking}} at him in silence. For <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> had opened up {{a new line of}} thought.|$|E
60|$|Sydney Courtlaw {{followed}} his timid knock. Anna {{raised her eyebrows}} at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He was in evening dress: swallow-tailed coat and white tie.|$|E
6000|$|That was Joe Langley. Do {{you wonder}} they forgot {{he was once}} a milk-man, or that every {{resident}} of Dorfield swelled with pride at <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> Just one <b>of</b> [...] "our soldier boys," [...] {{just one of the}} boys the Liberty Girls were trying to assist.|$|R
60|$|She {{tried not}} to look at him; <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> filled her with horror--that blotched, gaunt face of his, the fleshy lips, that hideous bandage across his face that hid one of his eyes! She {{tried not to}} see him and not to hear him laugh.|$|R

60|$|He went {{in through}} the garden. Clara and the Doctor were sitting {{together}} in the dining-room. She sprang to her feet at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "With those words, he {{released}} me from <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I waited a minute alone, to recover {{myself in the}} air, {{and then returned to}} the house.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the youth}} started towards him gleefully, as if <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> had dispelled all melancholy musings, and shouted merrily, [...] "Welcome--welcome, Adam! Why so early home? Have the Alton boors turned surly? or are the King's prickers abroad, and the {{neighbourhood}} unwholesome for bold clerks of St. Nicholas?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} know, Mildred, I detest your friend Lord Minster, <b>the</b> mere <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> sets my teeth on edge, and I {{did not want to}} meet him.

6000|$|... "Oh, I shouldn't wonder! And she's an {{extraordinarily}} attractive woman. I'm full of complaints, Everard. There's that other horrible little man, Seaman.

60|$|But George Pendyce, who saw {{him from}} the window of the Stoics' Club, smiled a {{different}} smile; <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was always a little unpleasant to George.|$|E

6000|$|... "What use, Jeffrey? If <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> means death, {{death will}} come. Moreover, I believe {{nothing of the}} tale. Your ghost was some forest reeve or herdsman." ...|$|E
5000|$|That evening, {{he sleeps}} at the Hotel Formule 1 in the town, {{where he is}} {{captured}} on film by a surveillance camera - <b>the</b> last known <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The man {{was tall}} and raw-boned, with a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails. [...] <b>The</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> with one grimy thumb buried deep in the lukewarm stew, that seemed, from the {{frequency}} of its repetition, to constitute the pride of his culinary art, was sufficient {{to take away the}} girl's appetite.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Mrs. Bernstone," [...] said Sholto. [...] "She is {{the only}} woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment." [...] He hurried for the door, and knocked in his {{peculiar}} way. We could see a tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
