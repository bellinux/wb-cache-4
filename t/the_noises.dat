5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded to be used in <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> of the dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>noise</b> {{properties}} of tubes at audio frequencies can be modeled well by a perfect noiseless tube having {{a source of}} voltage noise in series with the grid. For the EF86 tube, for example, this voltage noise is specified (see e.g., the Valvo, Telefunken or Philips data sheets) as 2 microvolts integrated over a frequency range of approximately 25 Hz to 10 kHz. (This refers to <b>the</b> integrated <b>noise,</b> see below for the frequency dependence of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> spectral density.) This equals <b>the</b> voltage <b>noise</b> of a 25 kΩ resistor. Thus, if the signal source has an impedance of 25 kΩ or more, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of <b>the</b> tube is actually smaller than <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of <b>the</b> source. For a source of 25 kΩ, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> generated by tube and source are the same, so <b>the</b> total <b>noise</b> power at <b>the</b> output of the amplifier is twice <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> power at <b>the</b> output of the perfect amplifier. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> figure is then two, or 3 dB. For higher impedances, such as 250 kΩ, <b>the</b> EF86's voltage <b>noise</b> is [...] lower than <b>the</b> sources's own <b>noise.</b> It therefore adds 1/10 of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> power caused by the source, and <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> figure is 0.4 dB. For a low-impedance source of 250 Ω, on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> voltage contribution of the tube is 10 {{times larger than the}} signal source, so that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> power is one hundred times larger than that caused by <b>the</b> source. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> figure in this case is 20 dB.|$|R

25|$|Around {{the same}} time that Olivier made his attack, Salme's Advanced Guard and Watrin's division, which had {{previously}} been in reserve, crossed the Trebbia on the far right flank. Moving in two bodies, the French force brushed aside the Austrian outpost line. The right thrust reached Ca' Pernici on the Po's south bank while the left thrust carried almost to Calendasco. Here Watrin paused because <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> from Olivier's fight were not encouraging. By this time, Melas had Olivier on the run and wished to attack across the Trebbia. Hearing of the Watrin-Salme incursion, the Austrian general was forced to deal with it first. Melas sent Liechtenstein with a task force composed of one squadron of the Lobkowitz Dragoons, two squadrons of the Archduke Joseph Hussars, 200 Cossacks and nine companies of infantry. Meanwhile, an artillery battery detached from the Mantua siege corps under the command of Colonel Kinsky unlimbered on the north bank of the Po. The Austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies, encouraging them in their decision to recross the Trebbia though the Austrians made prisoners of 300 French. The firing ended in the northern sector about 9:00 pm. The French maintained a firm grip on {{the west bank of the}} Trebbia, but MacDonald's division commanders were not able to give him any estimate of their remaining strength. In a scene of horror, thousands of dead and wounded soldiers littered the bed of the Trebbia while Piacenza's Austrian garrison blindly fired cannons into the night. Realizing that neither Moreau nor La Poype were coming to his assistance, MacDonald issued the orders to retreat at 10:00 pm. As soon as the engineers bridged the Nure River, the artillery and wagon train were sent across, followed by the infantry starting about midnight.|$|E

25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb.

According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Development of {{a passive}} {{respiratory}} motion sensor based on <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance of <b>the</b> receive coil array. Methods: Respiratory motion alters the body resistance. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> variance of an RF coil {{depends on the}} body resistance and, thus, is also modulated by respiration. For <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance monitoring, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> samples were acquired without and with MR signal excitation on clinical 1. 5 / 3 T MR scanners. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> sensor was compared with the respiratory bellow and with the diaphragm displacement visible on MR images. Several breathing patterns were tested. Results: <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> variance demonstrated a periodic, temporal modulation that was synchronized with the respiratory bellow signal. The modulation depth of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance resulting from the respiration varied between the channels of the array and depended on the channel's location with respect to <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> sensor combined with MR acquisition was able to detect the respiratory motion for every k-space read-out line. Conclusion: Within clinical MR systems, the respiratory motion can be detected by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> in receive array. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> sensor does not require careful positioning unlike the bellow, any additional hardware, and/or MR acquisition...|$|R

Dancing partners Fred and Adele Astaire moved into a penthouse flat at No.41 in 1923, and stayed there during their theatrical appearances at London's West End.

The transmitter indexes {{through at least}} two noise records which comprise a series of randomly generated samples, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> records being divided into noise segments, to maintain a current noise segment for each <b>noise</b> record. <b>The</b> transmitter modulates a predefined base signal using the segments of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> records to represent the symbols of the base signal. In modulating the predefined base signal, the transmitter replaces the respective symbols of the base signal with <b>the</b> current <b>noise</b> segments from <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> records, thereby generating a noise signal in which the symbols can not be discerned. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> signal is transmitted across a communications channel to the receiver which demodulates <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> signal into <b>the</b> base signal.
