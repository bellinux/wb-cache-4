5|$|By 1946, Van Buren was {{considered}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the league. Before the season, he signed a three-year contract to remain with the Eagles, dispelling rumors that he planned to join the rival All-America Football Conference. He returned just five punts in the 1946 season, but ran one of them back fifty yards for a touchdown against the Boston Yanks in the final game of the year. It was the last punt Van Buren returned in his career. He finished the season with 529 rushing yards, third-most behind leader Bill Dudley of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rookie Pat Harder of the Chicago Cardinals. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the New York Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by the United Press.|$|E

The 1971–72 season was their last season in top division as the team finished last with 20points. Mladen Kranjc, one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> history of the club, was the best goalscorer for the team in each of its five seasons spent in the Yugoslav top division, having scored a total of 54league goals, which eventually led to his transfer to one of the top Yugoslav clubs, Dinamo Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> {{the world}} in his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, is physically strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; {{in addition to his}} physical attributes, he is also comfortable on the ball and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, versatile and hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch.

5|$|Since 1889, Wisden has {{published}} a list of Cricketers of the Year, typically selecting five cricketers that had the greatest impact during the previous English cricket season. However, in the 2000 edition, the editor Matthew Engel recognised that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the world were typically no longer playing English domestic cricket, and opted to select the Cricketers of the Year based on their performances anywhere in the world. This criterion was applied for the following three years, but in 2004 it reverted to being based on the English season, and a Leading Cricketer in the World was also selected. The recipient of the award is selected by the editor of Wisden, with advice from cricket experts. An Australian, Ricky Ponting {{was chosen as the}} first winner of the award, for scoring 1,503 runs in international cricket, including eleven centuries during 2003.|$|E

5|$|England had Stanley Matthews available, who {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> {{the world at the}} time, but he had not played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves. Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1–0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on June 19, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{came through}} La Masia, Barcelona's youth academy, leaving at 16 {{when he was}} signed by Premier League club Arsenal in September 2003. Following {{injuries}} to key midfielders {{in the early part}} of the 2004–05 season, he went on establish himself in the team. He broke several of the club's records in the process, earning a reputation as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> his position, and won the FA Cup in 2005. After a protracted transfer saga, Fàbregas left London on 15 August 2011 to return to Barcelona in a deal worth up to £35million. During his three-year spell at the Camp Nou, Fàbregas played alongside Xavi and Andrés Iniesta and won a La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, the FIFA Club World Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and two Spanish Super Cups. He returned to London in June 2014 to Arsenal's cross-town rivals Chelsea for a fee of £30million, and in his first year there he helped to secure League Cup and Premier League triumphs.|$|E

5|$|Harry Bradshaw, {{appointed}} {{in the summer}} of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players.</b> <b>In</b> his five years at Arsenal, he managed to steer the club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905–06 and 1906–07 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949, {{following}} the death of Jimmy Dunne, Paddy Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the League of Ireland. Coad opted for a radical youth policy and {{over the course of his}} first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team's leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as Coad's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> Northwestern Ontario, Phillips moved east to Montreal in September 1902 {{to study}} {{electrical}} engineering at McGill University. He joined the university's hockey team, which had just {{moved to a new}} Canadian university league, and was immediately named captain. Phillips only played one match for McGill, on January 23, 1903 against Queen's University; McGill lost 7–0. Days after the game the Montreal Hockey Club asked Phillips to join them for their Stanley Cup challenge series against the Winnipeg Victorias. This required the approval of the other university clubs, which agreed on the condition that Phillips end his McGill career, which he did. Montreal won the series, with Phillips finishing third on the team in scoring with six goals in four games. Phillips also earned praise for his defensive efforts, in particular his ability to stop Tony Gingras.|$|E
