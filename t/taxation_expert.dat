40|$|The {{question}} of whether a country’s corporate tax regime has a significant influence on the level of foreign direct investment into that country is an important consideration in the design of national tax policy. This is especially true today in view of the recent increase in the global mobility of capital and subsequent increase in the importance of FDI to nations’ economies. However, research to date on this question has so far yielded inconclusive results. By obtaining evaluations from <b>taxation</b> <b>experts</b> of the various attributes of the tax systems of selected countries, this study constructs indices of corporate tax attractiveness for those countries. It then analyses the relationship between those indices and data concerning the flow of foreign direct investment into those countries. No statistically significant relations hip was found to exist between the indices and the various measures of capital inflows.

40|$|The {{importance}} of considering Taxation 1 a specialised {{field of study}} is often ignored because people assume that taxation is already adequately dealt with in other disciplines. It is therefore imperative to identify or construct the Fundamental Principles of Taxation to establish Taxation as a specialised field of study {{for the purposes of}} research and education, and to inform the practice. The theory of the discipline of Taxation encompasses the most basic principles required to comprehend Taxation. By contrast, taxation policy addresses the practical arena of taxation, including the collection and spending of tax revenue, as well as citizens contributions. Bearing in mind the many nuances of taxation, their possible roots and their relevance in practice, education and research, this study asked the following question: What are the Fundamental Principles in Taxation that are essential to Taxation internationally both in the present, and as Taxation evolves into the future? The aim {{of the study was to}} construct Fundamental Principles for Taxation. A multi-method qualitative research design was chosen, allowing the triangulation of three sets of findings. This multi-method design allowed the limitations of every data collection method to be offset by the strengths of other methods. The research design provided depth to the picture of the phenomenon of interest, namely the Fundamental Principles of Taxation. The first data collection strategy was an extensive historical review (Method 1). This method was supported by a thematic analysis using Atlas ti of the aspects of taxation history that were identified. The second method was an Interactive Qualitative Analysis, a systematically executed focus group activity conducted with international <b>experts</b> on <b>Taxation</b> (Method 2). The third method was the presentation of a single question to international <b>Taxation</b> <b>experts</b> to elicit written responses (Method 3). A thematic analysis of their responses was conducted using Atlas ti. Three sets of taxation principles emerged from these discrete analyses. These sets of principles were then triangulated to achieve a synthesis to answer the research question: What are the Fundamental Principles in Taxation? The process of triangulation led to the construction of six Fundamental Principles of Taxation. Each was supported by a rich description, compiled as an outcome of the analysis. The six principles are achieving (i) Efficient and effective administration and communication, (ii) Certain, neutral, understandable legislation, (iii) Equity influencing different levels of society, (iv) Taxpayers duty to contribute to society versus the government s duty to find a balance between taking too little and taking too much, (v) Benefits to the public through taxation, and (vi) Changes to unwanted social behaviour. The application of Taxation is still evolving in terms of Taxation s interdisciplinary role in the international economic and socio-political arena, where tax policies are made and tax systems are implemented in the unique circumstances of every country. Future research will draw more countries into the discussion and include more disciplines in an attempt to adhere to the true interdisciplinary nature of Taxation. Against this background, a tentative universal set of Fundamental Principles of Taxation was constructed and proposed.

Throughout the world, governments are searching for better taxation systems than those we are familiar with to finance the activities of local authorities. Every known local taxation system includes some snag, drawback, or disadvantage to the individual or to the community. Land and <b>taxation</b> policy <b>experts</b> continually study and compare the existing systems, as well as proposals to ameliorate them. In “A Politician’s Appraisal of Property Taxation: Israel’s Experience with the Arnona,” the system is first summarized for those are unfamiliar with this, the arnona, Israel’s unique form of local tax. The arnona has a tremendous effect on local authorities in the country, as it is by far their main source of income. In Tel Aviv, for instance, it provides nearly two-thirds of the city’s annual income. At first glance, the arnona seems to be a very non-sophisticated system, especially compared with the advanced CAMA [Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal] and/or the ad valorem property tax. However, upon closer scrutiny, the taxation scholar discovers several distinct advantages of the arnona system, and a potential for application in many other countries, once some of the disadvantages are overcome.
