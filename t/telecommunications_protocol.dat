WIMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>protocol</b> that provides fixed and fully mobile internet access. Wired network refers to interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802. 3 and WIMAX which refers to interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802. 16 wireless-networks standard.

Now this paper proposed a new hybrid network that is the communication between two different technologies on the basis of Foreign Agent (FA), Home Agent (HA) and Mobile Host (MH). Now the FA is worked as a interface in between wired and WIMAX network and FA is connected with wired network to synchronize the communication with WIMAX, first the request is goes to FA then to network.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a system that}} automatically generates Java classes from a given declaration of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN. 1) data structures in order to code and decode the corresponding ASN. 1 structures. The ASN. 1 standard is a formal notation used for describing data transmitted by telecommunication systems. Whenever a new <b>telecommunications</b> <b>protocol</b> is developed all previously undefined data structures have to be constructed, a process requiring substantial programming resources to generate the translation code. Due to the iterative nature of this process there is significant potential to automate this process. Taking into consideration the complexity of ASN. 1, {{the goal of this}} project was to develop a program design that was modular in structure which would later allow for ease of extension. The forthcoming concept is based on the 'Pipes and Filters' design pattern which provides good expandability and flexible configuration, a model well suited to integrate a template mechanism for the production of desired ASN. 1 data types. The parser generator JavaCC and Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) are used as base technologies for the implementation of this concept, whereas specific pipeline filters are implemented using XSL style sheets. Each building block of the generation process is analyzed and assigned to an independent module (called filter). Afterwards the implementation of the code generator is explained in connection with the concept mentioned above. Prototype classes are defined as a basis for realizing different ASN. 1 data types. Implementation of the defined concepts uses the CODEC library, a Java library for coding and decoding ASN. 1 data structures when implementing network protocols or other tasks within cryptographic environments, e. g.

This forum is a consortium of industry, academia, and government entities formed to quickly develop standards for the ATM infrastructure. However, because the participants represent a predominately terrestrial network viewpoint, the use of satellites in the national and global information infrastructures could be severely compromised. Consequently, through an ongoing task order, the NASA Lewis Research Center asked Sterling Software, Inc., to communicate with the ATM Forum in support of the interoperability of satellite-terrestrial networks. This year, Dr. Raj Jain of the Ohio State University, under contract to Sterling, authored or coauthored 32 explanatory documents delivered to the ATM Forum in the areas of Guaranteed Frame Rate for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Available Bit Rate, performance testing, Variable Bit Rate voice over ATM, TCP over Unspecified Bit Rate+, Virtual Source/Virtual Destination, and network management.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} two {{applications of}} functional programming to process formal and natural languages. The techniques {{described in this}} thesis are closely connected to compiler construction, which is obvious in the work on BNF Converter. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the BNFC (the BNF Converter) application, a multi-lingual compiler tool. BNFC takes as its input a grammar written in Labelled BNF (LBNF) notation, and generates a compiler front-end (an abstract syntax, a lexer, and a parser). Furthermore, it generates a case skeleton usable as the starting point of back-end construction, a pretty printer, a test bench, and a Latex document usable as a language specification. The program components can be generated in Haskell, Java, C and C++, and their standard parser and lexer tools. BNFC itself was written in Haskell. The methodology used for the generated front-end is based on Appel's books on compiler construction. BNFC {{has been used as a}} teaching tool in compiler construction courses at Chalmers. It has also beenapplied to research-related programming language development, and in an industrial application producing a compiler for a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>protocol</b> description language. The second part of the thesis describes Functional Morphology, a toolkit for implementing natural language morphology in the functional language Haskell. The main idea behind is simple: instead of working with untyped regular expressions, which is the state of the art of morphology in computational linguistics, we use finite functions over hereditarily finite algebraic data types. The definitions of these data types and functions are the language-dependent part of the morphology. The language-independent part consists of an untyped dictionary format which is used for translation to other morphology formats and synthesis of word forms, and to generate a decorated trie, which is used for analysis. Functional Morphology builds on ideas introduced by Huet in his computational linguistics toolkit Zen, which he has used to implement the morphology of Sanskrit. The goal has been to make it easy for linguists who are not trained as functional programmers, to apply the ideas to new languages. As a proof of the productivity of the method, morphologies for Swedish, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Latin have already been implemented...|$|E
