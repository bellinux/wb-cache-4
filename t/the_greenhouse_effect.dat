5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatology, {{although}} sometimes {{treated as}} part of paleoecology, focuses more {{on the history of}} Earth's climate and the mechanisms that have changed it – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments, for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> and thus helping to cause an ice age in the Carboniferous period.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for <b>the</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> <b>Effect</b> and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect,</b> causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
40|$|In {{assessing}} {{the impacts of}} climate change/global warming, {{the magnitude of the}} Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide is an important parameter. The Earth’s warming can come from <b>the</b> direct <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> of more anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide, and it can also come from some indirect effects such as water vapor feedback. The fact that the outward infrared radiation can only pass through a restricted wave-length window set up by all <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>greenhouse</b> gases also contributes to the indirect ef-fects. For the Earth this contribution partially ameliorates <b>the</b> direct <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> and other indirect effects...|$|R

25|$|Terraforming Venus {{requires}} {{two major}} changes; removing {{most of the}} planet's dense 9MPa carbon dioxide atmosphere and reducing the planet's 450°C (723.15K) surface temperature.

40|$|In this paper, we scrutinize two {{completely}} different explanations of <b>the</b> so-called atmospheric <b>greenhouse</b> effect: First, <b>the</b> {{explanation of the}} American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the World Meteorological Organization (W?MO) quan- tifying this effect by two characteristic temperatures, secondly, the explanation of Ramanathan et al. [1] that is mainly based on an energy-flux budget for the Earth-atmosphere system. Both explanations {{are related to the}} global scale. In addition, we debate the meaning of climate, climate change, climate variability and climate variation to outline in which way <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> might be responsible for climate change and climate variability, respectively. In doing so, we distinguish between two different branches of climatology, namely 1) physical climatology in which the boundary conditions of the Earth-atmosphere system play the dominant role and 2) statistical climatology that is dealing with the statistical description of fortuitous weather events which had been happening in climate periods; each of them usually comprises 30 years. Based on our findings, we argue that 1) <b>the</b> so-called atmospheric <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> cannot be proved by the statistical description of fortuitous weather events that took place in a climate period, 2) the description by AMS and W?MO has to be discarded because of physical reasons, 3) energy-flux budgets for the Earth-atmosphere system do not provide tangible evidence that <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> does exist. Because of this lack of tangible evidence it is time to acknowledge that <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> and especially its climatic impact are based on meritless conjectures...|$|R
5000|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gases, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface. They calculate with confidence that CO2 {{has been responsible for}} over half <b>the</b> enhanced <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect.</b> They predict that under a [...] "business as usual" [...] (BAU) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °C per decade during the 21st century. They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability. The unequivocal detection of <b>the</b> enhanced <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> is not likely for a decade or more.|$|R
25|$|Tetrafluoromethane is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas that contributes to <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect.</b> It is very stable, has an atmospheric lifetime of 50,000 years, and a high greenhouse warming potential of 6500 (which is given for the first 100 years thereof, CO2 has a factor of 1); however, the low amount in the atmosphere restricts the overall radiative forcing effect.|$|E
25|$|Carbon in the Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{exists in}} two main forms: {{carbon dioxide and}} methane. Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect.</b> Methane produces a larger greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide, but it exists in much lower concentrations and is more short-lived than carbon dioxide, making carbon dioxide the more important greenhouse gas of the two.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{predictions}} of <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>effect</b> is that the stratosphere will cool. Although this cooling has been observed, it is not trivial to separate the effects {{of changes in the}} concentration of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion since both will lead to cooling. However, this can be done by numerical stratospheric modeling. Results from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory show that above , the greenhouse gases dominate the cooling.|$|E
