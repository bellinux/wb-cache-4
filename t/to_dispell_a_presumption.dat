Comments are made about research on utility and choice, mobility and migration, and cognitive mapping in <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>dispell</b> these myths [...] or at least to inhibit their further development and acceptance. ...|$|R

The goal of this study is <b>to</b> <b>dispell</b> the idea that the behaviour of mobile systems can be modelled as being homogenous across various locations. The study shows that all volunteers access statistically significantly different sets of data as they move across locations. These results question the traditional way of evaluating mobile computing systems, which typically model the behavior of a user in different locations as being similar to her behavior in a single location for a longer period. 1...|$|R

She addressed her letters, meditated on them for a time, and then took them out and posted them.
