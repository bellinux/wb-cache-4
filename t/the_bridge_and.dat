5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|A. L. Dolby & Company was {{contracted}} {{to complete the}} rail line between <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> Kingston. The track reached the Kingston Union Station in November 1872. By this time, trains were running regularly to and from Kingston.|$|E
5|$|According to the Prose Edda, {{the bridge}} ends in heaven at Himinbjörg, the {{residence}} of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar.

5|$|After the {{parachute}} brigade withdrew, the Axis forces {{gathered at the}} bridge. They now comprised the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Arditi Battalion, with the German 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain Stangenberg's Battle group. The German High Command {{was aware of the}} importance of holding <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment. The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> a smaller one on the southern bank.|$|E

5|$|Engineer Thomas Page was {{appointed}} to build <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> presented the Commission with several potential designs, including a seven-span stone bridge, a five-span cast iron arch bridge, and a suspension bridge. The Commission selected the suspension bridge design, and work began in 1851 on the new bridge, {{to be called the}} Victoria Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders to compensate for the missing piers.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone.

5|$|In 1962, Richmond Council {{announced}} {{the replacement of}} the gaslamps on the bridge with electric lighting. The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as he believed it would be cheaper to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> the plan never went through.|$|E
5|$|In December 2002, Chapter XII of the SOLAS {{convention}} was amended {{to require the}} installation of high-level water alarms and monitoring systems on all bulkers. This safety measure quickly alerts watch standers on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> in the engine room in case of flooding in the holds. In cases of catastrophic flooding, these detectors could speed the process of abandoning ship.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of a new 485 m long, 4-lane bridge commenced in May 2008. The A$148 million Forgan <b>Bridge</b> Replacement <b>and</b> Duplication Project included replacement of two bridges; <b>the</b> Forgan <b>Bridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Barnes Creek <b>Bridge,</b> <b>and</b> widening of Barnes Creek Road. <b>The</b> existing two-lane <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> road were replaced with new four-lane <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road. The project was delivered in two stages; stage 1 included {{construction of}} a new two-lane <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> stage 2 included demolition of <b>the</b> existing <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> {{construction of a}}nother two-lane bridges in their place.|$|R
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the greater}} {{volume of traffic}} using the humpbacked bridge, which had poor {{visibility}} and narrow approach roads, led to a rise in accidents {{and an increase in}} bypass proposals. Many similar bridge towers were completely demolished starting as early as the 18th century due to the desire of local authorities to clear carriageways of all obstructions to improve traffic flow. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> gate were formally protected as an Ancient Monument in 1923, and proposals for a new road bridge began to be made about the same time. The new A40, built in 1965–6, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the District Council in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a double-decker bus struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> gate through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.|$|E
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody.

5|$|Most {{noticeable}} of the N3 {{design was}} {{the concentration of}} the main battery forward of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> machinery spaces. A related feature of the design was the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November, Hill {{visited the}} {{commanding}} officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab, and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion. Hill attached 'R' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured. German forces soon arrived at <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> their commanding officer demanded that they {{be allowed to take}} control of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> cross it to attack the British positions. The French rejected the German demands, and in conjunction with 'R' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours. The battalion was reinforced by the U.S. 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but, despite fierce resistance, the German forces proved to be too strong, and by 04:30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding area to the Germans. Two days later, Hill received information that a strong Italian force, which included a number of tanks, was stationed at Gue Hill. Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks, and the following night moved the battalion, less a small guard detachment that remained at Béja, to Sidi N'Sir where it linked up with a force of French Senegalese infantry. Hill decided that the battalion's section of 3inch mortars would cover 'R' and 'S' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force, while a small force of sappers would mine the road {{at the rear of the}} hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat.|$|E
5|$|On July2, 1935, the Rip Van Winkle Bridge {{over the}} Hudson River between Catskill and Greenport was opened to traffic. It {{became part of}} a realigned NY23 after the Athens–Hudson ferry shut down in the late 1940s. NY23 {{utilized}} modern NY23B between <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> Hudson. Plans {{were made in the}} early 1950s to construct a southern bypass of the city of Hudson between the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and NY23 midway between Claverack and Hollowville. Construction on the portion of the highway between <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> US9 south of Hudson began in the mid-1950s and was completed in the late 1950s as a realignment of NY23. Ultimately, this was the only section that was built; as a result, NY23 overlapped with US9 and NY9H to reach its former alignment in Claverack.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each {{direction}} of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways.
