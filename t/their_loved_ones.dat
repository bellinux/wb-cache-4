5|$|An {{original}} non-canon story {{set in the}} legendarium {{created by}} J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge the deaths of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Players can engage in melee combat, and use wraith abilities to fight and manipulate enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember {{the deaths of the}} game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to reach them to take a lock of hair or some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E
5000|$|Palliative care is an {{especially}} demanding task for cancer caregivers than less progressive cancer because the care required for those with terminal cancer {{tends to be more}} demanding. [...] Caregivers in this situation often report high caregiver burden lasting the entire period. Caregiver distress also tends to increase as patients progress through this phase, causing a lower caregiver quality of life. Having a difficult time with caregiving increases distress caregivers face as they enter the bereavement period after the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> whereas finding meaning in caring for <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> may relate to better long term adjustment for caregivers. Before bereavement, <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> often face anticipatory grief, where they mourn and prepare for the loss of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> Families often react with fears of abandonment, anxiety, hopelessness and helplessness, and an intensified attachment to <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> Upon the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> caregivers typically experience grief, which in a minority of cases may be complicated by a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder later in the grief process.|$|R

They tried to kill Kobayashi, but he strong-armed them into performing the heist by threatening <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> They staked out the ship and killed several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters, but found no drugs on board. McManus, Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person, who also killed Keaton and set the ship on fire as Verbal looked on.|$|E
5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E

5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

40|$|This {{review of}} {{literature}} describes recently published research on preparing family members {{for the death of}} <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> with advanced cancer and discusses directions for further research. A search was conducted among 5 electronic databases. A total of 18 articles published between January 2000 and September 2011 were identified and included in this review. The literature revealed that the current trends of research are to study (1) the awareness of family members of the impending death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and (2) the 4 dimensions of preparedness. Comprehensive studies needed are to explore family members' preparation for the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> with advanced cancer, including the awareness and time frame of family members for the death of a <b>loved</b> one; <b>their</b> preparedness including medical, psychosocial, spiritual, and practical dimensions; and communication and support received from healthcare professionals. Expanding understanding of preparing family members for the death will enable healthcare professionals to develop innovative interventions to improve family members' preparation for the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and to ease their bereavement.

5|$|In September 2011, Simon Bates {{presented}} {{a week of}} programmes from South Australia {{as part of a}} promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are {{a list of}} propositions for an {{academic}} disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany, that started the Reformation, a schism in the Catholic Church which profoundly changed Europe. They advance Luther's positions against {{what he saw as}} abusive in the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> in purgatory. In the Theses, Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope, the Theses challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences.|$|E

5|$|Thongs and Octopus {{are taken}} to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The study {{presented}} in this thesis provides a description and interpretation of the experiences of family members during <b>their</b> older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. Fourteen women, aged 51 to 74 years, {{participated in the study}} and, over an interview period of nineteen months, described their experiences. These twelve daughters and two wives supported and cared for <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> at home, in residential aged care and/or while hospitalised. The approach used to explore the women’s experiences was existential phenomenology, informed by the philosophies of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Changing family portraits: Sudden existential absence during delirium depicts the women’s experiences during <b>their</b> older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. Existential absence for these women was experienced as the sudden absence of <b>their</b> familiar older <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and the arrival of a stranger. The meaning of existential absence is further represented by the theme Living the fragility of a <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> presence and the sub-themes Facing a <b>loved</b> <b>one's</b> existential absence and Living with a stranger, as well as the theme Living life holding on and the sub-themes Waiting for a <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> In the dark, On the fringe but centre stage, On thin ice, and Keeping secrets. These themes describe the unexpected and distressing nature of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> absence during delirium, and how difficult it was for the women to cope and await <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> return. The description and interpretation {{presented in}} this thesis reveals the profound impact of family member experiences during <b>their</b> older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. It establishes the importance of health care staff appreciating family member experiences and relates the insights gained to health care practice, suggesting how family member experiences can inform ways health care staff include family members in their older person’s care and provide compassionate, sensitive support during delirium...|$|R
