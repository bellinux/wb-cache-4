The two-hyphen em dash proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the typewriting era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the Chicago Manual of Style as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that <b>typewritten</b> <b>manuscript</b> and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen em dash proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, en dash, and em dash, respectively.|$|E

50|$|After {{the failure}} to {{establish}} communist rule in Lithuania, Angarietis retreated to Russia to never visit Lithuania again. First he lived in Smolensk (1920-1922) then in Moscow. Angarietis remained involved with CPL, remaining a member of its Politburo and supervising its underground activities. He wrote numerous books, essays, and pamphlets - his <b>typewritten</b> <b>manuscripts</b> were collected in 48 volumes of 200-300 pages each. Šarmaitis counted a total of 147 works published as separate works, mostly booklets and brochures, before 1940. However, attribution is sometimes difficult as Angarietis wrote under a plethora of pseudonyms. Many of his works were devoted {{to the history of}} the Communist Party and the revolutionary movement tracing the class conflict since the feudalism. In 1921, he wrote a 480-page manuscript on the history of CPL and accused Kapsukas of many practical and ideological mistakes that led to their failure. The conflict was quickly suppressed by Russian communist leaders.|$|R

40|$|Joseph Roth {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Austrian writers of the first half of the 20 th century. Particularly his novels and newspaper essays gained him the respect of contemporary critics. Joseph Roth's papers at the Leo Baeck Institute Archives consist of handwritten and <b>typewritten</b> <b>manuscripts</b> of novels, novellas, short stories, and essays, including mostly complete manuscripts of his works (The Ballad of the Hundred Days), (The Bust of the Emperor), and his 'Trozki' novel (The Silent Prophet). Joseph Roth's journalistic work is also well represented. There are a few personal items and over one hundred photographs of Joseph Roth and his wife Friederike. The Joseph Roth collection also contains correspondence with family and publishers, clippings about Joseph Roth, and reviews of his work. The addenda mostly consist of invitations to conferences and exhibitions, and scholarly articles on Joseph Roth's work and life. Video tape of a Dutch TV-movie by Hans Keller, "Joseph Roth's Grosse-Welt Bioskop-Theater", has been removed to the A/V Collection. Joseph Roth was born in Brody in Galicia, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy, now Ukraine, on September 26, 1894 in the family of Maria (Miriam) Roth nee Gruebel and Nahum Roth. He worked as a journalist before focusing on writing novels and short stories. Joseph Roth died in the Necker hospital in Paris on May 27, 1939. His wife, Friederike (Friedl), who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1928, lived in an Austrian mental sanatorium, where she was killed in the Nazi euthanasia program in 1940. EAD finding aid available onlineThe more substantial part of the collection comes from the Joseph Roth estate that his French translator, Blanche Gidon, preserved during the Second World War. After the war, Joseph Roth's cousin, Fred Grubel, picked up a suitcase with Joseph Roth's papers from her and transferred them to the United States. It took several years until the rights and heritage procedures were cleared up. In January 1963, the bulk of the collection arrived at the Leo Baeck Institute Archives. The papers of Joseph Roth were arranged into six series that were assigned call numbers AR 1836 -AR 1841. Later on, Fred Grubel, the executive director of the Leo Baeck Institute, added materials about Joseph Roth that he had been collecting since the end of the war. This addition contained correspondence related to the fate of the collection after the war, reviews of Joseph Roth's works published after 1945, and several texts on Joseph Roth. This addendum is complemented by the material from the estate of Friderike Zweig, the widow of Stefan Zweig, donated by Caroline Birman, who took part in clearing the rights and safe-guarded Joseph Roth's papers after their arrival to the United States, in 1963 and 1971. In the 1990 s other material was added, usually invitations to exhibits or conference programs that took place on the occasion of Joseph Roth's anniversaries. Several scholarly and popular articles were also added to the collection. Some of the more significant addenda include a microfilm of the manuscript of the Kapuzinergruft from the St. Etienne Gallery in 1990 mediated by Fritz Hackert (MF 453); as well as catalog cards and the inventory of the so-called Berliner Nachlass from the Schiller- Nationalmuseum und deutschen Literaturarchiv, Marbach am Neckar, Germany in 1995 (q PT 2635 O_ 84 Z 312). Published in LBI Bulletin No. 25, 1964. Letters of Joseph Roth to his parents are available at the Dokumentationsstelle für neuere oesterreichische Literature (Vienna, Austria).

40|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} personal items, correspondence and manuscripts produced and {{acquired in the}} course of Hermann M. Selzer’s life. The personal items include birth certificates (translations and copies), passports, visas, school and university records of Kate and Hermann Selzer (Universities of Cologne and Berlin, Medical Academy of Duesseldorf); Awards of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesverdienstkreuz) and the Salvation Army; various documents recording Hermann Selzer’s occupations, especially his membership and grades in masonry lodges, but also German insurance forms, documents on bank deposits, his wife’s cookbook. Also included documents and correspondence of Hermann Selzer with German authorities, concerning his efforts to regain the German citizenship. The bulk of the collection consists of <b>typewritten</b> <b>manuscripts</b> of essays (the most of them being nonfictional, but also fictional), containing reflections about Lahore/Pakistan where Hermann Selzer spent his professional life from 1937 to 1971, reflections on his life course, ranging from his childhood and young adult years in Europe trough his professional life in Pakistan to his settlement and retirement in Israel; on religion (mainly Jewry, but also Christianity and Indian religions), on freemasonry, on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Israeli society, on Swiss banks; on his family and friends in Israel, the U. S. and elsewhere. They include a detailed and coherent account on his life course, his parents and grandparents, photos of his own family members and friends. Correspondence contains both letters to and from family members, mainly in the U. S. (1941 — 1981), letters from patients at the Lahore surgery (1952 - 70), and letters to and from different authorities in Germany and Israel. Hermann Marcus Selzer was born in Stryj (then Poland; now Stryi, Ukraine), in 1909 as the second of four children of Moshe Selzer and Deborah (née Spiegel). His father, an orthodox Jew, struggled to support the growing family. In 1914, the family moved to Oberhausen, an industrial town in the Ruhr valley. After finishing high school, Hermann enrolled at the medical school of the university of Cologne. In 1931, upon completion of his preparatory courses, he transferred to the medical academy in Duesseldorf to begin his clinical training. Shortly before his final exams in 1933, he was arrested and incarcerated by the Nazis. Upon his release, Hermann Selzer left for Italy where he met Kate, a former girlfriend, and married her in 1934. Both completed their internships in Rome. As the situation of foreign Jews in Italy began to deteriorate, the couple decided to immigrate to India, then still under the British rule. After brief stays in Palestine and Bombay, Kate and Hermann Selzer settled in Lahore, Pakistan, at that time an underdeveloped, small town, where their first child Hazel, also known as "Pipsi", was born. They opened a medical practice and soon established contacts among the English-speaking and high ranking civil servants. However in December 1940, the family was taken to an internment camp in Southern India as “enemy aliens” until June 1946, when they were able to return to Lahore. Their practice once again prospered thanks to their connections with leaders in politics, government, and the nobility. In addition, Hermann Selzer was an active freemason and he was appointed the District Grand Master of the Pakistan Masonic lodge. In 1971, Hermann Selzer decided to retire in Israel and the family left Lahore. For the next ten years, he worked part-time in various clinics of the student health service. Kate, his wife, suffered from Alzheimer's disease and died in 1986. Hermann Selzer died on November 25, 2007, in Jerusalem. In the course of his life, Hermann Marcus Selzer has been a citizen of Poland, Germany, Pakistan and Israel, and, for five years, a person without citizenship. Although Yiddish and German were his native languages, he became more or less fluent in Italian, English, Urdu and Hebrew.
