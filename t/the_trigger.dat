5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation {{similar to that of the}} Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E

30|$|It is {{remarkable}} that P-wave triggering {{was found in}} regions where NVT has been observed <b>triggered</b> by <b>the</b> passage of surface waves. If <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event in western Shikoku is related to <b>the</b> NVT, P-wave <b>triggering</b> is <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> sequence of NVT. <b>The</b> <b>triggering</b> strain due to P-waves is {{of the order of}} 10 − 8, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> strain found for surface-wave triggering. Miyazawa and Brodsky (2008) observed clear surface-wave <b>triggering</b> when <b>the</b> normal strain changes are at least of the order of 10 − 8. In the present method, the epicenter of <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> events is not well resolved and the depth is not determined, however, the region with a high spectral ratio in western Shikoku corresponds to <b>the</b> locations of <b>triggered</b> NVT during surface-wave arrivals.|$|R

5|$|In 1958, Rica Erickson wrote Triggerplants, {{describing}} habitat, distribution, {{and plant}} forms (ephemeral, creeping, leafy-stemmed, rosette, tufted, scale-leaved, and tropical). It was Erickson that began placing certain species into these morphologically-based groups, {{which may or}} may not resemble true taxonomic divergences. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that research of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> physiology was begun in the lab of Dr. Findlay of Flinders University. Douglas Darnowski added to the growing library of knowledge on Stylidium when he published his book Triggerplants in 2002, describing an overview of habitat, plant morphology, carnivory, and research done to date. Following its publication, he co-founded the International Triggerplant Society.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} source {{location}} {{and timing of}} seismic energy release for <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event by employing the back-projection method (Spudich and Cranswick 1984). In the waveform data, contaminations of coda waves from the mainshock into the onset of body waves from <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event are found at most stations, {{making it difficult to}} identify the onset. The back-projection method determines the event location and timing by evaluating coherent signals in stacked waveform and does not use the onset data. It is anticipated that the method may provide an alternative approach to estimating the source location and timing for such event data. We also reproduce observed waveforms of <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event by using waveforms of smaller-sized events as Green’s functions and infer the source mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event. We verify the estimated source location and mechanism by calculating synthetic waveforms. These source data investigated in this study would contribute to quantitatively studying the causes of observed strong motions, seismic activity around <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event, and stress transfer from the mainshock to <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> event.|$|R
50|$|The vernier {{method is}} more involved. The method {{involves}} a triggerable oscillator and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. <b>The</b> <b>triggered</b> oscillator {{has a slightly}} different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> oscillator has a period that is 1 ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67 ns after the last clock, then <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> oscillator transition will slide by &minus;1 ns after each subsequent clock pulse. <b>The</b> <b>triggered</b> oscillator will be at 66 ns after the next clock, at 65 ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when <b>the</b> <b>triggered</b> oscillator and <b>the</b> clock transition at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time {{that needs to be}} added.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Remote {{triggering}} {{has been}} observed immediately after the arrival of seismic waves from large teleseismic events. <b>The</b> <b>triggered</b> earthquakes which are usually reported as increasing seismicity appear to be excited with some time-delay after the wave arrivals, in agreement with a model based on the frictional law. <b>The</b> event <b>triggering</b> without time-delay {{appears to have a}} fluid-related mechanism and <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> process itself should be different from that of <b>the</b> usually <b>triggered</b> earthquakes. 1...|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. <b>The</b> <b>trigger</b> for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> {{hypothesis}} for codeswitching proposed by Michael Clyne is discussed and tested.

5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to review the {{performances}} of <b>the</b> three <b>triggers</b> using <b>the</b> calorimeters, namely <b>the</b> hadron <b>trigger,</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>trigger</b> and <b>the</b> photon <b>triggers.</b> <b>The</b> previously available numbers were obtained {{at the time of}} the Technical Proposal ((] using the 30 method.

5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
