5|$|Jason first {{appeared}} outside of {{film in the}} 1982 novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3 by Michael Avallone.

The author {{chose to use}} an alternate ending, one that was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the conclusion for his adaptation. In the alternate ending, Chris, {{who is in a}} canoe, hears her boyfriend Rick's voice and immediately runs back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> machete and decapitates her. The next book was not published until 1986, when Simon Hawke adapted Jason Lives. Hawke would also adapt the first three films into novels, and his adaptation of the original Friday the 13th was published in 1987, with novelizations of Part 2 and 3 both being published in 1988. Hawke's first adaptation, Jason Lives, introduced the character of Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, who was supposed to appear in the film before being cut by the studio.
