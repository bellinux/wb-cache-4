500|$|The Akron Community Foundation {{established}} a Dante Lavelli Scholarship Fund in 2010 to help Hudson High athletes pay for college. [...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E
60|$|Wada {{broke in}} upon my {{thoughts}} by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> {{had been sent}} to say that Miss West was serving tea in the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Psha! That {{is simple}} cowardice. He meant {{you not to}} tell me; {{and then when you}} had {{answered}} him without <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> would have had the whip-hand of you." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> lazy, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> slow,::Tell <b>me</b> I'm crazy (maybe I know) ...|$|R
60|$|GREGORY [rising, equally appalled]. Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> alive.|$|R
50|$|Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dareEver <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> will care.I'm certainIt's {{the final}} curtain...|$|R
6000|$|I {{gazed at}} her with a curious glance. [...] "Then why, dear lady, do you keep <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is cruel?" [...] I inquired, {{toasting}} my feet on the fender. [...] "It seems contradictory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jed Sanborn was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> {{had seen}} some wild ducks up here last week," [...] said the doctor's son. [...] "If they are around {{we must keep}} our eyes peeled for them. They are pretty scarce." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, I know {{without your}} <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> offered you money, he consented to our--marriage {{if you would}} give up St. John's. Oh, how could he," [...] she cried. [...] "How could he so misjudge and insult you!" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO. My LATE husband! What do you mean? [clutching him, horror-stricken]. Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> dead.|$|R
6000|$|... “He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he’s</b> disgustingly rich,” Lord Canterville added, pausing {{before their}} {{companion}} {{with his hands}} in his pockets.|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT. Just {{wait and}} say {{something}} nice to Keegan. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> controls nearly as many votes as Father Dempsey himself.|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [coming to {{the back}} of the garden seat, into the light, with Mangan]. I think I shall. He keeps <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> has a presentiment that he is going to die. I never met a man so greedy for sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|He took me {{into the}} dining-room, {{surveyed}} me keenly all over, pronounced me [...] "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his eyes," [...] and then <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> would give me but ten minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately hired servants, a footman, answered it.|$|E
60|$|I saw, by the girl's {{hesitation}} of manner, that if I {{had asked}} for the Count {{in the first instance}} she would only have followed her instructions by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was not at home. She was staggered by the confidence with which I gave her the card. After staring at me, in great perturbation, she went back into the house with my message, closing the door, and leaving me to wait in the garden.|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. [Drawing {{nearer the}} fire.] That old cabby, Monsieur, you remember--they <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> nearly succeeded to gain {{happiness}} the other day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dudley's gone {{clean up}} in the air,' {{explained}} Lady Wetherby, tolerantly. 'A friend of yours called to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> had seen Eustace--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> hasn't seen you, {{but that}} isn't surprising, for he hasn't been to church since June--and he's a vestryman now, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|Norman {{stood for}} a moment at the door, {{surveying}} the court, then walked up to a party of boys, and laid his hand on the shoulder of one, holding a silver fourpence to him. [...] "Anderson Junior," [...] said he, [...] "there's your money. I am not going to let Stoneborough School be turned into a gin palace. I give you notice, it is not to be. Now you are not to bully May junior for <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> did not, I found him out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Miss Swaffer who has all {{the credit}} of the munificence: but in a very few days it came out that Mr. Swaffer had {{presented}} Yanko with a cottage (the cottage you've seen this morning) and something like an acre of ground--had made it over to him in absolute property. Willcox expedited the deed, and I remember him <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> had a great pleasure in making it ready. It recited: 'In consideration of saving the life of my beloved grandchild, Bertha Willcox.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it war just this, yer riverence, as {{makes me}} so hurried about getting the thing done. I heard tell that Tom Ginty, the pig-jobber, has comed home to Dromod {{from where he was}} away tiv' Athlone; and they do be <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> brought a thrifle of money with him; and yer honer knows Mary had half given a promise to Ginty afore he went: and so, yer riverence, lest there be any {{scrimmage}} betwixt Ginty and I, ye see it's as well to get the marriage done off hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} Captain Forster, Doctor?" [...] Isobel Hannay asked, on the {{afternoon}} of his arrival. [...] "Uncle <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is coming to dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What--a quarter?" [...] {{the young}} {{merchant}} exclaimed in surprise. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> bought fifteen cents' worth all at one time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ellmother recoiled from Emily in dismay. [...] "Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> had {{anything}} to do with it! The kindest of men; the best of men!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When poor young Bond {{first came}} to London," [...] said the massive gentleman who was sitting on my left, [...] "I {{remember}} his <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> applied to Lord Barrymore's 'tiger,' Alexander Lee, I mean, of course, who was then running the Strand Theatre, for {{a place in the}} chorus. Lee heard him sing two lines, and then jumped up. 'Thanks, that'll do; good morning,' says Lee. Bond knew he had got a good voice, so he asked Lee what was wrong. 'What's wrong?' shouts Lee. 'Do you think I hire a chorus to show up my principals?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope it's news I'm telling you," [...] he said soberly; [...] "I'm hoping it's {{news when}} I say that I'm here for Mr. Charles Wrexell Allen,--that's the gentleman's name. He's {{after taking a}} hundred {{thousand}} dollars away from Boston." [...] Then he turned to Mr. Cooke. [...] "The gentleman was aboard your boat, sir, when you left that country place of yours,--what d'ye call it?--Mohair? Thank you, sir." [...] And he wiped the water from his brow. [...] "And they're <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was on Bear Island with ye? Sure, sir, and I can't see why a gentleman of your standing would be wanting to get him over the border. But I must do my duty. Begging your pardon, Mr. Crocker," [...] he added, with a bow to me.|$|E
60|$|He {{was going}} to break off the {{discourse}} upon {{the occasion of the}} Chilian's returning, who was just come in from his hunting, <b>telling</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> would talk farther of it by the way; but I told him I could not quite dismiss the subject, because I must bespeak him to make some mention of it to the Chilian, that he might, on his account, be an assistant to our men, as we saw he was capable of being, in their passing by those difficult ways, and for their supply of provisions, &c. Trouble not yourself with that, seignior, said he, for when your men come, the care shall be mine; I will come myself as far as this wealthy Chilian's, and procure them all the assistance this place can afford them, and do anything that offers to forward them in the undertaking.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Instead of that, he'll {{now have}} all. I shall pay the same, if not more. For you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> an unconscionable dog, a ravenous rascal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is {{a lively}} lad. He is a prodigious {{favourite}} here, and I {{should not be}} surprised if Monmouth made him his heir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That tall, smooth-faced man, {{in a high}} hat, {{who came}} with the lady," [...] said the clerk {{severely}} and concisely,--"didn't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was gone?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had often}} noticed the day fireman {{staring at me}} in a curious way. At last, one day, he spoke. He began by {{swearing}} me to secrecy. He had been warned by the superintendent not to tell me, and in <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was risking his job. He told me of the day coal-passer and the night coal-passer, and of the wages they had received. I was doing for thirty dollars a month what they had received eighty dollars for doing. He would have told me sooner, the fireman said, {{had he not been}} so certain that I would break down under the work and quit. As it was, I was killing myself, and all to no good purpose. I was merely cheapening the price of labour, he argued, and keeping two men out of a job.|$|E
60|$|My next craft was the Camillus, a {{ship that}} was bound to Greenock, via Charleston. We got to the latter port without accident, and took in a cargo of cotton. The ship was all ready for sailing of a Saturday, and the captain had gone ashore, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> would be on board early in the morning, when we could haul out and go to sea, should the wind be favourable. I gave the people their Saturday's night, {{and went into the}} cabin to freshen the nip, myself. I took a glass or two, and {{certainly}} had more in me than is good for a man, though I was far from being downright drunk. In a word, I had too much, though I could have carried a good deal more, on a pinch. The steward had gone ashore, and there being no second-mate, I was all alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean about}} my being a mere girl, almost {{a child when}} I married him. Naturally {{he wanted to take}} charge of {{everything}} and leave nothing to me. And quite as naturally he didn't notice that now I am a woman, grown up altogether. And it's been necessary to do things. And naturally, Mr. Brumley, they shocked and upset him. But he sees now so clearly, he wrote to me, such a fair letter--an unusual letter--quite different from when he talks--it surprised me, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> wanted me to feel free, that he meant to make me--to arrange things that is, so that I should feel free and more able to go about as I pleased. It was a generous letter, Mr. Brumley. Generous about all sorts of affairs that there had been between us. He said things, quite kind things, not like the things he has ever said before----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{making him}} clean up everything, {{ready for the}} next," [...] {{explained}} the mate, grimly. [...] "And he 'ad the cheek to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> improving-- improving!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I'm {{just running}} round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes's. Want {{to fix it}} up. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> round there in Dillon's.|$|R
6000|$|... "But can {{the king}} gie her mercy?" [...] said Jeanie, earnestly. [...] "Some folk <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> canna gie mercy {{in cases of}} mur in cases like hers." ...|$|R
