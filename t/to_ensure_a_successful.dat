Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000.

The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.|$|E
25|$|The celebration {{has been}} {{traced back to}} the 14th century but may have earlier, pre-Christian origins {{involving}} the celebration of the March equinox; The origins of the word dyngus are obscure; it may come from the German Dingeier ("the eggs that are owed") or Dingnis ("ransom"). The occurrence of the celebration across the western Slav countries (plus Hungary, whose inhabitants' forebears conquered a region that was inhabited by Slavs) suggests a common origin in pagan mythology, most likely a link with the Slavic goddesses of fertility. It may possibly be related to the tradition of watering the Corn Mother, who made crops grow and was represented {{in the form of a}} doll or wreath made from corn.

40|$|Restaurant {{customers}} {{appreciate the}} convenience {{of being able to}} make restaurant reservations online, but they also like the personal touch of telephone reservations. A study of 696 restaurant customers found that nearly one-third had made an online reservation. Those who made reservations online tended to be younger than those who did not, and online users also ate out more frequently. Those who made online reservations considered those reservations to be significantly more convenient than telephone reservations, and the online users also thought that websites gave more information about a restaurant than what they learned by calling on the telephone. At the same time, those online users felt that they had a better personal connection with the restaurant when they made telephone reservations. This tradeoff between efficiency and service perceptions points to a strategy of offering reservations via both methods. Emphasizing {{the convenience of}} online reservations may encourage customers to use the website, and that will give restaurant operators more information about their customers. Whether a restaurant uses a third-party reservation service or builds its own website, one key <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> reservations process is to make the electronic process as straightforward as possible...|$|R

25|$|Upper Paleolithic humans {{produced}} {{works of}} art such as cave paintings, Venus figurines, animal carvings, and rock paintings. Upper Paleolithic art {{can be divided into}} two broad categories: figurative art such as cave paintings that clearly depicts animals (or more rarely humans); and nonfigurative, which consists of shapes and symbols. Cave paintings have been interpreted {{in a number of ways}} by modern archaeologists. The earliest explanation, by the prehistorian Abbe Breuil, interpreted the paintings as a form of magic designed <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> hunt. However, this hypothesis fails to explain the existence of animals such as saber-toothed cats and lions, which were not hunted for food, and the existence of half-human, half-animal beings in cave paintings. The anthropologist David Lewis-Williams has suggested that Paleolithic cave paintings were indications of shamanistic practices, because the paintings of half-human, half-animal paintings and the remoteness of the caves are reminiscent of modern hunter-gatherer shamanistic practices. Symbol-like images are more common in Paleolithic cave paintings than are depictions of animals or humans, and unique symbolic patterns might have been trademarks that represent different Upper Paleolithic ethnic groups. Venus figurines have evoked similar controversy. Archaeologists and anthropologists have described the figurines as representations of goddesses, pornographic imagery, apotropaic amulets used for sympathetic magic, and even as self-portraits of women themselves.|$|E

40|$|Flanged joints {{on large}} {{diameter}} flanges can prove problematic to seal successfully with many factors contributing <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> operation. One such factor is stud bolt loading contributing to stress and deflection of the flanged joint. This investigation {{involves the use}} of finite element analysis (F. E.

The level of stud bolt force selected must ensure the joint is sufficiently tight to avoid leakage. However, the force must not be excessive causing damage. The flanged joint is located on the channel head of a shell and tube heat exchanger. For the purposes of this project, the educational version of ANSYS 5. 5 was used thus a number of critical assumptions were made to operate within the restrictions of the software. As a comparative check of the F. E. A method, a conventional method termed the target load bolt-up method was employed. The analysis results using both methods, when interpreted, indicated the flange was not excessively stressed. Field monitoring by observation of the flanged joint for signs of leakage and other detrimental effects indicates the stud bolt load selected is acceptable...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Improving apricot fruit quality {{delivered}} to consumers is key <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> apricot industry. Previous {{studies have focused}} on effects of either soluble solids content (SSC) or fruit firmness on consumer preferences, and results have been equivocal. This study evaluated the effects of crop load and harvestmaturity how they affected on fruit SSC and firmness, and on subsequent consumer preferences. RESULTS: SSC of apricotswas an important factor onlywhen fruitwere firmer than 15 Nand notimmature. When fruitwere softer than 15 N, SSC had little influence on consumer liking. In general, consumers preferred fruit thatwere grown on trees thinned to approximately 10 - 20 %less than typical commercial crop loads andwere harvested in a moremature condition. Consumers also preferred fruit that had a higher sugar/acid ratio or BrimA value, which is the ²ix - k נtitratable acidity, where k is a constant that varies between species and cultivars depending on the specific acids and sugars present. High apricot flavour and juiciness were associated with greater sweetness. CONCLUSION: Management practices that increase fruit SSC and sugar/acid ratio, such as reducing crop load, will improve consumer satisfaction as long as fruit are harvested at an adequate maturity stage and are maintained in storage so that they do not soften too quickly.
