5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow <b>tremor</b> {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD <b>tremor</b> is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of <b>tremor</b> is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, other symptoms, such as ataxia, <b>tremor</b> or sensory losses, do {{not have}} proven treatments.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tremors</b> are {{reported}} {{as the most}} frequent neurological manifestation of Wilson′s disease (WD) in some series.

50|$|The <b>Tremors</b> {{franchise}} is {{a monster}} movie series centering on the vicious attacks of subterranean worm-like creatures known as Graboids. It began in 1990 with the successful release of <b>Tremors,</b> which spawned four direct-to-video films; three sequels (<b>Tremors</b> 2: Aftershocks, <b>Tremors</b> 3: Back to Perfection and <b>Tremors</b> 5: Bloodlines) and a prequel (<b>Tremors</b> 4: The Legend Begins).|$|R
50|$|The film is {{the first}} {{installment}} of the <b>Tremors</b> franchise, and was followed by four direct-to-video sequels titled, <b>Tremors</b> 2: Aftershocks (1996), <b>Tremors</b> 3: Back to Perfection (2001), <b>Tremors</b> 4: The Legend Begins (2004), and <b>Tremors</b> 5: Bloodlines (2015).

5000|$|Burt Gummer is {{a fictional}} character, played by actor Michael Gross, from the <b>Tremors</b> film series {{and the short}} lived SciFi Channel TV program of the same name. Appearing in <b>Tremors,</b> <b>Tremors</b> 2: Aftershocks, <b>Tremors</b> 3: Back to Perfection, <b>Tremors</b> 5: Bloodlines, and most episodes of the TV series, Burt Gummer is a {{firearms}} enthusiast and a paranoid survivalist. He and his former wife, Heather Gummer (played by Reba McEntire), were the first persons in the film series to directly kill a Graboid. He has an [...] "overkill" [...] approach to trouble and takes himself deadly seriously. Although he is only the central character in <b>Tremors</b> 3 and the TV series, his eccentric personality {{has made him a}} favorite among <b>Tremors</b> fans and the de facto star of the franchise, along with the vicious Graboids who oppose him. His ancestor, Hiram Gummer (also played by Gross), appears in <b>Tremors</b> 4: The Legend Begins. He finds out he has a son Travis B.

5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the <b>tremor</b> in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution. The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the <b>tremor,</b> though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in Cuautepec.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting <b>tremor,</b> or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, <b>tremor</b> at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.|$|E
5000|$|The Graboid is {{a fictional}} species of [...] {{that acts as}} the main {{antagonist}} of the <b>Tremors</b> franchise.

5|$|Seismologists {{reported}} that the earthquakes {{were part of a}} prolonged aftershock sequence associated with the major magnitude 7.1 earthquake of September 2010, which includes the February 2011 event. They were succeeded by multiple lighter aftershocks; the strongest, a moderate magnitude 5.1 ML struck a minute after the event. Another <b>tremor</b> 5.0 ML struck the region two days later. Despite significant energy release, the earthquakes were believed to have increased the risk of an additional aftershock of similar magnitude; calculations from GNS Science indicated a 23 percent probability of a magnitude 6.0–6.9 ML earthquake occurring in the Canterbury aftershock zone within the 12 months following the event. Weeks later, a magnitude 5.4 ML <b>tremor</b> jolted Christchurch overnight on 22 June, causing additional damage and prompting evacuations.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as insomnia, delirium, cognitive deficits, <b>tremor,</b> hallucinations, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|Buildings swayed {{with the}} <b>tremor</b> in Mexico City, {{prompting}} evacuations and causing panic among many. Following the quake, police patrolled city streets for safety reasons and damage assessments {{were carried out}} across the affected region. There were no casualties, though two local police stations suffered slight damage. A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event, of which the strongest measured a magnitude of 4.1(ML).|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{estimated}} the locations and focal mechanisms of the triggered <b>tremors</b> in the Hinagu active fault zone. We found that five <b>tremors</b> were located beneath the seismogenic zone {{and seem to}} align the strike direction of the fault. These {{results suggest that the}} <b>tremors</b> occurred near the deeper extension of the Hinagu fault zone. The Japan Meteorological Agency detected low-frequency events around the Hinagu fault zone in 2004 and 2005 (Fig.  3). However, they were not triggered by the surface wave arrivals shown in this study and were located far from the <b>tremors,</b> and therefore, it is assumed that these events were not related to the <b>tremors.</b>|$|R
30|$|Non-volcanic <b>tremors</b> {{triggered}} by surface waves from teleseismic events {{have been detected}} all over the world. Most studies have investigated <b>tremors</b> that were located near or on plate boundaries such as subduction zones (Miyazawa and Brodsky 2008; Rubinstein et al. 2009; Yabe and Ide 2013), transform boundary zones (Peng et al. 2009), and collision zones (Chao et al. 2012). However, non-volcanic <b>tremors</b> are rarely detected away from plate boundaries. Obara (2012) found that triggered <b>tremors</b> occurred near a volcano and an active fault zone in Hokkaido, Japan and Kita et al. (2014) showed through analysis of seismic attenuation that such <b>tremors</b> occurred in a collision zone.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tremors</b> {{present to}} the {{practitioner}} a problem that can be solved clinically.

5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. Of the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) <b>tremor</b> at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the strongest and final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention <b>tremor,</b> and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E
5|$|In 132, Zhang {{introduced}} an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal {{direction of a}} distant earthquake.

5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, <b>tremor,</b> and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{aftershocks}} {{occurred after}} the main <b>tremor.</b> The first four (of magnitude 2.8, 2.2, 4.2 and 3.4) occurred within 12hours {{of the main}} shock. A 2.5-magnitude shock occurred just after midnight on August 25, followed at 05:07 UTC by the strongest, a magnitude 4.5 aftershock that woke many residents in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and was felt {{as far away as}} New England, Georgia, and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Other {{causes that}} can {{secondarily}} produce parkinsonism are stroke and drugs. Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal <b>tremor</b> or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} on neonatal <b>tremors</b> or "jitteriness" or, as described by Precthl "hyperexcitability syndrome" including <b>tremors</b> and increased resistance to passive movement. AIM: To describe the evolution of signs and the outcome at one year in low risk term born infants with neonatal <b>tremors</b> persisting beyond 10 days. SUBJECTS: 84 low risk term born neonates with <b>tremors</b> at birth and persisting after 10 days, underwent a longitudinal neurological assessment {{paying attention to the}} evolution of <b>tremors</b> and increased resistance to passive movement. RESULTS: At 1 month 74 of the 84 infants had persistent <b>tremors,</b> isolated in 27 or associated with increased resistance to passive movement in the other 47. The remaining 10 had isolated increased resistance to passive movement and none had a normal assessment. The percentage of infants with a normal assessment progressively increased at 6, 9 and 12 months (34. 5 %, 77 %, 93 % respectively). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that neonatal <b>tremors</b> can have a variable evolution and rate of resolution, with 70 % of recovery by 9 months with a normal outcome at 24 months in all. The risk of persistence of signs (at 12 months) in infants with either isolated <b>tremors</b> or increased resistance to passive movements is lower than in the subgroup with both signs at one month...|$|R
