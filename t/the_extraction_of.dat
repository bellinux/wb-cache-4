40|$|In {{this study}} the {{phenolic}} compounds piceid, resveratrol and emodin were extracted from P. cuspidatum roots using ultrasound-assisted extraction. Multiple response surface methodology {{was used to}} optimize <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> conditions <b>of</b> these phenolic compounds. A three-factor and three-level Box-Behnken experimental design was employed to evaluate {{the effects of the}} operation parameters, including extraction temperature (30 - 70 °C), ethanol concentration (40 %- 80 %), and ultrasonic power (90 - 150 W), on <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> yields <b>of</b> piceid, resveratrol, and emodin. The statistical models built from multiple response surface methodology were developed for <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> yields <b>of</b> multi-phenolic components. Based on <b>the</b> model, <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> yields <b>of</b> piceid, resveratrol, and emodin can be improved by controlling <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> parameters. Under <b>the</b> optimum conditions, <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> yields <b>of</b> piceid, resveratrol and emodin were 10. 77 mg/g, 3. 82 mg/g and 11. 72 mg/g, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{study on}} solvent <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> {{a mixture of}} light rare earths ions (La(III), Nd(III) and Ce(IV)) from nitric and sulphuric acid {{solutions}} with di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA) in kerosene as an extractant has been carried out. The influences of D 2 EHPA and acid concentrations on <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency <b>of</b> rare earth metal ions were evaluated. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> percentage <b>of</b> La, Nd and Ce decreased as the acids concentrations increased. On <b>the</b> contrary, <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency <b>of</b> these ions increased as D 2 EHPA concentration increased. <b>The</b> utmost <b>extraction</b> percentage <b>of</b> La, Nd and Ce (99. 4 %, 99. 7 % and 100 % respectively) was extracted from 0. 1 M HNO 3 using 1. 0 M D 2 EHPA. <b>The</b> order <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studied rare earth elements by D 2 EHPA decreased in the series of Ce(IV) >Nd(III) >La(III) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{effectively}} utilize ilmenite and recycle KOH solution, <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> behaviours <b>of</b> titanium {{and other}} associated impurities in the decomposition process of ilmenite by highly concentrated KOH solution were studied.

The effects of various parameters, including reaction temperature, KOH concentration, reaction time, alkali-to-ore mass ratio, and particle size on <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> rate <b>of</b> titanium and other impurities were examined. When the finely ground ore (58 - 75 mu m) reacted with KOH solution (80 wt%) in an alkali-to-ore mass ratio of 7 : 1 at 260 degrees C for 60 min, almost complete <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> titanium was achieved, while <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> rate <b>of</b> aluminium was 78 % and that of other impurities was less than 22 %.
