50|$|In 1975, he {{attended}} a tryout camp held by <b>the</b> expansion Hartford <b>Bicentennials</b> of <b>the</b> North American Soccer League. He impressed the team enough to gain a contract. While he was a forward in college, <b>the</b> <b>Bicentennials</b> moved Chandler to defense. After the 1976 season, <b>the</b> <b>Bicentennials</b> moved to New Haven, Connecticut and adopted the name, <b>the</b> Connecticut <b>Bicentennials.</b> Chandler played nine games of the 1977 season with Connecticut. The team moved again {{at the end of}} the season, this time to Oakland, California. However, Chandler did not remain with the team, but signed with the Tampa Bay Rowdies as a free agent for the 1978 season. He broke the tibia in his right leg after only four games with the Rowdies. He lost the rest of the season, then rebroke his tibia in July 1979. He finally took the field again for the Rowdies during the 1980-1981 NASL indoor season. He played 13 games.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bicentennial</b> dollars {{were the}} first of the three {{denominations}} to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975. The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975. The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975. Over 220 million were struck. <b>The</b> <b>Bicentennial</b> design was not used after 1976; sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.|$|E
5|$|The Cann Valley Highway was {{designated}} a state highway on 10 August 1960, and was {{formerly known as}} Cann Valley Road.

It was again renamed as the Monaro Highway on 25 October 1996 to match the highway to which it connects at the NSW border.

5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of <b>the</b> <b>bicentennial</b> of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>bicentennial</b> {{celebration of}} the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1877, {{residents}} of Ridgefield have remembered {{the battle with}} some form of anniversary ceremony every twenty-five years. A full day tribute was hosted at former Connecticut Governor Phineas C. Lounsbury's Town Street mansion {{in conjunction with the}} town's bicentennial celebration in 1908. The 150th anniversary affair in 1927 featured the publication of George Lounsbury Rockwell's History of Ridgefield, and the 200th anniversary was held a year early to tie in with America's bicentennial celebration in 1976. <b>The</b> <b>bicentennial</b> and 225th anniversary celebrations included re-enactments of the battle, for which portions of Town Street (now Main Street) were covered with dirt for sake of authenticity.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican {{orchestra}} conductor Alondra de la Parra on {{the musical}} project Travieso Carmesí, an album created {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bicentennial</b> of Mexico celebration. While conducting research to find songs for that album, Lafourcade studied Mexican singer-songwriter Agustín Lara catalog and decided to record a tribute album with his songs. Released in 2012, Mujer Divina earned her accolades for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Long Form Music Video at the 14th Latin Grammy Awards. Two years later, Lafourcade traveled to Veracruz (Mexico), Colombia, and Cuba {{in a search for}} musical inspiration and a balance between heart, mind and body. She has said that composition of her new music for Hasta la Raíz was closely woven with the experience of singing Lara's music.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{cityscape}} includes renovated and refurbished factory buildings, mid−rise housing, {{single family}} homes, and office buildings.

On the east end of the waterfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the city's main library, and third largest in Pennsylvania, host the USS Niagara. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.|$|E

5|$|The Place de la Bastille still {{occupies}} most of {{the location}} of the Bastille, and the Opéra Bastille was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate <b>the</b> <b>bicentennial</b> anniversary of the storming of the prison. The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the River Seine had been dug out {{at the start of the}} 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the Bassin de l'Arsenal, linked to the Canal Saint Martin, but is now a marina for pleasure boats, while the Promenade Plantée links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.|$|E
5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to <b>the</b> <b>Bicentennial</b> Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring <b>the</b> <b>bicentennial</b> of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
