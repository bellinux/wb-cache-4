25|$|Following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the {{predominant}} anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth {{as a form}} of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.|$|E
25|$|Persepolis was by {{no means}} the only large scale Achaemenid project, as Susa also hosted a similar {{structure}} initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of Naqsh-e Rustam, the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire. Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son Xerxes the Great, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.|$|E

According to the International Reading Association, while reading it [...] "children may be helped to understand <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> always someone's interpretation...

500|$|In {{accordance}} with the Marxist doctrine <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> made by collective action, not individuals, Eisenstein forbore to single out any person in his film, but rather focused on the [...] "mass protagonist". Soviet film critics hailed this approach, including the dramaturge and critic, Adrian Piotrovsky, writing for the Leningrad newspaper Krasnaia gazeta: The hero is the sailors' battleship, the Odessa crowd, but characteristic figures are snatched here and there from the crowd. For a moment, like a conjuring trick, they attract all the sympathies of the audience: like the sailor Vakulinchuk, like the young woman and child on the Odessa Steps, but they emerge only to dissolve once more into the mass. This signifies: no film stars but a film of real-life types.|$|E

500|$|His Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage, 1832) {{opens with}} a historical-philosophical {{discussion}} {{of the history of}} humankind in which Mickiewicz argues <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> the history of now-unrealized freedom that awaits many oppressed nations in the future. It is followed by a longer [...] "moral catechism" [...] aimed at Polish émigrés. The book sets out a messianist metaphor of Poland as the [...] "Christ of nations". Described by Wyka as a propaganda piece, it was relatively simple, using biblical metaphors and the like to reach less-discriminating readers. [...] It became popular not only among Poles but, in translations, among some other peoples, primarily those which lacked their own sovereign states. The Books were influential in framing Mickiewicz's image among many not as that of a poet and author but as that of ideologue of freedom.|$|E

Having viewed the timestream, he learned <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> predestined, and seeks to change his fate by triggering more temporal paradoxes, an objective which demanded Raziel's temporary destruction. It is revealed that Raziel is destined to be consumed by the Soul Reaver, thus becoming the soul-devouring entity trapped within the weapon. With Raziel's help, Kain is able to defy history and prevent his own pre-ordained death, and, in return, he saves Raziel from being consumed by the Reaver at the story's climax. However, this alteration putatively changes history for the worse, leading into the events of Blood Omen 2 and [...]|$|E

500|$|Historian Louis Green {{writes that}} the Cronica was written with three general {{assumptions}} about morality which shaped {{the organization of the}} work, [...] " [...] events into recurring patterns of significance." [...] These general assumptions were that excess brings disaster, <b>that</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> governed by a struggle between right and wrong, {{and that there is a}} direct connection between the events of the natural world and the overriding, supernatural and divine will of God who intercedes in these events. For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of Pisa, who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons. Green writes that this story in the Cronica bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek story of Polycrates and his ring in the work of Herodotus. However, Green notes that Villani's [...] "cautionary tales" [...] disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one's unavoidable fate, which Green calls [...] "excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an appropriate measure of sorrow." [...] Villani's adherence to Medieval Christianity allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of sin and insult to God. He stressed that those who gained prestige would fall prey to pride; confidence in their position would then lead them to sin, and sin would bring on a stage of decline. Villani wrote: ...|$|E
