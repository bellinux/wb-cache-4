25|$|The {{secretary}}bird or {{secretary bird}} (Sagittarius serpentarius) {{is a very}} large, mostly <b>terrestrial</b> <b>bird</b> of prey. Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the sub-Saharan region. Although {{a member of the}} order Accipitriformes, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, hawks, vultures, and harriers, it is given its own family, Sagittariidae.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "three now {{cosmopolitan}} commensal rodent pest species" [...] (the brown rat, {{the black}} rat {{and the house}} mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>bird</b> species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum. This approach has been successful {{on the island of}} Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{discussion}} of relationships with range size, {{it is important to}} define which range is under investigation. [...] Gaston (following Udvardy) describes the potential range of a species as the theoretical maximum range that a species could occupy should all barriers to dispersal be removed, while the realized range is the portion of the potential range that the species currently occupies. The realized range can be further subdivided, for example, into the breeding and non-reproductive ranges. Explicit consideration of a particular portion of the realized range in analysis of range size can significantly influence the results. For example, many seabirds forage over vast areas of ocean, but breed only on small islands, thus the breeding range is significantly smaller than the non-reproductive range. However, in many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>bird</b> species the pattern is reversed, with the winter (non-reproductive) range somewhat smaller than the breeding range.|$|E
